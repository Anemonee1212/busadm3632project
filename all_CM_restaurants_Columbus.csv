The Guild House,269,4,4,11/24/17,"Like the dark wood tones. All CM establishments I've been to have an air of sophistication, prevalent here. However, most of us where dressed in jeans and nice shirts, and I never felt out of place. Interesting that you have to enter this eatery via The Joseph. I wonder how many people forgo this place cause they're looking for a ""front door"". Service for our group of 14 was great! Our lone waitress did a great job keeping things rolling. She didn't rush us, checked in all the right times, gladly left us to chatting after eating. Very well managed. Lamb Burger. Yes, very, very tasty. Soft buttery bun. Fresh tomato topping. The meat was done just right - I asked for medium. Juicy. Great flavor. Chose their Cauliflower side dish. Get it. I want to find that recipe, it was so good! Not swimming in a dressing. The edamame and pickled onion were a perfect touch. Excellent gathering for Thanksgiving Day. They had a prix-fix turkey meal, if you were feeling the traditional avenue. Our time was never taken for granted.",Gwen W.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2010/12/17,"This is technically attached to the Le Meridien, and if that makes it a ""hotel restaurant"" then it's one of the better ones I've been to. I typically turn my nose up...but I probably shouldn't, at least, not in trendy downtown areas like this.First off, get the prime rib cap. In fact, I would strongly consider ordering two (or even three) of these to make an entire meal out of. Awesome, tender, juicy, flavorful meat, with a perfect amount of salt and pepper plus a good amount of bleu cheese and mustard on the side. We were not disappointed with this recommendation from the wait staff. We also tried the smoked trout - which is served interestingly, with the protein and other items in a mason jar, and toast on the side (points for the mason jar, so trendy) and was also good, but is really overshadowed by that prime rib cab.For entree, two of the three of us had the pork. I somehow expected it to be a chop, but was not sad when it turned out to be nicely sliced pork off the bone. Not overcooked (people are so afraid to undercook pork, and I guess I get why, but it just becomes sawdust) and I really liked the sour apple cabbage. Not sauerkraut, mind you, not as strong of a sour, picked flavor, but getting there. I am not a sauerkraut lover, so this was OK with me. The pork had good flavor, and the sour savory combo of the cabbage and the brown butter sauce was great. Both of us were very happy with this.Wait staff were very helpful, providing a couple of spot on recommendations, so at least in the case of my particular waitress, it's worth listening to what they have to say. My standard line - I don't know when I'll be back in the area, but if I ever am, I would absolutely go back.",Andrew T.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,9/27/17,"Visited as part of Columbus Burger Week. Pretty good burger: the meat was rarer than my medium rare order but delicious, and the bun was solid.  But far too much mayonaise. Some more lettuce, other vegetables, or pickles would've helped to cut the mayo.  Service was fine.Decent tasting, not terribly innovative--definitely Cameron Mitchell restaurant material. (Joined others on this visit, not my first choice)",Will C.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,12/13/17,"Everything about this place was pure class. We ordered a few dishes and my favorite was the gnocchi with fava beans. I definitely plan to come back, and hope to bring my parents here one day!",Mary M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2008/1/17,"After my latest visit to The Guild House, it's now on my short list of favorites!!!! We came on a Thursday night for a random date night after changing our plans and not having dinner where we initially intended. I am so glad we decided to come here instead even though I may or may not have been a little bit under dressed in jeans :/ but still everyone was lovely and welcoming. We were seated right away and got to sit at this small table near the fire place and it was just too cute! We had the stuffed poblanos, snapper, sea bass, and finished with the chocolate/peanut butter torte. This was one of THE best meals I've had so far this year!! The stuffed poblanos were perfect for sharing with 2 people since there were 2 peppers. I actually thought it was quite spicy, but my date didn't think so at all. We loved this so much 10/10 will order again next time! My entree, the snapper, oh my GOSH it was so good!! It was crispy and mushroomy and also saucy and the fish was perfect to me! I also really liked the smooth sunchoke puree even though I had no clue what it was when I was eating it (it's some sort of root vegetable). I really really had to restrain myself from licking my plate. I tried my date's sea bass too! That lobster broth was just soo flavorful!I mean I kind of didn't understand some of the ingredients on the menu but omg everything we had was just bursting with flavor! Every single dish we ordered we completely finished!! #cleanplateclub",Rosalie W.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2001/6/18,"While I never ate here, the service at the door was top notch. The Resturant was very busy the maÌ¨tre d' called 4 Restaurants and booked us a reservation at a very comparable restaurant. We can not wait to go back and try the food!",Jana J.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,10/16/17,"Visited for the first time while in Columbus for the weekend and absolutely loved it. For starters, the space is beautiful. We sat in the bar area, which was equally charming and had great service. The restaurant is known for its farm-to-table concept so all of the food is at its peak of freshness. The cocktails are handcrafted and unique. I had a bourbon cocktail and a champagne martini (yes, I was willing to set myself up for a hangover). It was 10:30pm so we didn't come in for dinner, but split a couple of apps - toast, and an order of french fries. The toast didn't sound like much of anything from the menu description, but we went with our bartender's recommendation and were blown away. I don't even know how something with 4 ingredients can taste so good. Just get it!",Nelli B.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2009/5/17,"Cameron Mitchell does so many things well, and even though the company has expanded and opened several new restaurants in the past couple of years, the quality has not slipped. Solid 4.5 stars here for the Guild House.The new-build space is perfect for the (new) Short North area - bistro, high ceilings, plush seating, lots of glass and colored lights, along with tall windows facing High Street. Their music selection was more dubstep/dance mix, which was interesting and awesome (I tried to be subtle about Shazam-ing but no-go) - seemed to fit with the vibe.Service here, as with all CM restaurants, is excellent. They understand that for the majority of folks coming in, this will be a birthday/anniversary visit, or they're coming in from out of town, or stopping in for happy hour/Restaurant Week - and Guild House does a great job making their spot an occasion destination even if it's not going to be your weekly hotspot. [High-end service tends to fall down in this area; why you would treat anyone as a throw-away table is beyond me, but when you have a limited number of regular-repeat diners, it's especially egregious.] Everyone got great service at Guild House - we, the Restaurant Week folks, the people who were there on what looked like a first date, the conventioneers wearing khakis - every table in our service area was given equal time and attention.ANYWAY. The food! We were the Restaurant Week folks, and got to try a nice cross section of things. I had a great quinoa salad, the spouse a poblano pepper appetizer, and their salmon (I know, but I like to eat fish where I know it will be prepared properly). Dessert was a super-rich carrot cake and chocolate torte - the spouse heroically attempted to finish the carrot cake for me but alas.  Overall? The food was CM-quality modern American, which is to say a solid 4.5 out of 5.Having visited for dinner, I'm excited to try their brunch,  they've convinced me to be a repeat diner at Guild House.",Donna O.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2012/11/17,"This is a delicious restaurant in a fun, up and coming part of Columbus. Great use of space, our server was really funny and incredibly knowledgeable. Next time we're in Columbus, we're there! #gobucks",Matt S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,9/21/17,"Charming and elegant spot on the ground floor of the Le MÌ©ridien hotel in the famous Short North district of Columbus.  Very extensive wine list caters to all tastes with a good selection of local and European wines for all budgets.Appetizers are small and light yet satisfying with the duck pÌ¢tÌ© and the prime rib cap really packing taste. Seafood entree choices are solid with the sea bass balancing a crispy crust and white tenderness in a rich broth base. The menu is seasonal so ingredients are fresh but dishes variable.  Expect to drop at least 75 for a full meal.  Service is professional and very prompt",Daniel G.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2001/9/18,This place exemplifies service and food. Unbelievable experience from drinks to dessert. Our server was amazing and extremely helpful in helping pick out the best items on the menu. The vegetable lasagna was like nothing I have ever tasted before. The steak was mouthwatering and the tuna appetizer was the best I've ever had. Well done guild house!!!!,Julie K.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,12/30/17,"Had a delicious New Year's Eve dinner here, one day early.  Riley was an outstanding server, and our entrees of scallops and salmon wee perfectly prepared.  My gray goose martini was awesome (they had blue cheese stuffed olives-yay!), and we really liked the apple fritter desert.  Not a big fan of the bread with olives (?) baked in.  This is weird, since I LOVE olives!The dining area is relaxing and beautiful.  One star off for having to wait over 10 minutes in the freezing cold anteroom for the valet to get our car, and then pay $10 for it.  This took the glow off of an otherwise exceptional dining experience.",Lisa J.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,8/25/17,"This place is one of my favorites in Columbus! The perfect spot for a cozy anniversary dinner or a small birthday celebration! The decor is to die for and it's attached to Le Meridien hotel which has a great bar and awesome art! All the food at the Guild House is spectacular, but the appetizers are a bit on the small size.  The wine list is expansive, but opt for a signature cocktail instead! They are all delicious and unique. The hospitality here is A+ as well! Like any other Cameron Mitchell establishment, they aim to please. Of course the air conditioning is on full blast (why do all restaurants do this!?) but I dressed for the 80å¡ outdoor weather. The waiter brought down a blanket from the hotel! Follow my food adventures @madeatss on Instagram!",Madeline C.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,12/30/17,"Been here 5 times, breakfast, lunch and dinners, really good food, service was glacially slow every time...",Jim M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,7/18/17,"Outstanding lamb burger. If I'm ever back in Columbus, definitely returning to order this again. My side of cauliflower was bland and no sign of the avocado that was listed, but my tequila cocktail was very good. Classy spot, upscale. Perfect for business meals.",Norma G.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2005/7/17,"Their happy hour must be a well kept secret that's not so secret! Half off the raw, market, and appetizers (basically, half the menu)- a classy place with classy food, great deal!The beets are delish and different from the way most prepare. A healthy portion of both red and golden beets roasted with a bit of granola crunch and light creamy yogurt, served with a few beet chips. So so good, I couldn't even share! The brussels sprouts are also really tasty, especially with the sweet mustard dressing and grated white cheddar on top. The prime rib cap is an amazing deal during happy hour, and the sweet onion relish is addictive and good enough to eat by the fork on it's own. The prime rib itself is seasoned perfectly, although the piece I was served was mostly fat. Not sure I'd pay full price, but I'd get it again during happy hour!Lots of options are extremely fair happy hour prices- highly recommended!",Amy S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,2012/10/17,"Every time I eat here i get sick. This has gone one since they opened. I wouldn't call the menu groundbreaking. The stuffed chicken is the best thing on the menu. The staff is friendly and orders arrive quickly. Sometimes the flavors are a little off or bland. The space is very nicely done though.",Danny R.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,11/13/16,"New York ambiance in Columbus.. Love this place for all occasions!All the appetizers - especially the lamb chops have been delicious. Strongly recommend this place for special dinner.",Merve C.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,8/19/17,"Probably one of the better restaurants in Columbus. I've been visiting Columbus from Chicago a lot with a new Buckeye in the family and have been collecting my favorite places to eat. This is up there among the best meals I've had in Columbus.Breakfast was delicious. Portions are of the small size, but flavors were on point. We ordered the Simply Eggs, Lobster and Eggs and Smoked Chicken Hash. Our favorite is the Smoked Chicken Hash. The tortilla chips were so good, I wish they gave you more of that. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked. I ordered my eggs over hard which I believe is better on this dish than poached.Coffee has to be one of my favorite cups so far. Service was okay. Took them awhile to take our order, but as soon as they realize we were fast movers, they were responsive. My only question would be is the orange juice free? They greet you by offering you orange juice and/or coffee. We were all confused is the orange juice complimentary or would we be charged. They didn't charge us for the 4 cups of coffee so it made it even more confusing.You can tell there is a lot of pride in the restaurant. The decor, the flatware, serve ware, staff, the ambiance has to be by far the best in the city. Definitely not to be missed and would be perfect for a special occasion. Can't wait to try dinner!",Maleesa X.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2012/7/17,"My husband and I tried this place for the first time last night and LOVED just about everything that we ate! For appetizers we had the lamb chops that were amazing and cooked medium rare.. not at our request, but it was still delicious! Scallops were good, but I wouldn't get them again. My husband got their pork, which I highly recommend if you like pork! Also, make sure that you save room for dessert because their peanut butter chocolate torte is to die for!!! We can't wait to try this place again and we hope that it's just as good the next time!",Aly P.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2001/3/18,"Ate here when i stayed at the Joseph last week. Service was good, and it is a beautiful spot. Had breakfast here and it was good! Next time I will try the lobster breakfast dish. I would recommend.",Dana S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,9/19/17,"Was really searching for something unique in Columbus. The Guild House delivered. Seated at the bar, solo, for business and this place is HIGHLY recommended. Lauren and Alex behind the bar know to craft a cocktail. Get the RYE. On their recommendation, had the prime rib cap appetizer. Amazing. Absolutely delicious. BTW, this was one of four recommendations from the house. Then, I followed it up with the Sea Bass entree. It's a game changer. Seriously, unlike anything I've ever had. Has a broth that is perfect for fish. Dessert was the crisp merengue. Done here. You won't be disappointed. I'm coming back.",Chris W.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,7/16/17,"Amazing all around! For a drink order their primm's.  I recommend the toast for an appetizer, ribeye for dinner with cucumbers and tomatoes as your side. Everyone in our party loved what they ordered, you can't go wrong here!The staff also helped us celebrate a birthday.",Jana N.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2005/6/17,Came here for brunch. The food is very high quality in taste. I got the lobster and eggs which is a drippy egg served ok top of lobster in a cup of butter which is delicious on their toast. The greens are served very scantily though and the portion sizes are very small. Excellent atmosphere though and great service. Great alcohol ratio in their mimosas too.,Elan A.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,2001/1/18,"Disappointed in The Guild House brunch. We have been for dinner and it was fantastic but I do not recommend wasting your money on brunch. When coming to the guild house you expect a certain level of quality... we walked in and were never offered to have our coats taken, was offered orange juice like it was complementary but it's $5/glass and not fresh, and they served us bacon that was frozen and then microwaved. The main dish was mediocre. Hope to see an improvement as the atmosphere was the only good thing about the meal!",Mariah K.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2011/12/17,"Nice place, a bit of a squeeze for comfort in the big dining room. A little pricy but the food is spectacular. Mature feel and welcoming atmosphere.",John T.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,1,2001/1/18,"We have been to the Guild House two times previously and had good experiences. Our latest reservation was at 9:30 pm on New Years Eve after a Blue Jackets game.  We arrived at 9:05 and were told reservations were running 35 minutes late.  At 9:15 we overhead a customer with an 8:30 reservation ask when he would be seated. With no hope of being seated before 10:15, we left. Not a good way to run an upscale restaurant. Doubt that we'll go back.",Steve W.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,12/30/16,Excellent. Awsome atmosphere and menu as well as food and service. I came across this place online looking up the short north and it didnt diappoint. The chicken hash on the breakfast menu was stellar. All the  breakfast looked amazing and i cant wait to come back and try lunch and dinner.,John R.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,8/25/17,"The restaurant is beautiful. Darkly lit, perfect for a date night! We had great service at our table & enjoyed what we ordered. I had the lamb chops with fried rice from the appetizer menu. It was small, but delicious. Overall the portions are small & the prices are high (mine was $18). The menu is also not great for a picky eater! Although our waitress was accommodating and brought my fiancÌ© a grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes, not on the menu.",Jessica H.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2/22/17,"I had never been fortunate to enjoy the offerings of THE GUILD HOUSE until Valentine's Day when friends treated me to a memorable lunch.     I've cherished my love of The Pearl since it opened......THE GUILD HOUSE now ranks in the same category of love.   These two are similar bit different....THE GUILD HOUSE opened my eyes with the visuals of the space.   There must be a backstory on the materials, construction and visual appeal that encompasses this highest quality place to be.SERVICE...PROFESSIONAL SERVICE...ULTIMATE PROFESSIONALS begin your experience with the hostess add you enter.As you're seated the sound is dismissed because you are only able to hear those with you.     Being seated by true caring and focused professionals begins your review of the menu....a menu with the daily highlights.When you read or hear menu offerings, ask questions.

You will have a happy involved belly and an affordable pocket.I believe that when I find something in my world that I'd like others to experience I will always comment.     If you haven't traveled then you will honestly believe you are somewhere other than Columbus when in and enjoying THE GUILD HOUSE.I bet you get the idea one visit and I'm hooked.",Mark W.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,12/29/17,"Absolutely excellent.   Tried the sea bass croquettes. Not too much quantity but excellent.  But beef hash is plentiful and absolutely fabulous, like a beef burgundy!",Hugo T.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,12/20/16,"Guild house is GORGEOUS on the inside. Plenty of lighting, large front windows overlooking high street and a DJ lightly playing music on this Saturday evening.This restaurant is definitely unique new American and you'd be hard pressed to find any dish on the menu you've truly had somewhere else before.We started with the shrimp and grits stuffed poblano pepper and it was amazing! The shrimp pieces are bite size which I appreciate for ease of eating an appetizer. Not very spicy for those afraid of some heat. Just note this is a smaller appetizer and would NOT serve more than 2 people.They do have an extensive wine list with a few medium priced options (around 42$) and a unique cocktail list.For entrees I had the veggie lasagna. I was definitely expected a red sauced based dish but I was pleasantly surprised. These are house made lasagna noodles and the ""sauce"" is thick pesto/avocado like layers. It's hard to describe but this dish had the perfect chew feeling to it.Minus a star because the portions are definitely small (with no sides) at a luxuryish price. Set that mindset going in so you won't be disappointed or expecting to walk away stuffed",Rachael H.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2009/8/17,This place is AMAZING! The ambience was incredible. The place is beautifully decorated and super clean. The menu is unique and well thought out. The service was outstanding. Rezi was our server and she recommended the truffled eggs which is to date the best breakfast I have ever eaten. My husband ate the lobster eggs and he really enjoyed them. I give this establishment 5 stars!,Robin T.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2006/4/17,"My family had graduation brunch here (on a Monday, thankfully), and we all enjoyed it!  There weren't many people, so our service was very attentive.  The decor is rustic and pretty cool.  I had the Lobster and Eggs, and it really was awesome.  It came in a little glass container, so it added to the dining experience by ensuring each bite was perfectly portioned.  The lobster was tasty and buttered, and the caviar was a nice touch.  I felt very satisfied and not stuffed.  If you like Lobster, this is the one to get for brunch!",Rami M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,10/31/17,"First time dining at guild house. Friendly attentive staff. Excellent meals...had Brussels sprouts and parsnip purÌ©e as sides, main entrees were pork and snapper . All were perfectly prepared!",Nina T.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,11/27/16,"This was my first time in Ohio and I was pleasantly surprised at how lovely this restaurant was. Maybe it's just me being a snobbish New Yorker - I was expecting more Mom & Pop-type joints and horrible chain restaurants to dominate the area. The Guild House was visually stunning (high ceilings, glass partition for the backlit bar, birch log and manzanita branch decor, green glass chandeliers, heavy wood tables, fireplace, soft leather sofa, near-passable fake Eames chairs) and the food was beautifully presented and memorable. I ordered the snapper and BF had the sea bass. The snapper wasn't drowning in brown butter and was almost sinfully succulent and flavorful. The vegetables cut through the richness marvelously. The sea bass, presented in a lobster broth, was a tad bit over-salted for my palate was just fine for the BF. For dessert, we had their signature chocolate cherry sundae, with dark chocolate ice cream, cherry granita, cherry compote, and chocolate cake. The portion was generous for the price ($9) and was definitely meant to share. Our server, Aubry, was super friendly and helpful, and didn't rush us at all. I do have to mention that I felt a little bit overdressed - most people showed up in hoodies and fleece vests, which I found odd. Maybe it's just a regional thing.",Ann Y.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2001/11/17,"Went here for brunch on New Years day 2016.Expensive and small portions - but food is decent.  Expect to either shell out the dough or stop at taco bell on the way hom!",LeeAnna S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,1,5/18/17,"Hostess was horrible, couldn't accommodate a party of 7 at 9 PM on Thursday which wasn't the problem. She was reading a book as she told us she couldn't accommodate, also she didn't make eye contact with us as we stood there in shock. She also came across rude but maybe that's because we interrupted her nightly read. Won't be back.",Joshua M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,8/17/17,"Last night was my first visit to The Guild House, but it will not be the last. It started at the bar where, I enjoyed a tequila cocktail (highly recommend!). We then sat at our table and started with the Stuffed Poblano. It was the perfect consistency and the creamy flavor was fantastic. For dinner, I had the Salmon and it truly melted in my mouth. My date had the pork entree. He really enjoyed it and it was good, but I prefer the salmon. Dessert was next and we shared the Torte. That Peanut butter mouse was everything!",Allison V.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,6/17/17,"Everyone I ordered here was great. The seafood was fresh, the wine was exceptional, you definitely feel like you're in a fine dining atmosphere. Our server was exceptional! Highly recommend. It is on the higher end in terms of price point, but it's well worth it",Lauryn S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,10/22/17,I'm all about atmosphere. I'd give this place an A++. The lighting and decor was to perfection. The food was extremely good. Highly recommend the smoked trout appetizer. I wouldn't normally pick it but a must! I don't have any complaints. Noise level was not high and staff was eager and attentive but let you take your time.,Mollie M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2011/1/16,"Stopped in for a quick snack.Service was rushed, but friendly.  Food was good, but not breath taking. Atmosphere was lovely.I think I would have enjoyed my experience more, if I wasn't in such a rush. I think the quality is there, unfortunately, we were in and out. Also, having a direct entrance to Le Meridian probably doesn't help, and just exasperated any minor frustrations I had.",Josh d.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,3/20/17,"Service was the issue. My entree was not what I ordered. The waitress had no excuse. I ate a delicious Sea Bass, instead of scallops. My partner waited over 10 minutes for his entree. Another waitress was hailed- it hadn't been 'fired up'. What?!The menu was soiled- a big no-no in my book. Is this a low end establishment?My partner did not like the corned beef entree- tasted like old, over cooked beef roast with finely chopped vegetables that lacked flavor. The place did offer free valet parking, when asked. The waitress took off the carrot cake dessert and a glass of wine. ( offered after we ordered them).Would we return- for the prices and poor service- no.",Karen G.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,2003/6/17,"Went there this past weekend with some friends. Ordered the chicken and waffles.Once I got my food about 10 minutes after everyone else I was in shock. 4 pieces of chicken (about the size of a chicken nugget) and four pieces of ""waffle"" about 1inch by 1inch (clearly frozen) as it tasted like cardboard. The syrup however was delicious. I'm the future for how expensive they are, I'll avoid at all costs. Service was good and the atmosphere was great. Others at the table said the food was acceptable to good. Your mileage may vary",John F.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,7/13/17,"Good drinks, heavy on the sweet. Location is beautiful but the meat quality has a long way to go. Do not get the ribeye. The scallops are palatable.",Shawn H.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2009/9/17,"Loved. Small portions but fabulous flavors, great variety with lots of veggies and ambiance was killer.",Lisa M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2008/1/16,"This place really is great. Went here for my birthday and enjoyed every single bite. I could have ordered just about everything on the menu. We settled on the cheese plate and hummus for apps, and the ribeye and scallops for dinner. The scallops were the best I've ever had!! I absolutely loved them. We also ordered the cocktail for two and a bottle of wine. I highly highly recommend the cocktail for two. It changes seasonally so no guarantees what you'll get, but it was the best cocktail I've ever had. Amazing flavors. That being said, our server wasn't great. He seemed pretty ambivalent about the whole thing, forgot to tell us the special, messed up my order, didn't know what was in the cocktail, etc. I would have expected more polished servers at a place like this. But it didn't deter me too much. They had the correct order out within a few minutes, and the food really made up for any personnel issues.",Kirby N.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,11/30/15,"Probably my favorite current restaurant in Columbus. The guild house is a special restaurant located in the heart of the short north. It's a concept that falls nothing short of what you might expect of a Cameron Mitchell restaurant. From walking in, you are really transported into a warm environment. From the candles to leather couches, no detail has been spared. The service is friendly, but not standoffish, and the menu is delicious. A local concept, the guild house attempts to use primarily local foods in its menu. The one downside is that I have not noticed the menu changing too often, so it can get a bit repetitive... But it's only a problem if you return far too often as I have for brunch, lunch and dinner! Check out the cocktail for two as well! The porthole infuser is a unique touch I've only seen at the Aviary in Chicago.",Tada Y.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,5/31/16,"Around this time last year, reservations at The Guild House were pretty difficult to come by. Fast forward a year to Memorial Day 2016, and they're already offering 1000 point reservations on OpenTable and sending out 30% off coupons by e-mail. I'm guessing that despite all the stellar reviews on Yelp that say something to the extent of ""It's amazing just because it's a Cameron Mitchell restaurant!"", the Guild House's flaws are starting to show. They're not bad in the sense of needing a 1 or 2 star review. But they're just... ok. They're really missing some of the magic that the more established Cameron Mitchell restaurants have. Living in the Midwest, I've never gone home hungry from a restaurant... until I went to the Guild House. My biggest gripe with this restaurant is how small their dishes are. If you dine here with a child, try ordering their kid's hamburger. There's a pretty good chance that the kid's meal will be larger than whatever $30 adult plate that you order for yourself. That's just ridiculous. I'm not entirely against expensive meals. I'll easily drop $50/person for a meal... as long as I feel that the meal is worth it. I do not feel that a meal here is worth it. I'm also not a huge fan of their menu... it's small, limited, and lacks a clear theme other than ""Expensive stuff."" Really, really... meh.",Kaoru M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,10/25/15,"The Guild House is the Le Meridian, The Joseph's hotel restaurant. However you cannot bill the check to your room so bring your credit card. I ate breakfast (menu based) here two days in a row on the weekend and was pleased both times. The orange juice ($5) is worth a mention - it was so good! One day I got the Smoked Chicken Hash ($13). The portion was rather small, but the flavors were delicious. It comes with 2 poached eggs, sweet potatoes, bacon, roasted poblano, caramelized onions, gouda, salsa verde and is topped with a few corn chips. Definitely a go to menu item. The other day I tried to get something more substantial and succeeded by ordering the Farmer's Market Omelet ($14). While make your own omelet was an available option, this one was filled with rosemary ham, various wild mushrooms and goat cheese. It was served with a side of good, fresh, properly ripe seasonal fruit and a choice of white or wheat toast. If you're still hungry, opt for more OJ or split the Pecan Roll. The decor of the restaurant is also very pleasing and decorated quite lavishly and comfortably. Staff was friendly and the manager recognized us on our return visit. Window seating provides great views of High St.",Ben S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2010/1/15,"Ever had a menu described to you like poetry? The staff at the Guild House have a treat for you. This trendy spot is conveniently located next to the Le Meridien hotel and in the Short North district. Started our lunch off with the Prime Rib Caps ($15) and Toast ($9). The 4 oz of prime rib was delicious. I think of the two dishes, the toast took first place. The bread was perfectly seasons and topped with avocado spread and cheese. It was hard to not down all four pieces immediately. The lunch entrees were the Chicken Roulade ($16) and the Meatloaf ($13). The Chicken Roulade was tasted like a chicken paste wrapped in a thin slice of chicken. It complemented the mash potatoes and greens on the side well. Overall felt like a light dish and didn't feel bloated after. The Meatloaf was a little heavier. There was a mix of flavored from the different seasonings, and maybe the meats, that the meatloaf consisted of. Overall liked the Chicken Roulade better. For dessert we had the Seasonal Donuts ($7). The three donuts each had a unique flavor that provided a good variety while not clashing tastes with one another. My favorite was the glazed donut. A very simple choice but it was delicious. Light and fluffy with a soft after taste of glaze. TL&DR; Great place to go out for a nice lunch or dinner. Suitable for a first date or meal out with friends. The staff had an excellent skill to describe every dish, so you will be able to imagine it before you even get it!",Nicholas A.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,5,2012/11/16,"what? Only 5 stars available?Clearly, hands down, the Finest restaurant experience I have had in 2016. 1. Later dining available. Yay! A 9pm seating that wasn't treated like ""please leave we want to go home""!2. Attentive, pleasant valet parkers - albeit expensive. My only criticism. Dining should warrant at least a discount. 3. A DJ when you walk in the door. This is amazing. A handsome, cool, dude making sure a hip vibrancy resonated through the restaurant. 4. Service. Thank you Ryland for your attentive and very personal touches. (ask him to take your pic and he includes a selfie). Fine dining without stuffiness IS possible. 5. The food, the food, the food. Ahi tuna ribbons, rib eye cap, sea bass, stuffed poblano (a little too much ""bread""inside), pork cheeks...un-be-freaking-lievable.Creative, well presented, executed, spot on.6. Price. Granted, we did not order a bottle of wine and CM is rather well known for high wine prices, but we had 3 cocktails, and 4 glasses of wine for the table and the bill was VERY reasonable for a fine dining experience at less than $100 per personUnless you prefer quiet, sedate surroundings (it is loud here) and ubiquitous food offerings, I cannot fathom anyone not loving this.",Kate F.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,4,7/26/15,"I visited The Guild House for brunch today. I definitely walked out impressed. First of all, it's a beautiful physical space. The backlit bar, the wooden structures, Persian rugs and green glass chandeliers all add to the trendy atmosphere. The Guild House is undeniably classy, but maintains a comfortable and non-stuffy kind of vibe.Their attention to detail was remarkable. This was true in regards to the service. My water and coffee were refilled frequently. The dishes and checks also came out efficiently. The waiters' uniforms, with their bow ties and suspenders, were a good look. Maybe i'll rock the bow tie and suspenders look sometime soon.  In terms of food, I ordered the farmers market omelet consisting of rosemary ham, wild mushrooms and goat cheese ($14). The mushrooms were truly the star of the dish. It was delicious, yet clean without being oily. The accompanying fruit plate was also very fresh and tasty. I have to say, Cameron Mitchell does it again. It may be a pricier restaurant, but it's worth it in my opinion. Just for service and atmosphere, you're getting your money's worth. I'll definitely be back for dinner.",Arvid Y.,,,,,,

We asked locals for a recommendation and the Guild House was at the top of the list. It did not disappoint. Being from Michigan and having a die hard U of M fan as a boyfriend I know he was looking for something to be wrong with the experience. No issues found. I would simply encourage having a reservation and be open to trying unfamiliar menu items. Sitting against the sidewalk window makes for great people watching, too!!",Donna S.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,4,2010/2/16,"I went here with a friend on a Sunday night, the place was pretty empty (Sunday night) and thus there was less staff and it was kind of slow. the aesthetics of the place was beautiful and the atmosphere was very hip and relaxed.The food we ate was phenomenal, we had the Burrata Toast, seasonal Brussels sprouts, scallops, ricotta gnochi and the honey cake. All of the food was absolutely delicious, with the scallops being extremely decadent and buttery--it was phenomenal.My only feedback (aka 4 stars) is that although its a high end restaurant, the portions (especially for their entrees) was quite small and my friend and I wasn't full after the meal despite. In addition, we wanted to get one of their special drinks but they were out :/Overall, I would say this place is a good choice for something really special.",Ryan T.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,4,2006/11/15,"I thought I'd put some time into this Guild House review. I mean it's a CMR, am I right?! Actually, I had two meals here, dinner and breakfast the next day, and I'd say they were both pretty consistently four stars.When I stopped in for dinner with my parents, the place was pretty packed, but in a fun way, and everything was completely upscale casual, so it didn't feel too stuffy. Our waiter was pretty funny but maybe not the most sociable, but that's okay, I'm their to eat, not make friends. We started off with the tuna ribbons, stuffed poblano, and pork cheeks. I really liked all three, but the stuffed poblano was really my favorite. The flavor in that pepper was awesome, and I'm not much of a shrimp person. The tuna ribbons were tasty but a very small portion, and the pork cheeks were a bit heavier than I was expecting in the tomato gravy.For the main course, my girlfriend and I had the ribeye, my mom had a prime rib cap special, and my dad went with the vegetable lasagna. Once again, all of the dishes were pretty good, but I can't say they were my absolute favorites. The ribeye is cut from the eye, and it looks more like a filet, so don't be surprised when you receive it. It was pretty thick, so only the very inside was medium rare for me. Everyone loved my dad's vegetable lasagna, which is definitely non-traditional. It comes with a mushroom based sauce rather than a red sauce and an asparagus pesto. It was very tasty.The chocolate-peanut butter torte I had for dessert was incredible as was the cheesecake. They also offer a doughnut plate, which seemed to be pretty popular based on the tables around us.BREAKFAST:This was very much the same in terms of food. None of the plates were very big, but they packed great flavor. I went with the B.E.L.T. which was probably the least favorite of the group, while my girlfriend's smoked chicken hash was awesome. I wish I had ordered that and ate most of her's. The eggs benedict was very flavorful as well. As far as pricing goes, I don't really see this place as breaking the bank. Yes, you can come here on special occasions, but it's not nearly as bad as some other high end restaurants in town, including a lot of Cameron's other places. You don't go as much in the portion size, but it's clear you're getting high-quality ingredients in some very creative ways. If you're looking to have a MEGA feast, this just ain't your place. The ambiance inside as well as the professionalism of the staff, which you'd expect at a CMR, was very welcoming. I'd highly recommend bringing someone from out of town here, since it's a very fun and sophisticated atmosphere. Cameron Mitchell did a great job with this one.",Gus W.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,5/30/17,"The Guild House is OK. The ambiance is spectacular, but that's what you pay for. Serving sizes are a joke, (you really need to have a 5-course meal to be anywhere near full). Serivce is amazing, but you can tell the staff is not being treated well by management. I've overheard some conversations from the staff, and I feel bad for them. Restrooms are in the kitchen, which seems strange for an 'upscale' restaurant.",Abby B.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,4,6/25/15,"Group of 8 celebrating an anniversary and a good friend in town. We had a great table in the back with the wrap-around couch. Highly recommend a reservation, was nearly fully booked 3 weeks out--though it didn't seem super busy when there.We lucked out in the bar and 6 bar seats were open when we came in; 20 min later it was completely packed with no standing room. Big kudos for the non-alcoholic drinks...this pregnant lady felt a little left-out until hubby pointed out ""zero proof"". Ordered the berry bramble-very refreshing and the bitters reminds you of a cocktail. The group loved the Pimms, a nice twist on the classic and a good light start to dinner...so I'm told.Hubby and I started with the Stuffed Poplano. Oh geeez, this was better than my entree. The corn, tomato gave balanced the smokiness of the pepper. So good!Dinner:Prego lady had fewer options, so scallops it was. It was a beautiful plate, but it left a little to be desired. The puree needed a little more salt and I preferred some of the preparations I've had elsewhere. The carrots didn't really seem to match scallops.Hubby went with ribeye, it appeared cooked to ordered (RARE!) and he ate it all. This isn't bone-in and at 7oz seems about right without the meat coma and sweats. Others ordered the ricotta gnocci, oysters, french onion dip, pork cheeks, more scallops and ribyeye.Then came dessert...a disappointment and actually a negative ending to dinner.I had the carrot cake, I had in my head that traditional carrot cake, esp the carrot cake from the Fish Market when CMR. Nope. Deconstructed mess. The pic doesn't even look appetizing. My favorite part of carrot cake, is actual shredded carrot, this cake had more ginger taste. The portion though small was not finished between hubby and me; just wasn't worth it.Another couple had the donuts. It appeared that we ate them, but it was actually everyone tasting them and remarking that they were not good. I know the reviews are raving about these...but these must have sat all day (or more). To the this pregnant lady with her intensified taste buds it tasted like oil...like when the oil is bad and old...and then anything you fry in it just tastes like oil. Table consensus was ""take us to krispy kreme or schneider's"". The flourless torte was reported as meh. Seriously, let's fix these desserts!All in all, I loved the decor and ambiance. Server was a bit slow, but we weren't in a hurry--seated around 7:30 and we weren't done eating until almost 11. Valet took 30 min to get our car when we left---1 valet working. They took our car with no issues, of course. Get it together! Thankfully, I went to the hotel lobby and just sat. I was joined by the others also waiting for valet.I'll try it again, but think they have a few kinks to work out. Until then, you can find me across the street at The Pearl.",Erin D.,,,,,,

From the tasteful decor to the attentive waitstaff, The Guild House is nothing short of impressive. My favorite item on the menu has to be ricotta gnocchi. The presentation is beautiful and the pasta literally melts in your mouth. Another memorable item was the flatbread crafted with a light flaky crust and the white bean puree was full of flavor.

The Guild House,269,4,3,3/23/15,"Glad I got to go! Reservation was easy to make online, and when my boyfriend and I got there, we were seated right away with no problems. We had a pretty decent meal! For appetizers we got the chips and French onion dip (it was alright, nothing special, although the dip was good), and pork cheeks with tomato gravy and spaghetti squash (tomato sauce was a bit overpowering, and the amount of pork was small even for an appetizer). For entrees, boyfriend got the lamb burger (he said it was pretty good, ordered it a medium and it was a good medium), and I got the chicken roulade. I was pretty happy with the chicken roulade. It was pretty on my plate, and had a good purÌ©e and vegetables that went with it. For dessert, we got the 3 seasonal donuts, and I am super happy about that choice. They were delicious, not too sweet, not too heavy, and the perfect way to top off the meal. Price overall was decent, our entrees were $17 and $21 each but there were certainly some more expensive options. The decor inside was beautiful, with a modern but rustic feel to it. I don't often notice the plates...but I thought they were pretty! Service was alright. Right after we ordered our appetizers, 2 waiters came by with soups and the Brussels sprouts appetizer, neither of which we ordered. We told them we didn't order either or those dishes, and they looked really confused and asked ""aren't you table 11?"" We finished our appetizers (the ones we actually ordered) and then no one came around to get our orders for entrees; we had to flag our waitress down. We later received our desserts...and probably 1 min later our waitress came by with our check. We hadn't even taken 2 bites of our dessert yet and felt like we were being rushed. I'm not usually super picky about service, but it kinda threw me off here. Our waitress was super nice though, and overall our experience was pleasant.",Tiffany W.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,7/19/17,"The Guild House is one of my favorite restaurants in Columbus for one reason: the atmosphere. From the moment you walk through the large wooden doors, it hits you... this place is cool. The low-lit bar covering the entire wall could be a backdrop for a James Bond film. The rest of the restaurant is covered in reclaimed wood and bright white furniture which provides a great palette for the pops of color like the pale green chandeliers scattered across the ceiling. I'd say the menu suffers from a bit of an identity crisis, unsure of whether it wants to be hip, progressive, or classic American upscale, but it's all very enjoyable still. The cocktails also seem to rotate across a wide range of flavor profiles but one thing you can always count on is the seasonal ""cocktail for two"" which never disappoints. It's worth getting just to see how they present it. From start to finish, it's a great location for a date night or valentine's day, just be sure to book way in advance on popular holidays.",Kyle R.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,1,2003/11/17,"Had 1pm reservations on my birthday last month. We got to the restaurant a few minutes before 1, and were told, along with three other couples, that they were turning tables and it would be a few minutes. By 1:10, the other three couples had been seated. By 1:30, two other couples had walked in and been seated in front of us. The final straw came when yet another couple walked in WITHOUT reservations and were seated while we still stood in the doorway waiting. When we asked why we hadn't been seated yet, we were told by the hostess that there wasn't any particular order in which people were seated. We left at that point. Guild House has been my favorite restaurant in the Short North since it opened, but we won't be back.

The Guild House,269,4,4,2008/12/16,"Definitely a great ambiance, the appetizers we had were out of this world (tuna ribbons and pork cheeks), they were really really good.I am making this a four star because my business associate had a fish dish that he really really liked, it was a little crunchy in the right places.I had the beef and it was good but not out of this world, I think when you eat at as many restaurants and have so many steaks, you begin to measure them against each other.  The beef was cooked pretty good (med-rare), the potato bed it was sitting on was fantastic - I think I am not a fan of duck pate that was on the beef and would rather have had a butter base or something.Server Eric was phenomenal, super nice guy and very very knowledgeable about the area and the wines - he is definitely an asset to the organization.We will definitely be back, I think in this case I will focus on the seafood next time - great experience.Oh yeah - the dessert was crazy good, we had a chocolate peanut butter kind of thing, it was decadent too.",Todd C.,,,,,,

The menu needs something more substantive and basic than the pretentious.  I predict this menu will change soon in order to survive.The quality overall is good but not fantastic.  Prices are outrageous, even for the Short North.  I think the concept is to ""wow"" an out of town guest staying at the hotel (or here for a convention) with a pretty atmosphere so as to maximize the drainage on their expense account.  The dining room is really stunning with a French country, distressed wood thing.  It's really pretty but this is not a place to have a good meal.  It's a place to have a drink with a date before you walk somewhere to eat real food that doesn't irritate you.The club sandwich had too many things going on and the steak salad was good but also a mix of so many flavors as to be annoying.  Much better places to eat in this area.",Jon F.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,5,1/23/16,"I'm noticing a trend - Cameron Mitchell restaurants seem to have GREAT happy hour menus! Came here with a happy hour group last week, and was pleasantly surprised at their delicious and affordable options for happy hour deals. When I first looked at the regular menu online, I was worried that I'd walk away with a hole in my wallet as well as my stomach, but they have a ton of great specials. All of their starters and appetizers were half off, as well as their specialty cocktails and glasses of wine! This means that we got the benefit of a lovely environment, delicious food, and fantastic service for at least half the price. Our waiter told us that Gordon Ramsay had been in the month prior and instagram'd a picture of their prime rib appetizer -- it's THAT GOOD. Two of my friends got this, and they both agreed that it was absolutely delicious. I had the stuffed pepper, which was really good but the poblano was surprisingly hot (they are variable in heat so it's no one's fault). My gin cocktail was refreshing and not too sweet. I really like that their signature cocktails revolve around different kinds of liquor for the base. I tried a sip of the bourbon cocktail with grapefruit, and that was well balanced too. $10 for a cocktail is too rich for my blood, but for $5 it was a steal. We had a great time! The happy hour is from 3-6 pm, so get here early. The restaurant was starting to fill up around 6:30pm. Also, one of the nicest bathrooms I've seen if such things are important to you.

The person I was with loves lamb, and he actually brought me here just so he could eat that burger again. So I think it's safe to say that it is drool worthy.

Lots of gluten free options for the bestie too. Gnocchi dish was my favorite only 2nd to the lamb lollipops. A great place for a girls night to share all the goodies. I've never had anything here I didn't like. Love the seasonal changes of cocktails & main dishes as well. Cameron Mitchell never disappoints.,Hannah M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2011/1/15,"The Guild House is a new restaurant in the short north area. My wife and I went for dinner very late on Saturday night and we were seated relatively quickly. The waiter was very polite and professional. He suggested the oyster appetizers, which I liked very much (my wife thought they were decent, but not great). We also shared a green salad with beets and goat cheese, which was excellent! They don't have automatic bread service here, so you have to ask for it, but the bread was good (a little salty, actually). For dinner, I had the chilean sea bass, which was made in a lobster broth, with carrots, leeks, and radish. It was a small portion, but it was outstanding. My wife ordered the chicken roulade, which gave four generous portions of cylindrical looking pieces stuffed with celery root purÌ©e, romanesco, wild mushrooms, and truffles, in some sort of a reduction. I think it was equally good. The ambience of the restaurant is modern and hip. The only complaint I had was that we were seated next to a gaggle of college girls who appeared to be a bit drunk and very loud. Worse still, the girl seated right next to my wife had a voice so shrill it could shatter a few windows ;-). To be fair, they seemed nice, but just ridiculously loud. What was surprising was that with so many open seats in the restaurant we'd be seated right next to such a large party in the first place. Anyway, this is a new modern restaurant with an interesting and creative menu. It is definitely worth a repeat visit.",Ness S.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,3,5/31/16,"We were back in Columbus visiting family and decided to dine at the Guild House for our ""night for ourselves"" dinner. We throughly enjoyed our dinner but it's pretty obvious that a Cameron Mitchell restaurant is never going to take any huge chances. We started with the Tuna Ribbons which is very similar to tuna poke, minus the wonton/rice chips most places serve with it. The tune was exceptional and the sauce brought the whole dish together. Next we had the Prime Rib Cap which was my favorite dish. The prime rib was perfect and the blue cheese worked well. I went with the sea bass. I felt a bit guilty that it was from Chile with the whole ""over fished"" controversy but went ahead got it. It was just okay. I found the whole dish to be a bit salty and the lobster was really lost among the other ingredients. My partner had the pork but he found the sour apple cabbage and apricots added too much ""citrus"" and acidity. By itself the pork was good but the other items in the dish overtook the pork. We ended the meal with the cheese plate which was underwhelming. The ""house made"" crackers weren't anything special and the cheeses were pretty boring. Our sever, Audrey, was nice but didn't really seem to willing to interact with us much. The restaurant is very nice inside with the ""rustic"" meets ""chick"" style that's been the ""go to"" style for a lot of new restaurants. And I have to mention that their martinis are very expensive for the amount they give you.I was hoping Guild House would elevate the Columbus dining scene but instead it just settles in with all the other good restaurants in the city.",Steve S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2004/7/17,Very tasty food.  Best tasting food of all the Cameron Mitchell restaurants I've been to.  Our waitress was great and very pleasant.  Definitely a place to go for a nice dinner!,Mike B.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,10/28/15,"Went to Guild House during the week for a business lunch. Seated right away by a friendly and attentive hostess. The server came out some minutes later and introduced himself and the restaurant since they are less than a year old.I was not particularly impressed with the menu and didn't just want to get a sandwich or a burger.  As a table we ordered two of the prime rib tip appetizer to share 5 ways. It was nicely flavored and cooked, they even brought one medium and one med rare. I went on a limb and ordered the chicken roulade. Rolled chicken isn't usually my preference but the menu was minimalistic. This is to be expected though for a local fare farm to table place.I was slightly underwhelmed, though it did taste pretty good, I'm not sure what I was expecting. But it missed the mark for me.The service was quite good though, refills on point, waiter was knowledgeable of menu and food.Will likely return to try a different dish, see if they can't snag that 5th star from me.",John R.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,9/25/16,"The guild house has a great atmosphere and decor. All Cameron Mitchell restaurants have excellent servers that are extremely attentive and knowledgeable. I have been for brunch and lunch. I had an omelette at brunch that I thought was ok, but my friend LOVED hers. I had meatloaf for lunch that was extremely good and I recommend it! Also, for dessert we had a fall trifle that was out of this world! Perfect place for a special occasion or brunch with the girls. I recommend making a reservation!",Madison D.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,9/28/16,"The food was decent, but there were a few things that rubbed me the wrong way. I asked about an ingredient in their flatbread, and the waitress was like ""yeah, of course it has that..it'd be weird if it didn't."" I get that servers probably get asked a lot of annoying questions, but I didn't think that I was being terribly out of line for making sure that the food didn't have ingredients I couldn't eat. When I didn't finish the tomato hummus (which wasn't stellar), she again asked ""Oh, you didn't like it?"" The tone was that of ""I can't believe you didn't finish this why are you even here please go away"" rather than ""I'm genuinely concerned that this dish might not have been up to par for our restaurant."" The tuna was good and beautifully plated, and people in my party all seemed to have a decent time. I liked that it was open late, and they can accommodate large parties. I just think the service could be improved a bit.",Emily T.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2012/2/16,"We arrived for our 6:45 reservation only to be asked to sit at the bar for ""a couple minutes""  until a table opens up. We sat there, enjoying very good and reasonably priced cocktails for over 30 minutes before finally asking the host what was happening. He then sat us promptly. Our server checked in quickly and remained very attentive throughout the meal. We had two very good appetizers, the brussel sprouts and the toast with duck, brie, and honey. Our pasta entrees, however, were mediocre at best. We opted to avoid the other entrees which were quite obviously overpriced (see other reviews). The gnocchi were pillow soft and the orecchiette tasted very fresh and both were served in edible but significantly oversalted sauces. As other reviewers have mentioned the portions were very small, probably around 6oz of cooked pasta. With such inexpensive base ingredients as found in a pasta dish (gnocchi, beans, shaved carrot, roasted red pepper) the portions were wholly inadequate. Finally, the loud electronic music was deeply unpleasant and out of sync with the decor. The DJ's selections forced everyone we could see to shout to one another across their tables. Go for cocktails or appetizers if you must, but avoid any nights with a DJ and head elsewhere for your dinner.",Gabriel P.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,9/14/15,"Last week, after making reservations on Open Table for 5:00 because 6:00 was not available, we met another couple for dinner here on Saturday night.  It is a lovely space, with large windows to see onto High Street, white leather seating, and chandeliers.  Since we arrived before our friends, we sat at the bar to have a drink.  I love that Pimm's is on the drink menu because it's not commonly found.  They offer several House Cocktails and I chose the Vodka, served in a martini glass and very good.  The bartenders were young and nice enough.Our server was a sweet young lady in her 20's.  We were served bread with butter.  The bread wasn't soft, but tasted pretty good since I was hungry.  Our table shared the Pork Cheeks and Brussels Sprouts to start.  Since I don't eat pork, I only sampled the spaghetti squash from that bowl, and ate a large portion of the Brussels Sprouts, which were crispy and delicious.I had planned on the Salmon entree, but actually got that evening's special, which was Halibut served with vegetables.  Three out of four in our party had the halibut and one had the salmon.  Everyone enjoyed the entrees very much.  They have two separate ladies rooms, which is nice, since they are both single rooms.  When we left after 6:00, there were many empty tables, so of course we wondered why we couldn't get reservations at that time.It was a nice dinner and although I am not dying to go back soon, it will be an option for a special occasion.",Anna H.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,2004/2/16,"This was my first dining experience at what everyone was telling me was a fantastic new place to eat in the short north. I had visited previously for cocktails and absolutely loved it. So naturally I was excited to experience the other side of the house. But my expectations were ruined right from the start of our evening.We made reservations for 8 o'clock arrived a little bit before 8 and checked in with our hostess. We were a group of 4 and this was supposed to be a special occasion dinner. The hostess said they were running about 10 min behind, not. A if deal at all, so we naturally went to the bar to drink their fabulous cocktails...and again were not disappointed in the least. The guild houses bar and decor is where the restaurant really shines. However we were at the bar for a full 60 min before we were seated. I checked in with the hostess twice, being told that we were the next table...even though 20 min went by before we actually were sat. The final time I checked with the hostess she didn't even look at me when speaking even though I hadn't been rude at all. Checking in twice when waiting an hour past your reservation isn't uncalled for in my humble opinion. Before we were seated the manager did come and tell us that they would comp us some appetizers which was gracious and I appreciated the apology. I wish I would've gotten an apology from a hostess instead of the attitude of ""leave me alone"". My issue with being comped the appetizers is that we wouldn't have ordered appetizers...It would have been more appropriate to comp the drinks that we paid for while waiting for our table. I'll stop with the wordy review here. The ambiance and the drinks are fabulous. The food was nothing impressive. As another reviewer had stated the portions are tiny for what you pay for. I orders the prime rib which was 36 dollars and looked at most like 6 oz of meet with three tiny potatoes on the side. Again I appreciate what the acknowledgement of the wait that we had to encounter but I don't think I'll ever go back to the guild house for more than their cocktails. It's overpriced and underwhelming. Sorry Cameron, this one still needs a lot of work.",Todd K.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2008/7/17,"The food was good, but nothing spectacular or what one would expect based on the price and atmosphere.  The menu is somewhat limited and the items really don't go with the atmosphere.  The dinners were especially lacking in variety.  I actually ordered a few appetizers instead.  Many more options to choose from in the area, but I will still go back.  Perhaps only for an app and a drink at the bar.  Overall, it is a beautiful establishment.",Jay S.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,4,2007/6/15,"We made a reservation at 7:45 on a Thursday. It was packed when we got there! Not a table was open. It is a great atmosphere and draws a slightly older crowd - probably due to price point. We tried several different dishes - Cheese Plate, Brussel Sprouts, Flatbread and the Pork Cheeks. The Pork Cheeks were the best by far! The meat was super tender and the sauce was perfect. The flat bread was decent. I probably would not get it again.Our waiter was very personable and attentive. He was super helpful when recommending different dishes from what is most popular to his favorites. Overall it was a positive experience. It is great for a night out with friends or a date night.",Maria P.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,12/28/16,"My first time at the Guild House, I ordered the raw oysters, and the kale and roasted vegetable salad.

I highly recommend--I look forward to my next visit.",Katharyne S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,7/31/17,"Fabulous food, beautiful presentation, fun sophisticated modern feel, very attentive and accommodating staff.

The decor is beautiful, the service was on point, and the food was fantastic. Highly recommend the brussels sprouts and the smoked trout for starters. The cavatelli with rabbit confit was cooked well but was missing a little something. My dinner companions ordered the ribeye and both left very satisfied. Highlights of the meal were definitely the ""cocktail for two"", with a tableside porter infuser and the doughnuts for dessert - best Boston cream doughnut I've ever had!!!

The Guild House,269,4,5,12/31/16,"Great food and excellent service. The infused cocktails are pretty awesome... the port cask idea is clever and serves well on the table. I'd recommend getting several small plates, as their appetizers are excellent. We had the tuna ribbons,  prime rib cap, ricotta gnocchi, scallops and sea bass, all split between two people. The prime rib cap was my favorite. And the donut for dessert was surprisingly delicious- not too sweet.",Alison B.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,2,7/16/17,"Drinks were good. Service was decent. My main complaint was the food. I ordered a ribeye, and what I was served looked like a filet.  I ordered my steak rare, and it was served medium. Steak was also very tough.",Josh B.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2/15/16,"Honestly, if you haven't been to a Cameron Mitchell restaurant for Happy Hour, get off your a$$. These are the best deals in the city for Happy Hour, by far. The newest CM restaurant, The Guild House, is just the latest in exceptional service, food, and ambiance.So, for starters, the apps and small plates are all half off as well as specialty cocktails and wine. I had a vodka cocktail (meh) and the gin cocktail (WIN). The vodka cocktail was just not my thing. No reflection on the bartender but the gin cocktail was DELICIOUS. These are normally $10 cocktails and half off just makes everything taste better.For food, I ordered the stuffed poblano and the flatbread. The stuffed poblano had a corn bread filling, goat cheese, and shrimp. I'll eat anything with goat cheese, really. The flatbread had chorizo, bleu cheese, figs, and ricotta. It was STACKED with toppings and a delicious blend of sweet and savory. It seems like their apps were a little more health conscious. They also have a brussels sprouts app and something with quinoa. Some friends ordered these and said they were very good. Again, all half off.Anyway, solid 5 stars, of course. I mean, it might be super pricey for dinner/lunch but if you have a stellar happy hour, I'm sold. Get here.",Lisa P.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2/16/16,"This place is damn good.....damn good. Everytime I come to Columbus for business, which is at least once a quarter I come here to ear no matter what! Last time my server I believe was Nathaniel and he is such a great great server and made a great recommendation for wine and cocktails. This time I had Eric as my server, and though I did miss Nathaniel, Eric was such a great attentive server as well. Even overhearing the bartender's interactions with her customers of the night was pleasant and she remembers repeats. So far all the staff seem to be well trained and very friendly. Happy hour by the way is 3-6pm. You can read all the other reviews raving about how good this place is for happy hour and for the quality of food you can't beat it! Ok, I have tried a ton of things on the menu.Hamachi: Must get it!!! Get it now!!! This dish is so tasty to me with such a blast of flavors and well balanced that I ordered it twice and had 2 to go. The curry flavored vinaigrette that they use is a punch of flavor and goes so wel with the velvety texture of hamachiTuna ribbons: Also another good one to taste. When you get quality tuna and simply dress it with a light soy and wasabi mixture it is heavenly. Not as hot diggity good as the hamachi to me, but a solid dish. To clarify it is simple, but not simple like getting nigiri and dipping it in soy. They definitely elevated it here.Carrot ginger soup (seasonal soup): It was tasty for a carrot ginger soup. I was told that it was non GMO, gluten free, and vegan. All things that I don't really care about, but I'm sure for it being all those things it is usually tasty in that population. It was ok to me.Sea bass: Recommended by Nathaniel the first time I went here. So good also. It was such a nice balanced dish. The broth, the perfectly cooked piece of fish, and the accoutrements went so well together. Even after the fish was gone I was scooping up the broth in my spoon to get every last drop.Scallops: Gosh, another great entree that was perfectly cooked. It was towards the end of my 6 course a la carte meal so I don't think I appreciated it enough because I was getting full.Duck pate: This was a bummer because while the texture and other items that came with it were tasty they had forgot to season the pate at all. I ended up adding salt to each bite.Toast: Forgettable dish. I think this is probably the only thing that they could rotate off the menu. It was very difficult to eat because there were too many crispy elements that just couldn't stay on probably. I would describe this dish as refreshing toast. if that makes any sense. If you eat it you'd probably agree. If you haven't eaten it yet, you probably won't get it. Prime rib caps: I agree with the other reviewed here that this is also amazing dish. Never have I ever had beef done to an actual medium rare. They did just that here. Everything paired very well from the blue cheese to the sweet oniony relish/jam underneath.Chocolate torte: I've gotten this each time I've come and everytime I eat it I can't help but make stupid giddy yummy noises because I am so damn satisfied. Don't take my word for it.....just get it. Eat it. And rollover and die. Hats off to the pastry chef on this one.See you guys again at the end of March!!!!!",Kathy B.,,,,,,

Overall, good experience.",Nk C.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,1/19/15,"The layout: the space is beautiful. The furniture and finishings are gorgeous. The service: although there were a lot of employees on staff last night, our service was very spotty. Our waiter was distracted and nervous. When the food came out, the servers did not know who had what entree, and even after telling who had what item, they placed the wrong items in front of people. One server even put a salad in front of my friend (even though I ordered the salad) and walked away - literally plunked it down. My waiter even poured the wrong type of wine into my already full wine glass, and did not apologize or offer to replace the glass of wine - I had a glass of Pinot noir, and he poured a glass from our new bottle of Cabernet without even looking.The food:First course - our server recommended the smoked trout, and we ordered the bao buns. The smoked trout was more like guacamole, with few fish pieces. The bao buns were more like donuts. Don't be expecting the soft, delicate steamed buns. The condensed milk accompaniment definitely made the dish feel more like dessert than an appetizer. The raw carrot salad was nice, but very small.Second course - I had the vegetable lasagna. Nice in concept, but it was cold and lacked seasoning. The most disappointing dish at the table was the beef pasta - it was literally 6 bites.Dessert - the highlight of the meal was the sundae. The brownie and ice cream were well executed. But don't be expecting a warm dessert.Since this is the first week, I hope the kinks will be worked out, but, I wasn't as impressed as other reviewers.",Lakshmi S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,3/20/16,Such a good vibe here. They definitely have the best Bloody Mary in town. I had the smoke salmon bagel which was great!

The Guild House,269,4,4,1/31/15,"Good start!  Checked out Cam Mitchell's newest spot with another couple Thursday night.  Nice open space upon entry (as opposed to cramped welcome areas at Pearl and Marcella's across the street)!  Decor and ambiance is awesome, top notch!  Music vibes made it feel like you're in Miami but decor felt very safe.. comfortable yet luxe!  Reminded me of furnishing style like Bungalow with a bit of mod mixed in.I'm used to stellar service at his restaurants with multiple waitstaff per table. We only had one guy and he was such a dud. No personality, no smiles. Totally different than what I'm used to so that was very disappointing.  When I asked what was popular in the menu he said ""well we have only been open for 11 days so um nothing?""Vodka martini is on point! Ordered several. My friend asked for a regular Kettle One martini and she said t tasted like cucumber!!? He took it back and didn't charge.. But then when she got the same drink I had, she found a glass chard in her mouth from a chip in the glass!!!! Horrifying but luckily she didn't bleed or anything. Since our waiter was a dud and she had already sent one drink back, we didn't say anything about the glass :-( We skipped the apps and salads and desserts because we were more into boozing BUT they all had awesome sections.Our table entrees were sea bass (lobster bites awesomeness, fish like a cloud!!!) sea scallops (pretty standard but high quality) ribeye (small portion but again high quality) and lamb burger with Farro salad (AMAZING will definitely get it again!!!) Overall it was an $$$$ expensive night out but pretty happy.

The Guild House,269,4,4,2/16/15,"I had a very enjoyable first visit to the Guild House! The ambiance is wonderful - the decor is beautiful, and the atmosphere is great. The front windows are quite large and let in a lot of nice natural light. My husband and I visited for breakfast, and there were only a few other parties in there at the time. The server and hostess were both very friendly, and service was quite good.The menu covers all of the good stuff that makes up breakfast: donuts and pastries, eggs, steak, pancakes, hash, oatmeal, and create your own omelettes! You are greeted with a choice of not only coffee, but also freshly squeezed orange juice, which is very refreshing. My husband opted for the pancakes, which came out as a fluffy stack, accompanied by bacon and Ohio maple syrup. He found them quite enjoyable. I found the gluten free menu to also have a lot of great choices, but ended up with the Smoked Chicken Hash. It was wonderful... there were lots of layers of flavor, with tart, sweet, and salty tastes. An excellent dish.As others have mentioned, the portions on the entrees are not huge. For me, I found it to be perfectly sized. I tend to  end up taking home leftovers at typical restaurants. I was easily able to finish the hash and found it just right. Those who prefer larger portions might want to add on. It sounded like the staff has been hearing that feedback a lot, because our server immediately started suggesting sides when we ordered, to round it out.Great eating!",Marissa C.,,,,,,

Came here once for dinner and once for lunch. Our service for dinner was fantastic. Our service during lunch hours was pretty awful. We weren't asked if we wanted another round of drinks at all (we brought them over from the bar) and the waitress looked like a deer in headlights when we asked her to separate our bill.

The menu offers appetizers and side dishes for eaters like me, but there's not a single Vegetarian entree. I asked the chef to prepare something for me and my Vegetarian friend that would be within our dietary restrictions. And this was rather a hilarious and pitiful... They brought out Scrambled Eggs mixed with Potatoes, Carrot and Green Beans in it with a cup of White Rice on a side. No flavor, no herbs, no sauce, nothing... Plain veggies tossed in a scramble egg....I could do that by myself at home, and do it better! And I chose to eat scramble eggs for bfast and not dinner. This is supposed to be a night out at a restaurant!? OMG... This entree cost me $17.... Ridiculous!!! I mean what in the world was this chef thinking?! I also picked starters from their menu. I tried the Brussel sprouts (as they were raving about them as their best thing) and to me they were greasy and the Brussel sprouts were the minority in this dish lol... I also tried the Vegan Pumpkin Soup, which was rather flavor less.... And I asked for a Gluten Free bread as they offer that and what came out was a disappointing dry bun....",Itusia J.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2011/9/15,"So when you first step into The Guild House you'll notice the modern rustic decor, and it looks amazing! A really appealing dining atmosphere, perfect ambience for an upscale night out.After reading some previous yelpers' reviews the only knock I perceived was potentially smaller portions, solution -- order some apps! Potential concern averted and I'm sure glad we decided to thwart that matter -- thanks Yelp.. b/c those appetizers were absolutely delish!! We went with the Prime Rib Cap, truly delectable, and the Stuffed Poblano, also scrumptious though be ready for the piquant taste of the goat cheese stuffing which I found the rock shrimp to balance that flavor perfectly.For our entrÌ©es we had the Ribeye and the special for the night Lamb Cheeks. Both were exquisite and making my mouth water simply writing this review. The Ribeye is not a Texas sized steak, but packed enormous flavor; the Lamb Cheeks were unique and had a fantastic savoriness. Service was impeccable, as one might expect from any Cameron Mitchell restaurant. Cocktails from the bar were nicely prepared and creative. My only not so stellar comment/observation was the limited dessert options, we selected the donut, eh it was aight.. though that minor hiccup would not prevent an exceptional 5-star review.  I will certainly be back and continue to explore their intriguing menu.",Hua R.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2004/9/15,"Had the Chicken and Sweet potato hash and the Eggs Benedict. The chicken and salsa in the hash dish were delicious!  The potatoes themselves would've been more pleasant if they were cut smaller, but that's a minor complaint. Dish was very filling and served in a beautiful bowl. The eggs Benedict were some of the best I remember having in a long time. The brioche (made by Dan the Baker) was really what made it. Fresh squeezed OJ was delicious, coffee was watery, service was charming. Overall a lovely experience and I'd go back....but preferably on a weekend when I'm sure it's more lively (we were one of three tables there at 10am on a week day).",Doo-Dah W.,,,,,,

Exquisite menu options, wonderful wine list and green glass chandeliers to die for against rustic barn timbers were simply amazing.

The Guild House,269,4,4,1/31/15,"Dined at the latest Cameron Mitchell restaurant while the man himself was dining there as well. Saturday morning brunch with a party of 12 took a while to get our food served. I got the b.e.l.t. sandwich with fruit which was very good but overpriced. The fruit cup actually came with good fruit other than your typical melon medley. The rest of my party enjoyed their meals too but it did take a while to be served and the price point is just a tad too high for brunch fare.The decor is very trendy and rustic in the heart of the short north.",Jamie S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,9/19/16,"Nice ambience but foods is below average. I ordered lamb chops and sea bass. The lamb chops came with some Asian style fried rice which I thought is terrible. A two bit Chinese place will cook better fried rice. That's 17 bucks. I returned the sea bass because it's uncooked / raw / cold in the center. On the second attempt, the sea bass came back with a blackened flat tail piece which had to be sent back once again. This is supposed to be a $36 piece of glorious fish. Fusion usually means you can deliver great food on more than one cuisine. This chef knows not even one. Fire him.",Shree P.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,2,2007/12/16,"I am a very loyal to Cameron Mitchell restaurants in general.   The quality and consistency keeps me coming back. However, my visit to the Guild House was blatantly just bad.  First, we had a reservation for 8 and didn't get to our table until almost 8:45.  The place was just slammed busy for a Monday night and while we waited for our table, we went to the bar.  They had one bartender working for the whole restaurant and bar.   One bartender simply is not enough.   This guy was working as hard and fast as he could and just couldn't keep up.    The food was good, but the portions were small.  The scallop entree was fine.  4 medium sized scallops for almost $30?   The prime cap steak app was two tiny pieces of meet. (I ordered it because I saw someone order it at the bar and it looked really good and theirs had 3 nice sized pieces).  Not sure if I got the last one, but it was literally less than half the amount of meat that the other one I saw had.   Also had the Brussels sprouts which were good. Again, the food quality was good/great overall; however the quantity and value was a complete rip-off.   Service:  I already mentioned that we were 45 minutes late to get a table.  The one, overworked bartender took about 20 minutes to get to us to take our drink order.  You would think the manager would at least apologize and maybe comp us a drink for waiting 45 minutes, but we never even got a ""we're sorry.""   The waiter was nice, but new and clearly not experienced.  We had a bottle of wine with dinner and he never once poured us wine even through he would stop by and clearly see our glasses were empty.  I don't mind pouring my own wine, but when you are dropping $100 for a bottle of wine and he is getting a $20 tip for unscrewing the cap, then I expect you should pour the wine when our glasses are empty.  Overall, not a place I would recommend at this point.  They need some significant management and training improvement.   Maybe Cameron Mitchell gets a hall pass for being a local favorite, but I am honest in my assessment.  This place is way overpriced for the quantity of the food and the poor service we experienced.   Your better off sticking to Cameron's other restaurants until he gets things fixed here.   I also heard his new steak house was not too good either(but I haven't been there yet).   I hope his new restaurants can be as good as his older ones, because from what I am seeing things just aren't as good as his previous restaurants.",Brian F.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2005/3/16,"I went here for two special occasions, new years eve and my birthday, and Guild House did not disappoint! The chorizo flatbread was a crispy, flaky, flavor explosion that I got both times. The oysters are also amazing and come with seasonal toppings which was unique and delicious. The menu may seem daunting if you're not used to eating outside the box (beef cheek, rabbit, skate) but just trust Cameron Mitchell and you'll be pleased. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is that the second time I went it was loud and crowded and we couldn't hear ourselves or our waitress, who was ditzy and not attentive. I usually expect better service from CM restaurants.",Betsy C.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2/14/16,"We had high expectations for guild house for our Valentine's Day dinner. Maybe too high. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but maybe too pricey for what we got. Service was friendly and atmosphere very rustic and funky. The cocktail for two was very different though could have gotten more for $20. Had the poblano and oyster appetizers. Both very good but pricey for about $15 each. I also found the main entree lobster pasta portion on the small side. Food wise I think we were most disappointed with dessert. The cappuccino came but without any sugar. The house special ice cream Sunday was trying too hard. The granita just didn't fit with the chocolate ice cream and whipped cream. The cake was also a bit dry. Overall, food was good. Could have had 10 more of those oysters. Price a bit too high and was looking for a bit more with the dessert.

The Guild House,269,4,5,8/26/15,"My husband and I celebrated my birthday at the Guild House recently.  The interior designers did an INCREDIBLE job building the ambiance in the restaurant.  It is so beautiful and chic. I felt like I was dining in New York or Miami not Ohio. The exposed wood coupled with the unique china and lighting worked!The back of the house (cooks) need to whip the front of the house (wait staff) in shape.  The food was PERFECT.  Our service left a LOT to be desired.  I am not going to waste space blasting our slow, terrible service... I'll just use the next few lines to share what I enjoyed eating:- Trust me, get the prime rib caps as an appetizer!! - I am a cheese monger and thought the cheese plate was pretty good (especially paired with wine)- Stuffed Poblanos = out of this worldI ordered the lamb burger for dinner and was a little disappointed.  I love lamb and have probably been spoiled with the lamb burger at a favorite St. Louis restaurant (Niche).  It lacked flavor and could have used some Mediterranean spices. Overall:  I can't wait to go back.  Give yourself plenty of time to dine and drink.",Sarah J.,,,,,,

But I'm all about second chances, so I'll update this if they redeem themselves next time.I was disappointed with the overall experience; from the very moment I made a reservation to the point that we left the restaurant. - tried to make a reservation for 7, and they told me that it would be hard to get a seat. That it's easier if I had a party of 6 or 8. Wtf?! - 4 from my party arrived a few minutes before the rest of us, but still on time for our reservation. They refused to seat us until our full party arrived. That seemed fine until they seated half of a party of 13. Not 12 or 14...but 13. - service was slow but it was busy so we understood and chatted up the night anyways. However, our server was practically non-existent. We were there a total of 3 hours because it took so long to do anything (bring drinks, take order, bring check, etc).- the food wasn't bad. The drinks were delicious though. I'll definitely be getting a cocktail when I go back. - the atmosphere is nice. I love the interior design and open space. Not too loud at all if you're on a date or business dinner. Like I said, I'll update my review when I give it a second chance. But for now, meh.",Kelly B.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,5/24/15,"TRULY deserving of 5 stars. Plop Guild house in any of the worlds greatest cities and or civilizations and it would receive five stars. In typically Cameron Mitchell fashion, the food was innovative and delicious (appropriately priced as well), splendid service. Oh, and BRAVO to the rustic farm/restoration hardware interior design. I mean, WOW. They had me drooling at the coffee cups! And those BEAMS!!! I am in love. Wait until you see the bathrooms. Not to reveal too much, but the ladies room has stainless steel changing tables. Drop the mic. I went for breakfast. The menu is small, but mighty, my friends. The chicken hash is out of this world. A psychedelic blending of flavors, including chicken, bacon, perfectly poached eggs, and sweet potato. Revolutionary. In fact, the entire seasonal menu is sublime. The egg and toast is Not just an egg and toast. The farmers omelet is not just a farmers omelet. Everything on thisMenu makes you realize all  your culinary experiences until this point have been a lie. And this is, lucky for you, the next first day of your life. Their fruit juice is all fresh. We had a complimentary tasting of the carrot ginger juice. Talk about a sprightly pick me up.

The Guild House,269,4,3,2001/9/17,"As much as it pains me to leave a 3 out of 5 stars  for The Guild (which I might add used to be my top two fav places to go when downtown. Hyde Park being the other) it would honestly be given 1 star if it had not been for the amazing Decor that I love so much!  The ambience in the space is so earthy a little edgy and says I'm here for a relaxed sophisticated meal!!!  Romantic and sensual The Guild was always my favorite place to unwind.  They have a truly innovative array of craft cocktails that would appeal to even the snobbiest of libation connoisseurs!  That is where the positive experience ended I am afraid.  I had planned an overnight spa experience for my husband and myself with the adjoining Le Meriden next door so my reservation had been made months prior.  So I was immediately disappointed to see that they sat us in the center of the bar area, amongst singles and louder patrons having a good time, but decided to make the best of it and try something new.  I might add this was the fist time I had sat in the bar area , we usually sit in the main dining area where you have a warm fireplace and great views from the Large windows and it is definitely a more romantic vibe.  Next came the cocktails which I would rate a 10 along with a bottle of wine, the selection was good but not great and so we settled on a bottle of the higher caliber and it was very much to our liking.  The bread was that of a blue cheese and green olive variety but I have to say the cheese was so pungent that we decided to pass and order the toast as well as the oysters.  The toast sounded delectable on the menu but left little to be desired by the eye or the pallet once brought to the table.  Oysters were small and I believe to be west coast and were decently fresh and prepared nicely.  My husband chose a dinner version of the lamb chops with rice and I the sea bass.  Both meals were inedible!  The lamb was cooked to a hard tasteless plank   And the sea bass was done in the same fashion, I ordered a flaky delicate fish and what I got was a gristly , rubbery bubble!  Our only sustenance of the evening was the delicate yet slightly over salted broth with my meal and the overly soy laden rice from his.  All in all not the experience was had waited months for.  Do not know if I would try again, tho I will miss the beautiful mix of rustic and  only slightly feminine decor!",Carisa C.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,8/15/15,"My wife and I decided to try out a Cameron Mitchell restaurant we hadn't dined at before for our wedding anniversary and stopped in fairly early on a Saturday evening. The atmosphere is great. The restaurant is open and feels much bigger than it really is. The menu is very small and focused, which was expected, however I wasn't overly impressed with many of the options. My dish felt very small for the price, and wasn't quite what I expected. That being said, it was well cooked, and very enjoyable. The service seemed to be a little lacking. When we walked in (at about 5 PM) there were 3 other tables in restaurant and 4 people at the bar. Quite frankly, there were more servers and staff than customers at that point. Even so, it took several minutes for anyone to greet us at our table. After ordering our drinks (which came quickly) and appetizer, we didn't see our server again until long after we had finished our app. I had to flag him down and then stop him at our table after he started to walk off with our app plate in order to get our entrees ordered. It didn't bother me that much as we were out for a relaxing dinner and weren't looking to be rushed, but when there is next to no one there, there's no reason for something like this to happen. With all the other options in the area, it's a decent choice but I don't know that we will be back any time soon.",Drew Z.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,10/26/15,"We were at a loss as to where to have my 50th birthday party - then a friend suggested the Guild so we went to check it out. Our waiter Hamid and the manager Amberlea treated us like rock stars. Even though it was going to be only a small birthday party, they gave us the full treatment, recommending and sampling appetizers and helping us pick the wines. They printed an awesome menu for the day of, which helped us to not only have a fine dining experience, but also to meet our budget target. The night of the event was awesome, food was incredible (don't miss the flatbread or the brussel sprouts) and the venue is just awesome, rustic and contemporary. They have a lovely small back room, seats about 10, for private events. Our friends enjoyed the food as much as they equally enjoyed the specialty drinks at the bar. We loved the Guild so much that we then returned the next weekend for a smaller dinner with 3 of us. It was just as good! Cameron Mitchell hit it out of the park with this concept-and the team scores high for execution.

The tea box for hot tea actually lights up. Seems a bit over the top, but hey... I am still the kind of girl that take pictures of a hotel bathroom if it has a bidet, so I was impressed.  Though the food was well prepared and above average, I feel like it is a bit uninspired, especially for the price.

We got the food he recommended, the eggs on toast, pancakes, and farmers omelet. Everything was delicious but the ham was especially amazing. I also really liked that the eggs were poached just right. I don't think the caviar added much but it didn't detract either. The coffee (vital!) was also a step up from most places even though it was just black drip. I definitely want to come back for dinner and it would be awesome to have a downtown getaway from our kids to have dinner and a night out here, stay at the adjoining hotel, and hit it up again for breakfast. My recent trip to the polaris Marcella's briefly eroded my trust in Cameron Mitchell  But this totally restored it!Lastly I'm dying to try the doughnuts.",Morgan M.,,,,,,

I do not like the frosted bathroom doors that can show silhouettes  of people on the potty. I do not like the cheap burning candles that smoked the walls with soot. Now for the food. We started with the smoked trout and toast. The flavor was amazing but the appetizer needed better plating. I think  having the trout on a bed of micro herbs would have been better than potting the delicious spread. I am pretty sure the delicious lasagna my friend ordered was plated incorrectly.  A veggie lasagna with bright spring flavors did not need a badly done Madeira reduction sauce. I realized the sauce was meant for the chicken roulade when I re-read the menu. I ordered the chicken roulade. It was beautifully plated and looked delicious.  Sadly, my first bite of the mushrooms and carrots was a disgusting bite of pure salt.  I couldn't hide the look of horror after my first bite. When my waitress asked how was the food, i immediately told her about my extremely salty carrots. They fixed my dish by bringing a small ramekin of bland carrots when they should have fixed the entire dish. I am sure my eyes blazed with disapproval at their fix for my $16 plate of 3 oz chicken. My chicken was dry and mealy; I almost choked when I tried to gamely swallow the meat and whatever concoction they stuffed it with. I honestly thought I would choke to death at the Guild House. The celery root puree and bits of romanesca was the only redeeming quality to a poorly executed dish. Would I go here for the food again? Most likely not.",Kim D.,,,,,,

Very efficient and fun to interact with even with the storm of people they were tending to. We were so glad to be served by a Cameron Mitchell institution, Dave, who introduced us to some of his regulars. The cocktail menu was easy to read and all of the drinks we tried were superb. They brought us complimentary kettle chips along with dip. Quite possibly the best chips I have ever had in my life. My girlfriend described the chips as bites of heaven. We couldn't wrap our heads around how the chips were so thin, crisp, and light.

The Guild House,269,4,5,3/24/15,"Is there ever a Cameron Mitchell restaurant that isn't awesome? Tried out the new addition to the Short North, The Guild House, and I don't think I have one bad thing to say. Everyone who worked there was super nice-from the friendly hostesses to our waitress and other waitstaff to the manager. I recommend reservations-my boyfriend & I went last night on a Monday night for our anniversary, and it was packed! We were seated at a table near the bar, but it didn't feel like I was close to a bar. The restaurant is broken into sections with big panes of glass & mirrors everywhere. It's like an upscale modern rustic feel-a dressed up farm-to-table experience. For drinks my boyfriend and I split the Cocktail for Two which came in an awesome container-hard to describe-but allows the drink to meld with fresh oranges and cinnamon. SO good, do yourself a favor and get this! Our waitress said it was her favorite. The bread they bring you was addictive and made with quinoa and sesame seeds with fresh butter. We split the carrot salad which was as beautiful as it was delicious. I got the Salmon and it probably was the best salmon I've ever had. It was seared golden brown and crispy and just flaked apart and melted in your mouth. My boyfriend got the pork chops and he loved them. Nice portion size too-we cleaned our plates but didn't feel sick and gluttonous. For dessert, the trifle. So perfect. Layers of chiffon cake, lemon curd, mango mousse, and pomegranate gelee. Not to sweet though, just perfect. I got hot tea and they had the coolest tea selection I've ever seen! So if you're a tea drinker definitely check it out. We had a wonderful experience, so glad we came here for our anniversary dinner. Definitely will be back. It's a nice restaurant, but with a great atmosphere. I don't think you could go wrong with anything on their menu & can't wait to try more. *Valet parking $8 (can be misleading when you see the sign for Le Meridian hotel valet $30).",Chloe R.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,4/22/15,"This restaurant was amazing...  What else can you expect from Cameron Mitchell...  We started off with the Pork cheeks appetizer which was delicious and quite large.  It could easily pass as a main dish, so just a warning to you all hungry folks!  We had the lamb burger with the kale salad as well as their vegetarian lasagna, which was the best vegetarian lasagna I've ever had, very light but the portion is really big.  I really hope I make it back again real soon...",Farid S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2006/8/15,"It's a beautiful restaurant and the atmosphere is great. We came here for graduation dinner and celebrated with friends. The food was delicious, however, the portion is too small and overpriced in my opinion. This place is definitely Quality over quantity, so if you want to feel full at the end of the dinner, you will probably need to spend $$$. Otherwise, this restaurant might not be what you are looking for.Also, the Guild House is a dressy restaurant, at least for guys many of them were wearing suits and ties. Make sure you are proper dressed before you come here, otherwise you will feel underdressed.The Guild House is a nice restaurant but I don't think I will come back again because its so overpriced.",Aileen C.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,1/28/15,"Ambiance at the guild house is fantastic. Great furnishings and atmosphere; overall a really beautiful interior.Service - My group of 4 went to dinner on a Tuesday night. The place was busy, but not packed. There was no one waiting for a table when we got there. We had reservations at 7:30 and arrived on time. When we got there we were told our table was not yet ready. The hostess did insist on taking our drink order as we stood in the entryway which I thought was odd. We ended being seated 15 mins after our reservation time. Our waiter was very nice and attentive, but as others said a lot of that staff looked very nervous and almost afraid to make a mistake. This lead to some awkward interactions. it took us two hours from the time we sat down until we paid, which i feel is a little long. Some of the delay falls on the wait staff, but the kitchen and bar as well.  I think a lot of this will get ironed out over time.Food - We got the stuffed poblano and cheese plate as appetizers both were delicious and priced well for the quality and portion size. For entrees our table ordered the chicken roulade and the pork. The chicken roulade was phenomenal and a much better dish than the pork in our tables opinion. It was very flavorful and soooooooooo tender! Entree portions were quite small for the prices they are charging, was fairly disappointed in that. Ordered the torte for desert and it was amazing.Some dishes were great, while others were just average. I think some of the kinks around the service will get ironed out as the staff gets more experience. Due to the price vs portion size I will most likely choose one of the other high end offerings that Columbus has in the future. I would give it a try for yourself though as others were much more impressed than I was. Cheers!",Joe F.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2007/11/15,"This was my first visit to a Cameron Mitchell restaurant and I really enjoyed it.    The atmosphere is very lovely.  Our server and all other employees were very nice.  The bathrooms very clean and set up nice.We got to try a lot of food most was very good.  We had Brussels sprouts, the cap city steak appetizer, lamb chops,  toast, pate, stuffed pablano for starters.  For our main courses we had ribeye, salmon, pancakes, and steak and eggs.  I didn't try the pancakes,  but the they said they were good.  I didn't eat the the steak and eggs but the steak was sliced and a perfect medium rare and the scrambled eggs looked fluffy plus it came with these delightful little golden fingerling potatoes that were cut in wedges and coated in an onion seasoning and I will want to order a side of those next time.  I had the salmon and highly recommend this dish.  Salmon was done perfect served on top of a cauliflower caviar creme sauce and nicely complimented by the unique veggie blend that was so good!  My other half got the ribeye and this was the only hiccup in our experience due to the steak coming on the very rare side but was supposed to be medium rare.  He sent it back and ate his veggies which were good.  They brought the steak back which they very nicely replated, but I still felt it was rare.  We didn't send it back as we figured I could fix it for dinner.  The potato parsnip puree and reduction sauce on his plate were very good too.  So a bit bout the appetizers.....brussel sprouts were very tasty and even though I found it a bit chewy I still put them on the  top of my list.  The cap city steak with caramelized onion puree and blue cheese is awesome in flavor mmmmm, lamb chops over fried rice I didn't like the lamb chops so much but the rice was killer folks.   The toast is topped with avocado, cilantro,  ricotta cheese and another cheese I can't recall, but as simple as it sounds I found it to be one of my faves too.  Stuffed pablano pepper is good, but if you can't do spicy then this is not a good choice.  Pate was a no way for me but my guy enjoyed it.  If you like salmon you should try theirs for sure.  Really great overall experience.",Chantel C.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,9/24/16,"Loved everything about this restaurant..everything. The atmosphere is great and the decor is perfection. Our server was really friendly and very attentive (but not overly annoying attentive). The food was amazing. I have a dairy allergy and there were so many options on the menu or easy modifications. They offer a gluten free bread basket in addition to there normal bread basket if you are doing the gluten free thing. The wine list is solid and the custom cocktails were delicious. If you like seafood, I would definitely recommend the tuna ribbons, scallops and oysters! The seasonal sweet potato soup with pumpkin seeds was also a winner. We can't wait to go back and do it again. Two thumbs up!",M H.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,5/15/15,"Excellent service with mediocre food. The waiter was spot on. The tables were cleaned thoroughly. The overall atmosphere was about what you would expect of a busy bar. Avoid the scallops, you will pay 29 dollars for sadly prepared seafood and unpolished, essentially household, vegetables. The flat bread appetizer was okay, but certainly not better than many other restaurants.The oysters were good for a Midwestern restaurant, albeit still overpriced.Really upset to see another simply decent Cameron Michel. While the bar at The Guild House is entertaining, stick to attending The Mirenova for food.",Evan K.,,,,,,

The only draw back was the music playing   I did not mind it being energetic but it was all top 40   The space is way to unique for cbus to Lowe itself to not also bringing a style to the music played   Otherwise   A must try",D M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,9/13/15,"We visited the Guild House for breakfast on a Sunday morning and were less than impressed. The Eggs Benedict we okay but far from memorable. The hollandaise sauce was a gritty glob. I've never had a hollandaise like that. My wife had the Smoked Chicken Hash and after forcing herself to try to eat it she gave up halfway through. I tried a bite and would describe the dish as just horrible. The textures and flavors did not belong together. Oh and with her last sip of her first cup of coffee my wife was treated with a good helping of coffee grounds. We'll chalk this up to being a $32 lesson.",Cam M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,6/29/15,"Efficient, that's a good word.  We went for dinner on a very crowded CInco de Mayo.  They were still working out service kinks.

We enjoyed them all.Valet parking is a must since you won't find a spot in this area of the SN.Be prepared, pricing is very high and alacart.",Michael G.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2009/8/15,"We tripped across the Guild House and were attracted to it for it's gluten-free menu.  To be honest, we were traveling from out of town and envisioned this to be a 'compromise' trip but one that met my dietary restrictions. Wow!  Were we delightfully surprised.  The decor is gorgeous and the food, quite simply rocked.  We had the brussels sprouts appetizer, hubby had the lamb burger and I was bedazzled by the chicken roulade.  Dessert was equally impressive.  Our waiter was fabulous.  He was there when we needed him but not invasive, knew the menu and was very knowledgeable.  Very, very impressive.The only thing that I would possibly want to change is for them to utilize more local, organic ingredients.  We were under the impression that the Guild House was a farm-to-table concept but our waiter informed us that the chefs were rolling that back.  Given the evident talent of the kitchen staff, that is disappointing and I hope they reconsider this.  Otherwise, fab food!",Nancy F.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,3,6/16/15,"My wife and I had been trying to find some time to get into the guild house and experience first hand all the rave reviews! We made it there for our anniversary and brought along our baby daughter! If you stop reading here, the summary is that the staff were all incredible, the atmosphere was beautiful and eclectic, and the food was simple. The only thing that really put a damper on our evening was that the valet service that the restaurant uses damaged our car and is denying liability. Anyway, back to the restaurant. Being inside the Joseph, the new boutique hotel, the decor was perfectly eclectic and fit the hotel and neighborhood.  The atmosphere was relaxed, yet refined. All of the staff that we met, were wonderful people. From the hostesses to our waitstaff, all were very accommodating and went out of their way to come greet us (maybe it was our cute baby). The food was obviously thought out, and the ingredients were high quality, but it just didn't impress me. I can no longer say that my lack of enthusiasm in a Columbus restaurant is because I've gotten used to superb NYC restaurants because Columbus had become a full blown food city. The food was good but simple.Anyhow, definitely a good place to check out. Just don't use the valet service, which will deny at all costs that they damaged your car.",Joshua L.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,4/21/15,Came here for lunch by myself. I loved the decor and couldn't stop staring at the beautiful green chandeliers. I had the vegetable lasagna and roasted brussels sprouts. Both were delicious. I was impressed by the beautiful presentation of the vegetable lasagna and it was equally amazing in taste! The sauce that coated the plate was some kind of balsamic reduction. The portion was generous but I did not feel stuffed after eating the whole thing. The cocktail I had was uneventful. It was a margarita type of cocktail and was bland. I should have had a glass of wine instead. All in all a great experience and I plan to come back.,Wynne W.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,1/18/15,Just got back from dinner at the Guild House it was fantastic ! We started out with the stuffed poblano. I had the salmon & my BF had the chicken remoulade.

The Guild House,269,4,4,5/31/15,"I'm so mixed about The Guild House.Like most Cameron Mitchell restaurants, the attraction is in the experience. In my opinion, it's by far and away the most beautiful restaurant in Columbus. From the exquisite green chandeliers to the assembly of different tea plates at each place setting; to the plush white couches to the fabulous wait staff - everything screams luxury. However, the food is always....OK. The drinks are strong (though pricey), but the food just isn't memorable. I can't say the same for other CM restaurants - The Pearl, for example, never disappoints - but I get the sense that they spent more money on the ambience than the menu.And you know what? That's ok. You can't have a world class meal every time you dine out. But if you don't have the ambience and the atmosphere, you might as well stay home. For The Guild House, I'd gladly get off the couch.",Megan S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,4/26/15,"I heard mixed reviews about the Guild House so we gave them a few weeks after opening to work out the kinks before giving it a shot. We went for my 30th birthday dinner on a Beautiful Saturday night and were not disappointed. Our waitress greeted us and acknowledged my birthday right off the bat. She also provided me with a customized menu that included menu items that were dairy and gluten free to accommodate my dietary restrictions and food allergies. My husband and I shared the tuna ribbons and they were fantastic. We also got an order of the lamb chops appetizer which was also incredible. We both ordered the Chilean sea bass with a lobster broth and it was absolutely incredible. Since it was my birthday they gave me a free desert, however since I do have so many dietary restrictions they brought out fresh berries for me instead. We enjoyed the food, atmosphere and the service and we will definitely be back.

The Guild House,269,4,5,2006/9/15,"This is how Cameron Mitchell does farm-to-table, I guess. I thought that the cocktail for two would be gimmicky but I ended up really enjoying the infused alcohol. It was refreshing and got better as the liquor (mescal?) infused over time. We had the vegetables with three dips. I was so pleased to have really good farm fresh veggies. So good and so fresh; and was that tempura kale?!?!? TEMPURA KALE!!!! We shared the sea bass that was in a lovely light but flavorful broth with more seasonal vegetables and the perfectly cooked ribeye topped with fois gras pate. And we shared a side of Brussels sprouts (because, really, who can resist?) that were roasted and dressed just right. The crowd was fun. A mixture of locals and hotel guests. There did not seem to be many of the ubiquitous suburbanites.The service, of course, was flawless. The food is pricey but well worth it for locally sourced ingredients prepared in a manner that celebrates them.",Berta J.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2007/2/15,"Not your typical Cameron Mitchell restaurant.  We went when it wasn't busy, great service.

The cheese plate left a little to be desired, which is sad, because who doesn't love a cheese plate?I would return, but with the Pearl across the street, that will always be my pick over the Guild House.",Nicole O.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,3/22/15,"Overall a very nice place for the Columbus restaurant scene going for a big city feel and nailed it.   The restaurant did not get a 5 star because of the wait time with a reservation made several weeks ago.  We had to wait for over 20 minutes.  Once seated, the service was excellent.  We order the trout and brussel sprout app, both were excellent and enough to share between 2 couples.  We were not finished with the trout before our entrees arrived.Between the 4 of us, we ordered the scallops, rib eye, sea bass, and gnocchi.  We tasted all the entrees and couldn't decide which was the best.  All were wonderfully prepared and presented. Portions sizes were correctly done, but small for the over-sized Columbus expectations.  A bit pricey for this city, but certainly not compared to large cities.  The donut dessert was perfect to share to complete the dinner experience.A must with the dining experience is a visit to the bourbon bar at the hotel next door.We will return.",Gail G.,,,,,,

Ordered a dry martini on the rocks with blue cheese olives and believe the glass was chilled as it remained icy until it was finished.  Very good start!  The soup special was a corn chowder ...  delicious!! I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass in Lobster Broth and my side was a chilled cucumber and tomato salad.  While the fish was good, I wouldn't call it memorable as it was bland in flavor and very small (maybe 4 ounces).  The salad was cucumber ribbons and 2 cherry tomatoes split in half... Good but not something I would order again.  The carrot cake dessert was very good but the serving was also very small... 3 small bite size squares.

The food however is seriously in need of some change. If you're going to charge $16 for a burger perhaps you should give a better choice. Portions are small in comparison to their price and so is the dessert. Otherwise it's great if you want to go somewhere to impress people.,stephen w.,,,,,,

Only later did he mention in conversation that he had come in early to prep the bar for a very busy valentines day. Food was good, but I'm not sure its the best Benedict I've had. Overall I would come back for the drinks in a heartbeat and would entertain the idea of a dinner there just to see if the food is any better after breakfast. But really if that bartender is there, male, didn't catch his name, sit at the bar, he's the best. Oh!

Got drinks at the bar before our reservation, and bartenders were fun and helpful picking out drinks.  Even though it's more of an upscale place, the staff was very down to earth and nice, and answered any questions I had about anything.We got the prime rib caps, the soup of the day (red pepper), the stuffed poblano, and the hubby got the steak, I got the pork.  Multiple items were described to me as well balanced and I can definitely say that's true - to really enjoy the food, especially the main dishes, you have to get a little bit of each element in your bite. Separate they're good, but together they're awesome. Dessert was also fantastic, we got the chocolate torte and the lemon cheesecake. Torte was especially fantastic, but both were good because they weren't too sweet and not too large either. Whole meal was well-plated and came out surprisingly fast.

I had a long day all I wanted was a nice dinner. Inside I was upset and grossed out but I kept my mouth shut so I wouldn't do the same to my gf. I waited to after we left to gross her out lol. I had to say something so the next day I go back and ask to speak to the manager. Natalie looked genuinely upset and told me she would call their pest control person immediately. I live in nyc it's not the first time  I've seen a rodent in public or in a restaurant. I know it happens I just don't want to see it happen nobody does. This place gets 4 stars because I enjoyed the food and drinks, the decor makes the meal very comfortable and relaxed, our waitress was exceptional and the manager did not try to skirt the issue when I brought it up or make excuses. She owned it and handled it professionally.",Peter R.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,1,6/25/15,"The quantity and quality is rather inconsistent. The steak is entirely too small for the price, when you can go right down the street to forno for a 28oz steak for the same price, better quality, and 3 x as big. Portions are extremely small. The pablano pepper appetizer is never the same size although it is very tasty. I've had the pork cheeks a dozen times and the past two times it's been saturated in the tomato gravy and that's basically all you can taste. Gross. The drinks are overpriced for the tiny amount of Booz put in them (I've watched them behind the bar) but at least they taste unique and have good balancing flavors. The staff looks hand picked from an Abercrombie catalog.

The Guild House,269,4,2,6/20/16,Sub Par for a Mitchells Restaurant. Very small plate portions which would be okay with me if they stated that somewhere on the menu but they don't.

We started with the pork cheek appetizer and I can say with confidence that I have not tasted a Sauce that good since my Grandmother's. I had the chicken roulade and my boyfriend had the pork. It was all perfect! And in regards to portion size...you are coming here for quality over quantity. The food is very rich and it's just enough to be full....not completely over stuffed - Anyone who says otherwise should just go to Olive Garden. Overall great experience.

My pancakes were soaked in grease, did not taste good, and we're totally unadorned (no fruit, no compote, no garnish).   This was a total departure from Cameron Mitchell's signature excellent service and delicious, creative food. I have always been thrilled by Mitchell's restaurant. The Guild House?

The ambiance is also unique and beautiful with the oversized vases and rugs. Not sure if it is advertised, but the happy hour options are fantastic!",G G.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2010/11/15,"Scallops were possible the best I've ever had (not that i order them frequently). Our server (whose name I sadly did not ever catch) described multiple dishes poetically (yes, others have said this too-it's accurate!) and yet did not oversell anything. Both times I've been here, everything has been solidly seasonal and excellent.",Lauren G.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,11/27/15,We had 5:00 reservations. Went there for Thanksgiving and had the private room and the service was very slow.  We were told they were out of turkey and then we were served turkey I think.  It was very bad tasting. The salad tasted like it had dirt in it and I only say this because I thought so and didn't say a word to anyone at our table and 2 other people told me it tasted like dirt.  I don't think anyone finished the salad. We all felt it was overpriced as well.,Michael G.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,10/17/15,"Each food item selected from the menu from start to finish was excellent. The Smoke Trout appetizer was served in a small jar. Alongside the Trout was avocado and capers. It was served with toast points. My entree was Chicken Roulade. The chicken melted in my mouth. Dessert was the Torte. I would order each item again. I was very disappointed in the service. The server apologized for some things. First he said he'd bring bread; he never did. I asked the server who brought appetizers. Our server said he would pace our food and we just began eating our appetizers and our entrees were served. I had part of my entree boxed. It was never brought to me. On our way out of the restaurant had to track down our server. I heard ""I forgot"" a lot.",Nancy D.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2008/3/15,"Everything was perfect: the ambiance, the service, the drinks, and the food. I loved the vintage/simple/loft feeling. My server was charming and absolutely on point. I ordered the bourbon cocktail which was delicious, beautiful and strong...and $10. It's probably because NYC has ruined me, but this feels like a steal.  I had the brussels sprouts and the sea bass. Perfect. The bass was outstanding. If I'm ever in Columbus again, I'll be back.",Ariele L.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,1/24/15,"Top notch service. Great teamwork and menu knowledge.The quality and care in the food shows in a full spectrum of flavors. Absolutely delicious!Warm rustic decor and ambience.My new Columbus favorite!",Joey G.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,1,2007/2/15,"Went last night with a colleague and dropped in, have been to all the other CM restaurants and was looking forward to it.

The Guild House,269,4,4,2006/9/15,"Very nicely decorated, beautiful bar area.  We stopped in on a Saturday around happy hour, it was not too busy yet.

Can book reservations using open table app.",Megan S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2003/1/15,"My two friends and I dined at the Guild House on a Friday night. We had reservations for 8:30 PM and we're seated at 8:50 PM. The interior design and architectural elements are sophisticated and cozy. The contrast of the ""rustic chic"" design with the loud club music did not work for me, however.  I prefer a slightly more relaxing choice for dining (or at least mix it up) but maybe they change it depending on the time/day? Nevertheless...it was odd music for which to dine.We decided to try several items to share.  We had the prime rib cap, the portabello app, the stuffed poblano, veggie lasagna and sea bass. Overall, we enjoyed all. They each had complex flavors and balanced levels of seasonings. The portions were on the small side compared to what has become an expectation for diners, but I felt the portions were appropriate.  They were carefully prepared, so I was okay with paying a premium for it.We followed up with the cheesecake (lemon and blueberries are the ultimate for me) which was perfection. I wouldn't crave going back for the apps and entrees,  but I am still obsessing about the cheesecake! The finale of our meal was awkward. The server overcharged us by $55. Luckily, my friend noticed the amount of the itemized bill before the server took it away. We brought it to the server's attention and he apologized and stated that he charged our cards to another table. But he kept taking the itemized bill from our table...which we felt was odd. And we still don't fully understand how he made such a drastic error. I'm just glad my friend was paying attention and that we had him correct it.",Shelley K.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2001/7/16,"Great atmosphere, and very accommodating to our group of five. The service was excellent (quick and friendly - even though none of us were dressed up to the standards I imagine this place would like to require). Ordered the oysters and was not disappointed. The beer selection here is great!",John M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,1,2004/5/15,"Not impressed. If you're in the area, go to The Pearl. Service was slow. The food was edible, but nothing spectacular. I'd say the one redeeming quality was the decor- very eclectic and well done. My family and I were excited to try another Cameron Mitchell restaurant since they've all been so good, but we were pretty disappointed. So many good restaurants in Columbus to go to instead.",Callie C.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,7/26/15,"Our experience here was great! I was told the place was pricey, and it is, however it is totally worth the price. Don't get me worng, its far from the most expensive restaurant in Columbus. The atmosphere is trendy and upscape, but not uncomfortable. The cocktails are crafted really well. Of course the food was exceptional. I had the skate wings and oysters, which were both outstanding. I would highly recommend this place.",Robert C.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2006/8/15,"Went there for friend's birthday last night. The place is very cozy and nicely decorated. The staff is courteous and helpful. First impression upon arriving was exceeding my expectations. Pretty good wine selection. Cannot say the same about the menu. There was only one chicken dish that I could see - Chicken Roulade. The price was reasonable I thought ($21). I asked the waiter to explain what it was and it definitely sounded intriguing, but very complicated at the same time. Since there were no other options for chicken dish, I ordered chicken roulade. Let's back up. The bread they serve with butter is EXTREMELY salty. I took a bite and put it aside, because all I could taste is salt.The presentation of my dish when it arrives was elegant, but the size for the price was VERY small considering it is an entree! As I took my first bite I realized the dish, too, was overly salty. To the point, that was all j could taste. I did not want to upset my friend, as it was her birthday and she had picked the place and hence, I said nothing to the waiter. But I did leave my written feedback upon paying my bill. I wanted to like the place, as I am always in search of nice restaurants in the area, but I highly doubt I would be dining here again. I should mention, everyone else's portions seemed to me too small, too. They did go with appetizers for the most part, but nevertheless, it was not enough food on the plate for the $$$",Lesia C.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,1/22/15,"Well,  I took my staff there expecting to give them a great experience.  However we ended up with an OK meal.1.  Once seated someone came by to pour us water and asked if we would like an appetizer.  (They never introduced themselves or gave a a second to look at menu).2.  Then he came back to take our order. (it was our waiter).  Who knew?  never an introduction just awkward dialogue and order taking.3.  I order Veggie Lasagna.  It arrived luke-warm at best and had a heavy brown sauce on the side that was too rich in flavor and did not compliment the Lasagna.The Veggie Lasagna lacked flavor.4.  Another at the table ordered the MEatloaf.  Again the strong flavor of the BBQ sauce over powered the great tasting meatloaf.  She replied I wouldn't order it again.5.  the 3rd  person at the table order the squash soup.  this was more like a thick wallpaper paste.  The server said be careful the bowl is extremely hot, well the bowl was not hot and soup was colder than the bowl.  6.  We paid 100.00 for 2 glasses of house wine,1 gin drink . 2 appetizers, meatloaf and lasagna and our bill was 100.00.I loved the atmosphere.Not sure I would go back though.  i eat out almost everyday for dinner.  I know good food and this was not it.",Doug H.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,5/28/15,"My new favorite restaurant in Columbus. Wow I was here on business with a vendor and we both loved this place. We sat at the bar because it was just two of us and tables had a wait. The staff made the experience so memorable. They were true experts of the liquor and made drinks the way they are supposed to be served originally. Our meals were fabulous including the hot pepper appetizer. I had the fish seasonal special as my entree and would get this again though tempted to try something new as much as I enjoyed it. I just had so much fun here. Props to great service, food and overall dining experience. I never give 5 stars though they deserve it. Keep up the good work. I cannot wait to go back.",Cecilia C.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2011/2/15,"This is a beautiful restaurant. We only had coffee and cake, but the place looks promising. They need to pay attention to their wait staff, however. How many times must you ask for sweetener before the server actually brings it? Our server was way more interested in watching the football game.",Rick S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2/19/15,"I want to preface this review by saying that I am a huge Cameron Mitchell fan.  I regularly dine at their restaurants and nine times out of ten, have a lovely meal and experience.  This time, though, the experience wasn't what I had come to expect from CM.I came here with my husband the day before Valentine's Day.  I knew that we were taking a risk going to a newer restaurant on a busy weekend.  But now that we have kids, we are lucky to get out of the house once a month (babysitters make a lot more than I used to back in the dark ages of the 1990's).  The restaurant was slammed that night.  We had a 9:30 reservation and arrived at the restaurant at 9:25 PM.  We were told that they were running behind.  I asked them to level with me and tell me how long and they said at least 30 minutes.  Was I pleased?  No, but it's Valentine's weekend (and I'm not going to be that a-hole that gets snippy with the hostess who had no control over the situation).  So we just said OK and decided to get a drink before dinner.  The bar was so packed that there were people spilling into the lobby with their drinks.  We then went to the new hotel, which is connected, and decided to have drinks there.  Our table was finally ready a little after 10 PM.  Our server came to the table quickly and got us water immediately, and took our drink order: A glass of rose for me and scotch on the rocks for my husband.  20 minutes later, we got our drinks.  We ordered food immediately as we had a lot of time to peruse the menu: I had the tuna ribbons to start and the scallops for dinner.  30 minutes after ordering we received our appetizers.  The tuna ribbons were lovely.  Simple, beautifully presented, and delicious.  Our dinner arrived just before 11 PM, about 90 minutes after our reservation time.  The dinner was lovely and delicious, but I wasn't really full after eating only four scallops (that's what the scallop dish comes with: four scallops).  Overal, the food was good, but I didn't feel like the restaurant was necessarily ready for prime time that weekend.  The bar and kitchen were both slammed. a fact made more apparent due to the fact that the restrooms are neat the kitchen and it was pretty easy to see that they were frantic in there that night.  I suppose that my main impression of the restaurant is this: It's very trendy. It's in the Short North, attached to a  brand new boutique hotel, with very on trend decor, and was definitely a place where people were going to be ""seen"" that night.  The food was very pretty and was delicious, but I was still hungry when I left.  As for the service, our server was really nice, but I think that when there is a situation where the kitchen and bar as slammed, you need front of the house staff to be more attentive to your guests.I plan to come back to this restaurant at a less busy time in about 6 months.  I'm hoping that I'll be able to give it one or two more stars at that point.  Until then, I'll keep dining at my other favorite CM restaurants.",Kate Q.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,7/21/15,"The Guild House might just be the crown jewel in Cameron Mitchell's collection. A recent addition to the Short North in the same building as the Le Meridien hotel, the restaurant offers some more daring fare than most of Mitchell's crowd pleasing restaurants. Now don't get me wrong, you shouldn't expect anything of the cutting edge of culinary arts here but you are more likely to find something that you won't find elsewhere in the city. For example, I had chicken roulade with celery root purÌ©e and sliced truffles. And by the way, they don't skimp on the truffles. It was fantastic. My date and I also ordered the ""cocktail for two"" which was some kind of infused tequila margarita on the rocks. It came in a modern looking circular decanter. We honestly didn't want to pour it at first because it looked so nice. Fortunately the server took care of that for us. The ice for the cocktail had also come from one of those large ice blocks that they chiseled smaller pieces off of. A nice touch. The drink itself was delicious too.The atmosphere is the blend of rustic and contemporary that you see at a number of places, but they do it very well. It feels fancier and more cohesive than you often find with that decor. At the same time, you wouldn't feel too out of place if you strolled in wearing something a bit more casual after waking around the Short North. Overall, The Guild House is a must visit even for those who don't typically frequent Mitchell's restaurants.",Alex B.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,7/19/15,"Not a bad place, but overpriced for what it is, relatively to its Short North and German Village competition. Food was decent as should be expected, but portions were weak.  The ribeye was probably not the best selection considering it's not a true steakhouse. Seasonal doughnut dessert offering was a fun touch to the menu. The decor however is BEAUTIFUL and uniquely chic which helps make the experience special. Cocktail for Two presentation is also great!  Would like to try breakfast here, as maybe that is a specialty void that Guild House could fill for the area. And for dinner I'd go back, once I've knocked out everything else on my downtown list.",Katherine M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,7/18/15,"Our server was slow with our first round of drinks and my G.Goose Martini was not dirty as ordered and, even more insulting, watered down. Ugh.

The Guild House,269,4,4,4/21/15,Great space and decor.  Great non alcoholic drinks loved the citrus bramble.  The salad I had (lunch entree salad) well I have honestly had better from Trader Joes.  Really disappointed.  Trying again tomorrow...would love to love this place.,Tammy P.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2002/3/15,"Really spectacular decor - well spaced out, design was beautiful, and tables and energy was charming and elegant. Food was good - the small plates were well priced but the entrees were somewhat small. I wish there was also a better small salad option to add to dinner. The beef pasta was delicious but incredibly rich - hard to eat almost, still delicious but again, wished I had a side salad option. The dessert was good - the carrot cake bites were kind of disappointing in presentation, the chocolate torte was great, but the cookies left something to be desired. I would definitely be back and hope they tweak the menu a bit. They will find their groove - the space is spectacular and the food is almost there!",Marc S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,1/17/15,"Lovely new Cameron Mitchell offering in the Short North. We dined there the second night the restaurant opened for business and had a great meal. The ambiance and decor (rustic chic) were delightful. The service was attentive but not intrusive. We had several appetizers: the raw tuna ribbons (good), the Brussels sprouts (excellent) and the Bao Buns (okay). The scallops were tasty but slightly rubbery, the kielbasa was delicious, very garlicky and homemade. Our dining companions had the salmon and ribeye and seemed very pleased. Drinks were excellent. This place will only get better. We'll be back for sure.",Seth A.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,5/26/15,"Cameron Mitchell has done it again. Delicious food, great atmosphere and impeccable service. The entire experience was relaxed and enjoyable.

I highly recommend the torte, donuts, and carrot cake! Their speciality cocktails are stupendous! So much so that I came back the next morning for bloody Mary's and breakfast! Bloody Mary was the best I've ever had, the eggs on toast hit the spot and chicken hash was incredible! We can't wait to come back for dinner! Service was on point - very well trained staff.",Masana N.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,1,2009/6/15,"Decor is amazing.  Meatloaf is amazing but by far the most below average food.  When you're serving $5 boxed potatoes and smear 3 tablespoon on the plate, that's underwhelming and a waste. Cameron Mitchell has a lot of making up to me. The Pearl was worse than that.",Danielle S.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,2002/11/15,"I dined at CM's newest restaurant last weekend. So many great things to say about it, the atmosphere is gorgeous, great playlist, good drink/wine selection, and the food was well prepared. My friend and I split the tuna ribbons, kale quinoa salad, and a pasta dish, along with two desserts (donuts and trifle). Highly recommend the salad. I took off one star because were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation and then it took me waving someone down to get water and drink service about another 10 minutes later. I much prefer quality to quantity, but the dishes are somewhat on the small size for the price. Overall great experience and would definitely return.",S. M.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,2,1/18/16,"What a disappointment. I was so excited to try this place. My boyfriend took me for brunch for my birthday and we had a really bad experience. First our waiter was terrible. Not friendly at all. It was uncomfortable. We were expecting the best service. Not the case. We ordered a tuna appetizer and it was SO small. I understand this is an expensive place and that's typically the case, but I could have eaten that in one bite. However, it was delicious. But our server.... Wow. I had asked him how the steak and eggs were. His response, "" Have you ever had eggs?"" I said, ""Yes."" He said, "" Have you ever had steak?"" I said, ""Yes I have."" His reply, "" Well there you go. It's the same thing."" Are you kidding me?! Way to sell me on it. I understand that it's steak and eggs, but be descriptive or recommend something more popular to me. When our food came, he just dropped it off and said, "" Here you go."" He walked away and we had no silverware. He was nowhere in sight for over 5 minutes. We had to get another waiter to bring us napkins and silverware. At the end of the meal he had asked us if we wanted any dessert and listed some desserts. I said that we were gluten free and if they had any options for us. He said, "" Oh guess you can't have anything."" Just bad delivery. I had also ordered hot tea. He brings it out just a bag in a cup which was fine..... Until I look over at another table that's being presented this wooden lit up case of all these different teas to choose from and it was very impressive. We were wishing we had that service. I don't see an immediate need to return here. I can buy an expensive steak somewhere else. But maybe I'll come back at some point in hopes of a better experience.",Hanna N.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,4,1/28/15,Loved the decor.  Rustic chic.  We ordered different items and shared them.  Lots of great vegetarian and healthy options.   Server did a good job recommending items.,Russ H.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,4,6/16/15,"Would give it 4.5 if I could.The kitchen may be the best in the city.  We split the flatbread and home-made chips for an appetizer - both were excellent.My wife and daughter had the veggie lasagna, which they both enjoyed.  I tried a bite, not something I would order, but a unique and creative approach to a veggie lasagna that brings a deep, complex flavor.I had the Ribeye - best steak and accompaniment I have had in a very long time.My daughter had the trifle for desert - wonderful.  My wife has the chocolate tort - also wonderful.The ambiance is fantastic.  The only criticisms I have are:Our server seemed to be in the weeds all night and, while efficient, was rushed and displayed zero hospitality.The craft cocktail list is lacking.  The bartenders were friendly and attentive, but for this type of establishment should have superior mixologist skills, which I didn't see.As I read this review I think I sound I bit like a snob, but hey, at a place like this that shows they have the capability of delivering a true five star experience, I really want to experience it in every aspect of my visit.We will definitely be back.",C G.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,3,2007/9/15,"A friend and I went for the happy hour and had three starters under ""market""/appetizers. First of all - nice selection of bearable wines by the glass. Unfortunately, while the food was decent, it was nothing as special as the descriptions. The Grilled Portabello under the heading ""Market""  had almost no mushroom in it - I think I counted 5 small slices in an otherwise enormous serving. The lamb chops appetizer had a very weak marinade, and since nobody asked me how I wanted the lamb, it came overdone (partly my fault for not saying anything , but medium is what I would have said if asked - not well done and flavorless.) The rice below the lamb chops was plentiful, seasoned okay but too overwhelmingly salty. So.....I'm going to give it another shot sometime and try actual dinner entrees. And hope for food that matches the lovely MÌ©doc I was drinking.",Nelson H.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2002/5/15,"Oh man. I wish I could fly here every weekend just to experience the Tuna Ribbons. I dined by myself and absolutely loved it. I had the Tuna Ribbon appetizer and the Brussels Sprouts but was very full by the time I was done... Which is odd considering they were small, appetizer portions. However the bread is so good I had two servings! (Well, I guess I know why I'm full ;) ) The bread is served with 3 small multi-grain slices that have the perfect amount of sea salt that makes you crave more. The flavor on the tuna ribbon was just fantastic. So fresh and the perfect amount of soy that didn't cover up the freshness.  The Brussels Sprouts were wonderful however not life changing. Definitely save room for dessert; I did something I normally don't do and ordered what the waitress (who was wonderful, her name was Sammi, ask for her!) recommended instead of my go-to chocolate option. I had the trife which is a mango fresh fluffy cloud sent from heaven. Excellent job to the 12 chefs that put this menu together!! Great ambiance as well. I love the hip music paired with the warm yet modern ambiance. A+ !!",Michelle A.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,2/24/15,"This place is amazing! I went for lunch this afternoon with a friend and we both enjoyed every second of it.  The food is great, but our bartender Keith was fantastic. Very knowledgable and friendly. He went out of his way countless time to make sure we were having a great dining experience. I would recommend eating at the bar. We learned all of these little details that go into the food and cocktails. Like the custom ice they use for their bloody Mary's!!! The attention to detail in this place is what makes it so amazing. I order the lamb burger and it was delicious. Great lunch item at a solid price point.

The Guild House,269,4,3,3/15/15,"This place is a lot of hype!  The atmosphere is awesome! Decor is amazing and waiter are dressed to impress.  Ok enough about that.. The food is pretty tasty but a little overrated!  Everyone liked what they got but no one was talking about it after.  The lamb chops were tasty, the salmon was good, but small portions and a heavy price!  Vegetarian options were there and good but not memorable.  As for dessert, we got a few because we were honestly still hungry from dinner. The chocolate torte was great, if you love peanut butter, the carrot cake was very tasty.. I would get this again.  Others in my group really liked the trifle as well.  There are so many great restaurants out in cbus and I probably won't go back to this one for awhile",willma g.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2002/5/16,"Overpriced and underwhelming. Food was just okay. Portions are quite small. Three of our group ordered the ribeye steak. It was a small thick piece of meat that was inconsistently tough. If you don't serve steak with a steak knife, it should be easy to cut. Brussels sprout starter was lacking in flavor. Skate was very good. The sides that come with the entrees are extremely small, more of a garnish than a side. Cocktails were pricey, but delicious.  Definitely a happening place. Noise level quite high. Food just wasn't up to Cameron Mitchell's standards. Valet parking is $10, you can pay on your phone but then it is $15 plus a service charge.",Jeanne E.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,1,6/14/15,"This is a great restaurant with great starters and cocktail.  However, if you're dropping several hundred dollars on dinner you should not have to wait OVER AN HOUR the valet to get your car.  Only response from management was its a busy night and that the valet is not associated with the restaurant.   It's right in front so you think they might have an interest.  Hopefully they realize this and improve the situation.  They proceeded to talk with the valet which was appreciated however we waited another half  hour so obviously it did no good whatsoever.",Kevin M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2/26/15,"Had dinner here last night, it was our first visit. Overall, our experience was just okay.DÌ©cor - rustic chic. Lots of ""repurposed"" wood, vintage looking china for bread plates, hand blown water glasses, antique green glass chandeliers, leather benches. I thought it was very pretty. Good combination of lounge and homey feeling. Something annoying - our table was uncomfortably close to the neighboring tables. When the servers were helping the other tables, they were practically leaning over ours as well. It was annoying. Menu - underwhelmed. I'm not totally sure what I expected, I definitely get their farm to table idea with what's listed, but it seemed like a small selection with expensive prices. Sides are ordered a la carte. When we asked our server for suggestions, he was very helpful, but specifically mentioned how several dishes were small portions and wouldn't be a full meal for him. We had also heard about the small portions from someone who had dined here a few weeks ago. Food - it came out insanely fast. Like 10 minutes after ordering. It was hot and fresh, but we felt totally rushed. Aside from that, it was delicious. I had the lamb burger with a side of French fries, my boyfriend had the chicken roulade and brussel sprouts. We are big fans of Cameron Mitchell restaurants, so we're glad we got to check it out. Not sure we'll be back any time soon though.",Kim H.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,6/19/16,"OK, My prior review was stellar but I was there last night and I've got to say that when you have a $400+ bill for 6 people for dinner, no one should arrive home looking for food but that's what happened after my son dined on the $35.00 rib eye, which was about 1.5 inches thick but about 2.5 inches around with not one other thing on the plate.  That was the same for all the dishes.  Gnocchi,--large dish but small inner bowl of food.  Veggie lasagna - that and nothing more.  Three of us had the evenings special Copper Head salmon and it was very good and at least filled us up.  The bread for six was 6 tiny pieces of ok bread but nothing special.  When we saw how small the main courses were, we immediately ordered additional appetizers, but that should not have needed to happen.  Oh, almost forgot that we were celebrating a birthday but nothing special offered here for the celebrant.  So one desert was ordered - carrot cake, which at other Mitchell restaurants is superb.  Here...you get 3 TINY, TINY pieces.  OK, but no, won't do that again. Best thing was the drinks.  The decor here is still super cool but I won't be back after this experience.",S G.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,5/16/15,"My husband and I were staying at the Le Meridian for a wedding and wanted to grab a bite for lunch. We went to the Guild House, which basically is in the hotel, at around 2 pm. The place was pretty empty except for the bar area, where we sat in a booth. He ordered the Rum house cocktail and I got a glass of white wine. The white wine was good but I ended up drinking half of his rum cocktail, which was better, so we ordered a second one to share. We also ordered the Brussel sprouts appetizer, which is Brussel sprouts with a a mustard dressing. We ordered the sea bass croquette, which came with a salad that complemented the croquettes. Finally, and because we liked the appetizer and croquette so much, we got the flatbread with zucchini to take up to the room. All of the food was excellent, the service was great and we were very happy we went there for lunch. If we ever are back in Columbus, I would go back to Guild House for dinner.",Stefanie M.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2003/3/15,"The Guild House is worth a visit just to sit in its bold, elegant space. Really, it is a great atmosphere. The food just did not live up to my expectations. The menu gives the impression that they tried a little too hard to be quirky and made unusual pairings of ingredients. While I applaud the effort to do something new, the taste just didn't hit the mark. I got an appetizer of pork cheeks that came with a tomato sauce on top. The sauce really got in the way of that delicious pork! I wish they had not dressed it up so much. My entree was the kielbasa. There was cheese stuffed in it! That really turned me off and it did not taste good. My bf and I got the cocktail for 2 which was really fun - it comes in a glass porthole and you turn it to pour the cocktail. The drink was great. Overall, I won't be going back anytime soon but I do recommend a visit if you have not been to see for yourself.",Anna T.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,8/28/15,"I'm pretty sure this place is what white suburban middle-aged women fantasize about when they have wet dreams. It's a Cameron Mitchell spot, so that automatically means the menu is inflated more than the Russian Ruble during communist times. Warning to the wise: don't come hungry (unless you decided you feel like hitting the max on your black card), the portions are petite sized (perfect for getting you summer ready for that adorbs Kate Spade dress you're going to rock at the New Albany Country Club!!). Now with that being said the interior is attractive and they certainly paid attention to detail. I think the proper terminology is ""French Rustic"" (god I had that fucking word.. it's a nice synonym for old and shitty) but I think that might be a tab bit insulting to the French (let's be honest they are more sensitive than a pregnant lady trying to fit into jeans). I would venture to say it's more Mary Antoinette.. but instead of getting beheaded she moved to the MidWest Ohio farm fields and started calling coke, pop (seriously, why Ohio why?). The tuna ribbons are nice.. I think they call it ribbons so it seems like you're getting a present and feel better about dropping 15 bucks for 1oz of food. For brunch I recall having some kind of omelet.. Even if I wanted to I couldn't elaborate on that. It's an omelet... kinda hard to fuck up. It's like potatoes.. have you ever had bad potatoes? Of course not because if all else fails you just throw some more ketchup on those fuckers and voila! There's quite frankly nothing on this menu I can honestly say I have never seen before. As far as dranks go, I do like that they have a drink for every alcohol type.. I just wish they were better. The vodka cocktail was too lemony and sweet.. and not in the yum lemon pie kinda way.. more like a oh did some of the lemon pinsol you clean all this wood with get in my drink kinda way. The place overall is nice and the food is aesthetically pleasing. This is the kind of place that a white girl who wears a Louie purse with her yoga pants and gym shoes and thinks she's chic and bougie would find absolutely uhhh-mazing and that old white suburbanites travel alllllll the way from Dublin for! For the rest of us, it's just a nice place to stop by for a drink and get a much needed breather from the usual downtown douchery.",SR R.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,5,3/29/15,"Worth the hype! Went on a Wednesday evening with a group of friends and it was packed. Luckily, we had a reservation so we were seated right away. Our waiter, Ben, was very polite and helpful in answering questions about the menu. We had the Brussels sprouts and carrot hummus appetizers, which were both good. The lamb burger was excellent and I got the cucumbers and tomatoes as my side. It is definitely pricey, but worth the money if you're looking for a nice night out. The restaurant itself is decorated beautifully and the bar is very cool too.",Karlie B.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2002/8/15,"Went for Sunday brunch, group of 4 people and took us almost 3 hours - service was extremely slow. Ambience was cool. Majority of food was good except the brussel sprouts - not good at all so I sent them back (and I usually love brussel sprouts). Flatbread, steak & eggs, and torte were exceptional. Portions were very small for the price. Not my favorite Cameron Mitchell restaurant - probably will not go back.",Meganne P.,,,,,,

The Guild House,269,4,2,6/14/15,"Came here on Sunday for brunch and overall the food and experience was disappointing. I loved the decor. The exposed wooden beams were great. However, that's where most of the compliments end. We got the donut trio to start. They were excessively greasy. I understand it's fried dough, and probably fried to order, but the paper they were put on was completely soaked in grease and every bite wreaked of grease. I couldn't even tell it was a Heath or strawberry cheesecake donut. Our eggs on toast were missing the caviar that was described on the menu. Maybe the kitchen forgot or was out or they really only meant essence of caviar. The smoked chicken hash was pretty good, but the portion was small. Our server was too busy chatting with her friends to give guests the attention they deserved. We clocked a solid 10 mins where she was at their table gabbing while our coffee mugs ran dry. Come to work to work or just go home.",Monty B.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,3,2/13/15,"Beautiful decor-scallops and pate were great and toast served w/pate exceptional. What stood out: the wait staff and valets treated us like old friends and were very attentive! What was disappointing: the beef ravioli was dismal in presentation; seriously? Throwing ravioli into a bowl and calling it artisanal?The noise level was so high as to prevent audible conversation, especially around oversized tables. Choice of music thumping loud: please Guild, change the genre!! It doesn't work if you want customers to stay and relax over dessert (carrot and flourless cakes that were superb btw) and coffee. So much thought put into Guild's presentation, it was disappointing to end up enjoying the bar MORE at the adjoining hotel next door.",PAula Q.,,,,,,
The Guild House,269,4,2,2/14/15,"Went for lunch with my husband and toddler son on Friday afternoon. Loved the decor and the hostess was great. Our server came over to take orders, and totally sold us on the cocktails. We placed orders after asking some questions about the different menus on our table. When my husband's burger came out as just a patty with cheese on a bun, and not with lettuce, tomato, and mayo as the menu had described, he asked about it and the server responded that it was just ""the most plain burger you can get.""  She then informed us that it was the kid's menu from which he ordered the burger. The kid's menu is not labelled as such and has a breakfast and lunch section on it with some basic dishes but also some more ""adult"" dishes. When we read the menu, we assumed it was a breakfast/lunch special menu and the larger card was the regular/dinner menu.  Our biggest complaint is that our server didn't bother to mention that it was a kid's menu when my husband asked about the two burgers on the different menus and then when the burger didn't arrive as expected, she didn't attempt to correct the situation. The kid's burger was unimpressive but the rest of the meal was alright.",Jillian G.,,,,,,

The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,4,2004/1/17,"ENVIRONMENT: We had a great table in a private room because I was there with a group celebrating a friend's birthday. It was a nice setting for a group of 8.STAFF: Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu, which made me feel comfortable asking her questions.FOOD: As a whole, the food was delicious. My wife got the lamb chops, and said they were the best that she's ever had. I got the grass-fed strip steak, which came with an amazing chimichurri sauce. This was interesting because a few other people also got the strip steak and didn't specifically ask for the grass-fed version, and they didn't get the sauce. We all thought it was weird that they didnt specify that in the menu. Actually, the menu was pretty vague all around. You would have never known that my steak was going to come with that sauce unless you somehow knew to ask the wait staff. For dessert, I got the delicious chocolate cake and my wife got creme brulee and said it was good too. Also, I feel inclined to mention the sides. Our waitress gave us high hopes about the sides and they were fine, but I had really high expectations. My mashed potatoes were a little wet and my wife's mac and cheese (which was our waitress's favorite side) was just alright.",Paul D.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,5,2004/1/17,"Excellent experience through and through. My NY strip and my wife's sirloin were both juicy and flavorful, perfectly seasoned, seared, and cooked to medium rare. The shrimp De Jonghe appetizer was buttery and rich. The Caesar salad was one of the better salads I've had of late. The baked potato was a baked potato--hard to improve upon or mess up a baked potato. Drinks were top notch. I had a great Manhattan and a delicious Queens, a gin drink. Nice wine and whiskey lists. Service was excellent. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful and she offered us useful assistance describing multiple menu items. The atmosphere is very nice. It certainly doesn't feel like an old Panera. Although it's still relatively new, the decor feels timeless. I love the feel of old steakhouses and they recreated that feel masterfully.

The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,4,2009/7/16,"Last Thursday, I had an enjoyable dinner at the Avenue Steak Tavern. The Avenue is a great addition to the Grandview neighborhood. The charming restaurant is exactly how you would envision an upscale tavern in the 50s and 60s. The dark woodwork and classic red leather seats make you feel like you have stepped back in time. Besides offering a wonderful atmosphere, the Avenue also has great service. Just like all of the other Cameron Mitchell restaurants, service was outstanding. Our server was attentive to our needs, and she kept bringing us freshly hot rolls out of the oven. The only thing the Avenue could improve on is its food. The Avenue is not the best steakhouse I have ever been. The food meets expectations, but does not exceed them. As for price and quality, you do not get a lot of food for your money. I ordered the tavern salad and the Atlantic salmon. The tavern salad was absolutely delicious! There was a phenomenal sweet dressing glazed over the lettuce and beats that truly made the salad. Although I was very pleased with the salad, I was disappointed by my main entre. The Atlantic salmon was smothered in a chardonnay butter sauce which lacked flavor. I also like my salmon to be crispy, and the salmon was prepared a little too soft. Overall, I recommend this restaurant for the experience, but the restaurant needs to improve their menu.",Emily F.,,,,,,

The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,3,12/13/16,"The atmosphere is very relaxing, the service is great, the food...average. I ordered the chopped steak with Caesar salad. The salad was average at best. The dressing was okay, the croutons looked and tasted like they were from a box. I did enjoy the cheese crisps but there were at most 4 small pieces. The chopped steak was served over a wonderful sauce with plenty of mushrooms and onions. It was cooked nicely with a crisp outside and pink middle. My only complaint was it was exceptionally salty. My friend ordered the French onion soup, which was sold as ""cooked for 30 hours."" She said it was decent but nothing special.I would probably go back for the happy hour and atmosphere but I don't think I would go for dinner.",Danielle H.,,,,,,

It was very nice, upscale atmosphere (seemed weird that it was the Panera I used to go to every now and again), open and spacious, nice bar, service was okay.The food was amazing. I had to have a steak because . . . steak house and all, so I ordered the Grass-fed New York Strip which was a little fatty but good. My partner and my mother got the twin filet mignons which melted in your mouth but my dad, God love 'im, got the Ribeye which was hands down the best on the table (seriously, he cut it with a fork, delish!) The sides were great as well. Loaded baked potato and mashed potatoes too (we all traded bites of everything we ordered). Dad got a free dessert because it was his birthday but took it home and we were too full to even think of having any.It is bit pricey ($$$), but worth it for a special occasion.In all honesty I was surprised. I had heard The Avenue was ""just okay"" so we held off going for almost a year to let the place settle into itself and get its groove. We were all pleased and would recommend a visit!

The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,2,10/30/16,"Meh.It's a very nice looking restaurant and the hostess and bar staff were all very friendly.A bit lackluster on the food side although I didn't order the porterhouse that I was told (by my Uber driver) was spectacular so maybe this is all my fault.Had a lackluster salad. We have some dryish steak and frites. Some dry roast chicken. Some 'hot' chicken that wasn't necessarily spicy at all.Our waitress was friendly and meant well, but a bit amateur. After our first cocktail there was never any inquiry into if we wanted another. The empty glasses sat on the table throughout the whole meal. It became a bit of a game. There was a manager cruising the dining room but they didn't stop by our table and/or notice that there was a four top with empty glasses.Alas. Is this place new?

Our server (Michael) was super friendly and helpful. My wife and I shared the pork chop and veal entrees. The pork chop was recommended by our sever. I'm not normally a big fan but it was fabulous. The spinach salad was also excellent. We  ordered the cream of spinach and the mushrooms for sides based on our servers recommendation as well. Both sides were delicious! The only dish that I didn't much care for was the veal. It was a little too cheesy. Oh and the dinner rolls are pretty good too. I liked my Chianti very much as well.We had also ordered the oyster Rockefeller but the server forgot them. A good thing he did, because we couldn't finish our dishes.

Also ordered the fries, fried asparagus, and shrimp grilled cheese. The fries and grill cheese were awesome! Definitely get them! The fries asparagus were bland and needed some seasoning.

The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,4,2/23/16,"It's been nearly a year since I'd been to a Cameron Mitchell restaurant, so I was excited to get reservations to the newly opened Avenue. I was here on a Friday night on Valentine's weekend, so I expected it to be pretty busy anyway, and it definitely was. I'm assuming it's busy in general, so you're going to want to make reservations. We had 8 pm reservations but didn't actually get sat until around 8:30, which doesn't usually happen at a CM restaurant, but I can overlook it, since they just opened. After the wait, the service was excellent, and our server was extremely friendly and helpful.We split the Oysters Rockefeller here and loved them. The herbs mixed in with a nice buttery sauce made me wish there was more than two to an order, but it was well worth it. I had to go with the ribeye for my main course, and my girlfriend decided on the the pastrami and swiss sandwich after glowing recommendations from the server. The sandwiches come with fries, and the steaks with a choice of a Tavern or Caesar salad as well as a side. I opted for the mashed potatoes.My girlfriend ordered the Wedge salad, and it wasn't the biggest salad in the world, but it was incredibly tasty. The Tavern salad I had was decent, but the Wedge was the winner here.As far as my steak goes, it was cooked a perfect medium rare and was absolutely delicious and flavorful. I haven't had a good steak in awhile, and for the price, it was a damn good one. I wouldn't say the best I've had, but I really enjoyed it. I wasn't as big a fan of the mashed potatoes. I like a little texture to mine, but this was a creamy blend with not much to it other than butter, and I just wasn't digging it that much. I also added the peppercorn sauce for $2 (it comes on the side), and it was good, but the steak definitely doesn't need it.My steak was great, but the pastrami and swiss was amazing! They cure the pastrami in house, and it's exploding with salty deliciousness. The girlfriend loved it. I'd probably come back just to grab this, and it's not too too expensive for a CMR. Unfortunately, the shoestrong fries that came with it left a lot to be desired. They could have used some seasoning or something.Overall, I really loved the old school steakhouse vibe here with the dark woodwork and classic red leather seats. The entrees were great, but I feel like they could step it up on the side dishes. This truly is another great restaurant from Cameron Mitchell with just a few kinks to work out (There's no where for people to wait besides the bar which was WAY too crowded). I'd like to come back in a few months and have a go at some of the sandwiches on the menu, because they look amazing! If I could, I'd give this spot a 4.5 stars.",Gus W.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,3,1/17/17,"I'm a big fan of CM restaurants. They're always really pretty, with friendly and professional service, and consistently good food. And as someone with food issues, they're my go-to for when I want to feel special and not like I'm inconveniencing everyone with what I can and can't eat. That's why I'm bummed about The Avenue -- it just didn't feel special at all. It's good. It's totally fine. Nothing was wrong, but nothing was really all that great either. If I'm going to spend $100+, I'd much rather go to Hudson 29, which I think is far superior. First, I thought the atmosphere and the attitude were a bit cold and snooty. We're talking really formal service, super stiff uniforms, every woman with her hair pulled into a tight bun... it was weird and unlike what I have come to expect from CMR. We had a reservation, but we still had to wait about 20 minutes. That would have been okay if somebody had apologized to us, but the attitude was more like -- We're gracing you with our restaurant and allowing you peasants to eat here. Once we were seated, our table was janky. Like, it rocked and rotated the entire time we ate. That's totally fine at a cute little diner, but not at a CMR spot, and definitely not with the pretentious attitude everyone had. I do have to give our server loads of credit though: she was -- although formal -- helpful, fast, and attentive. When the food came out, everyone enjoyed it, but out of the four of us -- no one was wowed by it. For me, I ordered a burger and fries because they offered a gf bun that could make me feel more normal than the sad, salad-y burgers I usually have to eat at restaurants. The burger was tasty, but certainly not anywhere close to the best in the city. And I know I'm being picky here, but the gf bun wasn't even what I've come to expect from CMR. It was like the Udi's 8-pack I pick up at Kroger -- you know, the ones where you can tell two sides were attached to other buns. The fries were good, but they were exactly the ones from Hudson 29. Again, just didn't feel special or unique. Overall, The Avenue just didn't do it for me. Cameron Mitchell Restaurants have spoiled me to other locations by how down-to-earth, yet super professional the service can be and by how special they make every single experience. This place just felt average.",Bryant M.,,,,,,

The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,1,2002/5/17,"Spilling entertainment guarantee! Not for me though...At dinner, the waitress dumped our drinks on me (see attached picture, taken right after the drinks were spilled on me). I know the waitress did not do this on purpose. The waitress and a manager apologized. But it was embarrassing for me, for my wife. Not to say that I had to continue my dinner all wet (see picture). The restaurant was full, and the customers in the tables around us were encouraging us to complain loudly. They were also saying that the restaurant would give us a free dinner for spilling the drinks on me. We did not want to mount a show. After all, we were there to enjoy our dinner.To my surprise when the check arrived, the manager only gave us a $10 discount (see attached picture, where I took out the name of the waitress for her privacy) for the waitress spilling the drinks on me! I am not sure what are the standards at Cameron Mitchell's restaurants, but these are not the standards in the industry. These are not the standards at a top restaurant. These are my takeaways from this lousy behavior: (1) For the Avenue, spilling drinks on their customers only worths 10 bucks. (2) The Avenue is not customer-friendly nor professional. The Avenue is definitely not a top restaurant for Columbus nor Grandview. (3) If you want to get heard at the Avenue, you should mount a show!It was a very disappointing experience.",Javito D.,,,,,,

I love Grandview and I love the fact that there's ample parking in the lot behind Avenue.  The restaurant itself was a delight.  I first noticed the French bulldog umbrellas in the stand by the door and, frenchie fan that I am, I was already hooked.  Inside, I was expecting to see Frank Sinatra.  The Avenue gives off a fancy diner vibe with class and elegance.  The NYC-themed made me feel like I was really in the Big Apple.  I expected it to be dark but it wasn't and that was appreciated.  Even the bathrooms were exceptional.  2.  Service.  Our server was so friendly and helpful.  He was on top of his game throughout the entire meal and really made our experience top-notch.3. Drinks.  The cocktail and wine list is brilliant.  My friend and I enjoyed the Sloe Tom Collins (so tasty!) while our dates tried the Manhattan and the Bronx.  Everyone was pleased with their selections.4.  Food.  I started out with the Tavern Salad.  I am  usually not a big salad fan but this salad was incredible.  I had to forego the bleu cheese because of my milk allergy but even without it, the salad was perfect.  The vegetables were fresh and the salad dressing was the perfect addition.  I would have been happy with just a giant plate of that salad but I also opted to try their 8oz sirloin and that was delightful as well.  Mine was cooked to the perfect medium rare and the seasoning was delectable.  My steak was complimented by the mashed potatoes that come in this adorable little dish with a tiny lid.  They were delicious!  Everyone in my group loved the food.  Thank you, Avenue Steak Tavern, for making our Sunday evening dinner a success!  We will definitely be back in the future!",Erica R.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,4,7/22/17,"Met friends there last week. It was my first time there but they have been there a few times. Nice place. Relaxed atmosphere, not stuffy at all. Grandview Avenue is pretty busy in the evening so the valet was a nice touch. It was $5 to park plus tip. My friends were running late. As I waited by the front door, the person I believe to be the manager stopped by and asked if I needed anything or some water while I waited. The service was very good. The meal was also very good. I wouldn't put it up against some high-end steak places but it was very nice and I enjoyed the food.",J L.,,,,,,

The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,2,2002/5/17,"We went to a restaurant styled as a high end steak house, ordered a simple strip steak, paid a premium price and received an over cooked, dry slab of beef.   That's enough for me to be greatly disappointed.  Everything else was as expected. Excellent salad, side and dessert.   But when you bungle the entree that you tout you get panned.",Bob M.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,3,4/22/16,"I've been putting off writing this review for a while, primarily because I love *most* of Cameron Mitchell's restaurants and I really wanted this restaurant to be amazing since it's literally in my backyard. Honestly, I have one word to describe both of my visits here: underwhelming. The food is...ok and the service is good but borderline glib. On both occasions, my dinner companions seemed to enjoy their beef dishes (steaks the first time, burgers the second). Since I don't eat beef, I ordered the half chicken the first time and the hot chicken sandwich the second time. Both were dry and sadly, bland. The things I do like are the tavern salad, the French onion soup, and the fries. Unfortunately, that's not enough to keep me coming back. I realize the restaurant is still in its infancy so I may give it another chance at some point, but it likely won't be anytime soon.",Tash L.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,3,2004/10/16,"This restaurant has a lot of potential. It's in a great location in Grandview (albeit with suboptimal parking), has a really attractive menu, serves really good steak for a reasonable price, and has the Cameron Mitchell name attached to it. I actually enjoyed my 12oz ribeye steak here more than the more expensive bone-in dry aged strip steak that I had at the other Cameron Mitchell steakhouse in town, The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,With that said, this restaurant is currently not meeting its full potential. The service/execution of the food were easily the worst I've ever experienced at a Cameron Mitchell restaurant. While my steak was fantastic, everything else that my family ordered missed the mark:-My daughter's kid's white cheddar cheeseburger was served with zero cheese on it. How do you forget to put cheese on a cheeseburger?? Even McDonald's wouldn't screw that up.-My wife's crispy ""hot chicken"" biscuit sandwich was served almost cold and was not spicy at all. So I'm not sure where the ""hot"" comes from for the ""hot chicken"" as it wasn't spicy nor warm. Maybe it's just supposed to be warm but it sat out too long before it was brought to our table?  -I never received a steak knife for my steak. So I ate my steak with a butter knife. I would've asked for a steak knife, but our server didn't come back until we were done with our meal... Fortunately, my steak was so tender that I could cut it with a butter knife. But seriously guys, you're a ""steak tavern"". You can't forget to give a steak knife to someone who ordered one of your more expensive steaks! This being a relatively new restaurant, maybe they're still working some things out and will improve over time? I'd be interested in trying them out again in a few months for a second impression.",Kaoru M.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,2,2004/6/16,"A rare swing and a miss from the Cameron Mitchell folks.We've recently had some success taking our two sons to dinner with us at reasonably upscale restaurants.  Especially Cameron Mitchell restaurants since they have a decent kids menu.  However, our experience at The Avenue was substandard for two reasons.  Our expectations and the restaurant's execution.My wife had the Wedge Salad to start which is a fixture at Cameron Mitchell places and executed well, as always.  She had the ""Crispy"" Hot Chicken and Biscuit and, to put it bluntly, Hot Chicken Takeover has absolutely nothing to worry about.  She only ate two or three bites before giving up, announcing the biscuit was dry and inedible.  I had the Oysters Rockefeller which were fine.  Slightly better execution of the same dish is seen at Cameron's American Bistro (called the Oysters Bingo) as these ones had a little too much spinach.  My scallops were sort of subpar as well.  Not terrible, not great.  Just sort of there.  I had a house salad as part of my entree as well and I was struck by the appearance of just plain old lettuce in a salad.  Nobody really does that anymore, but I guess that was what was served in 50's?The bread that arrived before the meal was also dry and served with ice cold pats of butter, which essentially made them unusable.  I guess this is a throwback too, but maybe one that should just be thrown back.My youngest was bummed that the Mac and Cheese that is usually on the kids menu at most other Cameron Mitchell restaurants was missing here.In order to appease the other three members of my disappointed family, I cut short our dinner and walked down to Jeni's for dessert.For now, that might be The Avenue's best feature--its proximity to other great food.",Vin R.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,4,12/27/16,"Our second visit. As good as the first time!  The Avenue is a beautiful venue with ample parking in the rear. Enjoyed appetizers and a glass of $5 wine before diner. No need to ""sit in the bar"" like some restaurants. Our table ordered four different entrees and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. I especially like the fact that all the entree come with a choice of salad.  Enjoyed another glass of wine; still $5 because it was before 7:00 PM. Generous pours. Not like Napa in Dublin where the pours are poor. Service was fine. Why not five stars?  I guess I'm being a bit thought on them?  Four and one half would be more like it.",Bill W.,,,,,,

The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,2,2009/11/16,"Excellent service from all the staff. Ambience is nifty but lights are so low you can't see the menu or the food and the music was so loud I couldn't hear the waitress telling us about the desserts, since they don't have a printed dessert menu.Prior to my first visit to this highly touted Cameron Mitchell restaurant, i read numerous reviews here and on other sites. I'd decided to order a Caesar salad, the onion soup and the house special chopped steak in order to avoid the possibility of a tough piece of meat. The salad left a lot to be desired. While visually pleasing it lacked flavor. Too little dressing leaving the mouth feel like chilled washed romaine lettuce and the parmesan cheese was little toasted wafer like bits. The anchovies were an excellent addition.The onion soup was the best part of the evening. Literal perfection.The medium/medium rare chopped steak was dry. It had a char on it and though smothered in onions, mushrooms and a sauce, it was just too dry. I advised them it needed more fat content. The sauce and mushrooms while tasty was cold. They offered various solutions and ultimately didn't charge for the dish.Again, the staff and service were wonderful.The chocolate cake was divine.After I got home it all came flying out of me. Maybe they used tenderizer or MSG in something.I just wasn't impressed with this place.",Dee D.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,2,2007/9/17,"We popped in with no reservations at 6pm on a Saturday, July 8.  We easily got a table on the patio and enjoyed the atmosphere.  The food was great...service was poor.  We spent $206 on dinner for two.  I ordered the 8oz filet medium rare and it came out grey in the center...medium well.  I sent it back and a new steak was returned by the manager.  She gave no apology and simply said I hope this one tastes better.  No compensation, no discounted on the steak, no apology.  Cameron Mitchell prides themselves on service and this experience did not live up to that reputation.  We were constantly sitting with empty glasses before our waiter would pop by to see if we wanted another.  We never got the bread he said he was going to bring.  The manager made me feel like I was wrong about my steak being severely overcooked.  A disappointing experience when we had hoped for so much more.",Steve G.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,3,2/13/16,"I was so excited to try this new Cameron Mitchell's restaurant.  The stars of the meal were the tavern salad and the filet.  Everything else was just substandard.  The rolls were cold but did have rosemary baked in.  They were served with 2 cold butter foil packets.  As mentioned before, the tavern salad was excellent and the wedge salad was just average (I didn't care for the dressing).  The steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned very well.  The baked potato was very dry.  Thank goodness for the extra butter and sour cream!  It seemed we had to keep asking for things (felt beggish...not a word, I know, I know) rather than things you would expect to be offered in a restaurant.Overall, the place is beautiful, the prices are fine dining, and the overall experience didn't deliver for me.",Jen K.,,,,,,

The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,3,5/27/16,"I wouldn't return to dine here.  Considering the price and the quality of the cuisine, it's not worth it.  I ordered the filet and to my dismay, it was good but not excellent.  I tried my friend's flank steak (a lower price point) and I actually thought it tasted better.  The waiter recommended the hash potatoes, so we gave them a try.  They were greasy and nothing special that you couldn't find at a diner.  We commented to the waiter about this and he apologized but didn't do anything to remedy the situation.  The decor is great, it brings you back to a 60's steak house that I imagine gangsters visiting in the movies.  I like the attire of the servers as well.  They look very dapper in their bow ties and suspenders.  But as far as the food and quality of service, it didn't meet our expectations for fine dining.",Rachel C.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,5,9/25/16,"One of my favorite Cameron Mitchell's! The atmosphere is fun with the dark red leather and dark wood. It has a jazz-y feel.

The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,4,7/15/16,"New on the block from Cameron Mitchell.The design is beautiful.  Especially cool is the bathroom.   Looks like something out of 60s NYC.  Only thing missing was a bathroom attendant.  Cloth cotton hand towels a real plus.  Wow.  Thanks for the flashback.Service was exceptional, as is usual in CM properties.  Our attendant was celebrating her BD, and we had two BD in our group.  So we all toasted together.  She was well trained and exceptional on her knowledge of the menu.Food choices are all over.  $13 chicken sandwich to $40+ steaks.  You choose, thats a nice price point option range.  The onion soup is classic, very rich.  Salads are on the small size, but very tasty.  My old fashion was well done at $10.  Nice menu options overall; you can eat lite and not spend much, or really duke up the expense.  Again, your choice.I'm sure this will be a Grandview destination place.  They have a nice patio.  Parking in back and also valet.We will be a customer for sure.",Michael G.,,,,,,

The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,2,4/28/16,"Critical flaw...The ambiance was nice, sitting out on the patio on a spring night just cool enough to activate the overhead heaters. The waitress did a great job taking our orders and keeping my ""The Bronx"" cocktail filled. Speaking of the the drinks, they were top notch. ""All of these positive comments and you still only gave it two stars?..."" you might be asking yourself. Yes, I did. You have one job as a restaurant. Make quality food. In this case, The Avenue did not and it was a critical flaw that ruined the rest of the experience. When the best part of your meal was the side salad, there is a problem. The ""hot chicken"" sandwich was bland. It should have been called the orange chicken sandwich as somehow they managed to give it a healthy tangerine glow without actually making it spicy. The french fries were ok--they appeared to be highjacked from Steak and Shake.Also, my wife has a thing about butter served in tin foil. So there's that.The real problem were the scallops. I will not get too cute here and just say this. $28.00 for four undercooked, cold sea scallops...You can do better CM. You should do better for that price anyways.",Kirk D.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,5,2007/6/16,Wonderful meal from start to finish! Our waitress was amazing and helped us choose a perfect bottle of wine. Menu is very straightforward for a steakhouse - no fussiness which is nice sometimes. I had the twin filets that came with a house salad and one side you choose - I got the corn and enjoyed every bite. The chocolate cake dessert was nothing special - would definitely skip dessert next time.,Amy S.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,4,2001/4/17,"Only complaint is the ""ambiance"" lighting.  It's only 4:30 and the sun is shining outside. I can see having this for the evening but not happy hour.  Trey the bartender was AWESOME!",Robbin H.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,5,4/26/16,"Cameron Mitchell does it again!  He and his team have created yet another hip and cool spot that transports you back in time to a classic steakhouse.  Per usual no stone is left unturned which I why I like dining at the newer CM establishments, it seems they really work to create an atmosphere that's cohesive in theme but conducive for the modern day diner. My husband and I went on a double date with friends here last night and loved it.  We all got cocktails and were very pleased.  They prepare and serve them as they would have been served historically which is kind of an interesting twist.  We all got different cuts of steak, all were prepared correctly and were very delicious.  The sides were also good.  I got a blue cheese crust for my filets and it was very well executed.  Most places don't take the time to actually broil the cheese on the steak to make a true crust they just top it with the cheese and send it out.  So I was very pleased that they went the extra step. We had one diner who needed gluten free options and he was more than happy with the options on their GF menu.  It's nice to be able to take the guess work out of picking a dinner spot that has a decent GF menu!Each couple got dessert, our friends were very pleased with the creme brulee and my husband and I had the most delicious piece of chocolate cake we've ever had at a restaurant.  It was soaked in Kahlua with a fabulous chocolate ganache over top.      Service was impeccable, which I've come to expect at a CM restaurant but it shouldn't be taken for granted. Overall, good food, good service and a great vibe, definitely worth returning to.",Steph M.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,4,2006/4/16,"Started with the French onion soup it was very good but a bit thick, it had a sweet taste that was different but not so much to make it something it's not, I don't like a lot of strange plants in my salad and they were very happy to make me a wedge salad with a house dressing (golden balsamic vinegar) normally I don't care for this but it was outstanding and not tart at all. I had the NY strip it was cooked to perfection but did lack a bit of marbling but was in NO way dry, for desert I had the hot fudge Sunday the ice cream was plain maybe maybe vanilla bean would be better, the fudge tasted homemade and was excellent. I ordered a sangria it was not on the wine list but they were happy to make it for me it was ok but I think sangria has to ""age a bit"" and I wouldn't order it again. Also the bread was something that could use a little improving they are little square rolls that are a bit dense with a trace of rosemary I think a warm sourdough would be a lot better The service was outstanding, but all of the staff looked like they were on speed, please slow down its a bit disturbing to watch people move that fastAs far as the atmosphere it wants to be like  a NY steak house, but it's not I have eaten at Peter Lugers many times and there are some things you can't copy, like Lugers steak and Lombardi's pizza please turn down the Frank Sinatra music and be yourselfOver all if I had to give you a grade it would be a B and would go back Oh ya one more thing what about having prime rib",Paul R.,,,,,,

We got the Shrimp Dejonghe for a starter and French Onion Soup for starters, and they were on point.  For my main, I had to get the Steak Frites (it's a steak tavern, after all).  The skirt steak was a generous cut, cooked as I requested (medium rare), and under chimichurri and lime- yum!  The fries were thin, crispy, and plentiful.

I felt it was a Lean Cuisine of a good steakhouse.  What I loved is that you can have a side with your steak, which I loved.  But the portion size for the delicious side of mushrooms was too small.The best thing about the meal were the hash browns with a delicate scoop of sour cream.  Delicious! Hands down the best of the meal.Still, I left a steakhouse for the first time wanting more.  I left kind of hungry.We should have ordered a dessert but we didn't.

I regret the inadequate capacity of my ample stomach, in that I was not able to consume more of this restaurant's magnificent food. But I must back up...I got here early for a retirement dinner we were having for a colleague. Sat at the bar, learned the 4-6pm happy hours includes $5 glasses of wine, $5 well drinks, and $3 beers. Ask for the list. Also noted the stack of old timey cocktails they whip up in front of you. Old fashioned for one friend, sloe gin fizz esque drink for the other.Got seated in the red leather (leatherette?) booth and got a chance to see the full menu. My God, it's 1940 and the war hasn't started yet. (In the US, anyway.) Steaks, sandwiches, lobster...sides to fight over...appetizers to tempt. Go look at their website, or better yet, go there and look at the menu. I'll have to go twenty times to even begin the sample the items of interest. The specials included a New York strip steak with, and I swear they said this, ""sauce made from a Forties recipe..."" With so many fine ingredients I couldn't memorize them. Hell, I don't even remember one of them. They were all good. One diner ordered the lobster, I got a filet, we shared sides. Then the waitstaff comped us a bread pudding and ice cream dessert when coffee was served because they knew our guy was retiring.Great service. Great food. With God as my witness, I shall never know hunger again.The coffee was served in little coffee pots with cups and saucers that made me feel like I was just off the train in Santa Fe going into a Fred Harvey restaurant with the Harvey girls.

I wish I was paying more attention when he ordered because I would have steered him towards the kids filet. He was not happy when his steak came out looking like a hamburger. Woops, sorry buddy. My ribeye came out looking amazing, but was cooked a bit more medium rare than medium and just wasn't as spectacular as I hoped. I ate at The Barn a few weeks ago and much preferred the steak I had there.There also seemed to be 100 servers working. Everywhere you looked there was someone in suspenders.

We ordered a bottle of wine, which the server slammed down, resulting in a spray of red flecks on my CREAM colored suit for which she did not apologize or remark.  I ordered the supposedly amazing ""special"", seabass.  It was dry.  Dry as jerky.   I very politely sent it back and ordered a medium filet instead, which was good.

Upon entering, one should already be excited about trying a Cameron Mitchell restaurant for the first time, but the decor and, per usual, the friendly hostesses solidify it.  We sat down and ordered a drink. We were brought rolls, and this is the only part I don't understand, they were slightly colder than room temperature and you were given two cold butter pats with it. The were not pleasureable at all. i don't know if this was a mistake or if it's a New York tradition, but that was our first impression of food and it was deeply disapointing. However, things went up from there. We ordered the pecorino cheese and bread appetizer and it was phenomenal!. I would go back just for that. The wife got a wedge salad. It was good, but 1) it's not a wedge, it cut up 2) they put egg on it and 3) the bacon on it was intensely flavorful and awesome. I initially got a caesar salad and was very fishy tasting. I declined to eat it and I like anchovies. They insisted on bringing me out the house salad which was great. I didn't complain and I didn't really need a different salad but the server was great. Wife got a filet and hash brown side dish and loved it. I got a ribeye and added a lobster tail. I loved the steak, but the lobster tail was about 5 oz and kinda tough. It definitely was not worth an extra $20. I got a corn side dish and it was awesome as well.  Overall, I love Cameron Mitchell restaurants and I will go back but there were a few taste disappointments here. I'm curious if others had the same roll issues bc I want to believe it was a one time mistake. Also 4 dollar signs is not quite appropriate to rate this, it should be 3.",Andrew W.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,5,2002/9/16,"My dog has been dying to go inside every time we walk by.  He's apparently not allowed, so my wife and I figured we'd check it out and report back to him.  The restaurant has been open a week and is a very busy, well-oiled machine.  Excellent service (and the price premium) that you'd expect from a Cameron Mitchell restaurant.  The place is a throwback to the old school steakhouse, and the food was truly great.  People like to complain about Cameron Mitchell restaurants taking over Columbus, but this one brings great food and great service.  It doesn't feel at all like a corporate chain, and it will bring more volume to Grandview Ave.  Happy to have them here.  But now my dog is pissed at me...",Andy L.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,2,2/26/16,"What ever happened to the days when a $150 bill gave you a dinner you raved about? My steak was burned and tough; I wanted to send it back but nobody checked on us so unfortunately I kept it. Otherwise underwhelmed with my mashed potatoes. Was expecting something special.  Maybe this place is still too new to get it right. I don't know. But for $150 I'm not going to try again.  Go to third and Hollywood instead---it's Consistent, always excellent, and great environment.",Susan M.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,3,6/20/16,"We took my father and his wife there last night for Father's Day. I had been here twice before so I thought it'd be ok. We arrived at 6:45 or so and we were seated immediately. We received our food just before 8:00. In our section, there were three booths and a a big table empty so it wasn't packed. It seemed like a very long time to wait for the food and then of course we were late to watch the Cavs game. The server was so great. She was friendly and answered questions. The hash browns had so much potential but they were so incredibly salty! Everyone at our table commented on how salty they were, including me. My stepmother got the French onion soup and she commented that it was too salty. My sister in-law also mentioned the French fries were too salty. Overall, it was ok. The family wasn't impressed so I wouldn't bring them here again. I might try it again and get food that is less likely to be so salty. After all, it's so close to my house!",Lauren B.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,5,3/30/16,"What a wonderful addition to Grandview! The food and cocktails are excellent and a pretty decent value when compared to an a la carte steakhouse. The spicy chicken biscuit is definitely worth a try if you aren't in the mood for delicious steak. I recommend the steak tartare appetizer, the steak frites, and the corn as well. I have enjoyed everything I have had here honestly. I look forward to many a summer evening sitting on their patio enjoying their NYC burrow named cocktails.",Debra R.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,5,3/26/16,"Two friends and I had dinner here last Tuesday.  I seldom find that a restaurant lives up to its hype. In the matter of The Avenue, not only did it live up to its hype, it surpassed it.  The atmosphere was lively and loud but not so loud that you could not be easily heard by the people in your party; the trick of the acoustics was interesting. You could hear your group but not overhear neighboring tables.  This made it lively and intimate all at once. The decor is just as amazing.  You feel as if you have walked into a modern version of a 1950's steakhouse, or at least as I would imagine one looked like as I am not that old.  It is clear that corners were not cut and expect was not spared in the decoration and furnishings. The staff was superb. From the hostess to the server and everyone in between, they were friendly and made you feel welcome and helpful with any question.  They did not hover but were there when needed. Now on to the main course. The food was awesome, as in awe inspiring. From the appetizers to the dessert there was not a single misstep.  We split an order of Oysters Rockefeller and a shrimp cocktail.  The oysters were perfectly prepared and the shrimp as fresh as you could want. Next were the salads and soups. The portion sizes were just right. We had the Caesar and house salads and both were great.  The loaded potato soup was perfect. I was expecting a chunky soup but it was a smooth creamy textured soup and tasted wonderful. Everyone ordered the steak frites as their main. Wow who would have thought a skirt steak could have been cooked so well. The shoe string potatoes were the perfect accompaniment. You are given A house seasoning that you can add if desired. After trying it on one bite I desired a whole lot more.  This was an unexpected treat. You would think after eating all of this food there would be no room for dessert. You would be wrong. The bread pudding and hot fudge sundae were split among us and not a morsel was left.  After eating so much I was surprised that I did not feel stuffed to the gills. I really think The Avenue has their portion sizes down perfectly. So many places serve way too much food. Here the sizes were just enough for the particular course and left you so you could not wait to try the next creation to hit the table. I highly recommend The Avenue. I can not wait to go back and work my way through the entire menu.",Frank E.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,3,3/26/16,"I really like the vibe inside The Avenue, has sort of a speak easy way to it. I went here for my birthday and the overall opinion from the table was just ""ok"". I got the twin filets Oscar style with mushrooms and hash browns. The bÌ©arnaise sauce was super thick but good. Steak is steak, but the hash browns were under seasoned and didn't have very much of that golden crispy goodness I was craving (Waffle House has way better). Mushrooms were really good though. My friend ordered the chop steak and said it was like an under seasoned giant hamburger and she regretted ordering it. All of the desserts were good, but not anything to brag about.",Christina M.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,2,2004/2/16,"We tried this place for the first time tonight and were greatly looking forward to it. We've eaten at most of Cameron Mitchell's restaurants and after the departure of Ruth's Chris from Columbus thought this could fill the void. I will say the atmosphere is quite nice and the staff/service was very friendly. My major issue is that they serve choice cuts of meat instead of prime (except for the filet mignons). I could taste the difference in my New York strip and when I asked the waitress she confirmed it. In my mind, for the price, all of the cuts should be prime. This place is positioning itself as a high end steak house and selling the same cuts of meat you would find at an outback or an Applebee's. I'd sooner buy a prime steak from market district or go somewhere else.",Logan S.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,5,2002/12/16,"Reservation was made online...two weeks before the official opening on Feb 1st. They were confirmed. Let me tell you...this is one incredible place...from the valet parking attendants to the hostess to our unbelievably attentive server Derrick...OMG! HEAVEN! It was our wedding anniversary, and I had forgotten that I had indicated that when I made the reservation. Well..Derrick knew...I was blown away. Inside, the atmosphere is woodsy and I love the contrast of the dark wood panel walls with red leather booths and chairs. Awesome music too! They need a piano player and saloon singer, lol...but there would be no place to put them. The service here is better than any of the other Cameron Mitchell restaurants...perhaps because it has been open less than two weeks. Everything is sharp...and the food is beyond excellent. We started with the Baked cheese fondue, and Shrimp Cocktail...entrees were New York Strip w/Lobster Tails...Colorado Lamb Chops...New York strip again...sides were as perfect as the entrees. Our deserts...creme brulees were out of this world, and were each decorated with a little chocolate circle with 'Happy Anniversary' written in white chocolate. How can you top that?I highly recommend a visit. We're ready to make a reservation for a special birthday next month. Great job guys! It was a pleasure being there this evening.",Char C.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,5,2002/10/16,"First off, we were there tonight and in no way does this seem like a restaurant that has been open 10 days. Everything was top notch, but, Cameron Mitchell clearly does not open until everything is readySince this was our first visit, my friend and I tried everything from soup, salad entree sides and desert. we love fine steak houses and this was among the best.  Our server Scott was personable, knowledgable, always there when you needed and not there when you didn't.  French Onion soup excellent, as was the filet, hash browns and creamed spinach. great menu. I truly wish I could offer some sort of constructive criticism but cannot as I would not change a thing.

There was a little too much dressing on the salad, but otherwise everything was perfect.

The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,4,2003/3/16,"The Avenue Steak Tavern is exactly what it sounds like. A neighborhood place featuring basic meat dishes set in a classic, simple dÌ©cor with a busy, open kitchen and floor plan.Like nearly all Cameron Mitchell restaurants, the ""concept"" is king and the phony New York-style black & white photos (a la The Palm), the server's red suspenders, and the bogus signage all try to get your attention away from the lack of real patina or authenticity. It's all about franchising the concept for expansion. Nothing wrong with that, but like the tacky t-shirts that the servers wear at Marcella's with mob-style mottos like ""Fuggetaboutit"" printed on them, it takes away from the experience in my opinion.We arrived on time for our 8:00 reservation to find a busy waiting area and delays of up to 40 minutes for confirmed reservations. After 20 minutes we nearly left but I was offered a free drink to hang around, so we waited and were seated about at about 8:35. I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, the well-oiled CM machine should have better control over the table flow, but it was handled well by the staff and service was quick once we were seated.As we were waiting, we noticed that the wines were stored in an open glass vault facing Grandview Avenue and the morning sun. I hope they change inventory quickly, as this will ruin good wine quickly.After being seated we were greeted immediately and drinks were brought out quickly. Like lots of places these days, they feature trumped up ""big city"" cocktails. We had wine by the glass (a nice selection and many under $10), so I can't comment on the fancy drinks. My $6 glass of Malbec was excellent.The bread arrived shortly thereafter but I didn't know what to make of it. They were soft, sweet buns with a pad of butter in a foil wrap. Just one small bun each. Kind of diner-like and not real impressive.The menu is short and features the unadorned 1960s style basics- steaks, chops, seafood, potatoes, salads and few desserts. You could say ""classic"" or you could say, ""dated."" Up to you. We thought this focus made sense, as nearly everyone we saw was ordering steaks.We started with the shrimp cocktail, which was mid-sized (not the giants you find at Hyde Park) but was perfectly prepared with a small pile of horseradish sitting on top of the cocktail sauce to mix in if you like.This was followed by a wedge salad, which oddly, was not a wedge at all. It was a tiny pile of iceberg, chopped egg, bacon and tomato with very little dressing. It was very fresh and tasty, but skimpy and too small to split. Nothing like the actual wedge cut from a head of lettuce like Morton's or Ruth's Chris.We ordered a NY strip and the large filet, both medium rare. The open kitchen allows you to see the super hot broilers they use to cook the steaks. This is my preferred method, vs. grilling, pan-frying or a flat top, as it sears the meat quickly and holds the juices in.They arrived at the table sizzling and were both spot on, temperature-wise. The meat is obviously high quality (I read that they source it from Michael's) and was super tender. Not huge cuts, but thick and satisfying. There is nothing worse than spending $40 on a single piece of meat and having it botched.The baked potato and asparagus sides were uninspiring.We skipped dessert and our tab was $138 including tax. Not cheap, but fair. This is less a corner tavern and more of a special night out place.The experience is almost exactly what I expected- fake trappings, good service and well-prepared food. With all of the innovation in the Columbus food scene, I'd rather spend my money exploring, so I don't expect to back here soon, but I can recommend it.",Cmh S.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,4,2004/1/16,"Me and my boyfriend went here last night for dinner for the first time.  I got the special punch drink with rum in it (I forget what it's called.)  It was tasty and made right. ;)  For dinner my boyfriend got the special, which was a New York strip with a special sauce on the side, a wedge salad and a baked potato.  The steak was cooked PERFECTLY.  He likes his steaks medium well and that seems hard to attain at most places.  They either overcook it or under cook it.  They did it perfect at The Avenue.  He said it was one of the best steaks he's ever had.  The wedge salad was different than any wedge I've ever seen, but it was really good.  Had a 1,000 Island type of dressing on it, eggs, bacon, tomatoes and was chopped up... not in the shape of the typical wedge salad.  I had the caesar salad.  It was alright... nothing to write home about.  For my meal I got the hot chicken biscuit with fries.  The fries were great and I really liked the sandwich too.  Was definitely spicy!  They were PACKED... which we expected.  We made reservations.  When we got there, the only table they had available for us was a small high top table in the bar area, so we opted to wait for a real table.  It was only about 10 minutes and they seated us.  All in all, it was a good experience.  The server was nice.  We will definitely go back!",Shannon M.,,,,,,

The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,3,2006/7/16,"Ambiance was nice.  Steak was very good as was the service.  Ceasar salad was made with old lettuce and over-dressed, from a bottle.  The worst was the bread service.  Grocery store quality.  I'm not typically a big carb eater so when I go to a nice restaurant, I have a little (treat) bread which should be high quality (first impression).  Ironically,  the next night I happened to eat at another (Martini) CM restaurant, and the same thing happened!  Horrible, tasteless bread!  Cameron, cut costs somewhere else.  Everyone deserves a second chance but when my friends ask (yes, I'm a foodie so they do) I'm honest.  These things are easily remedied, but leave a lasting impression.",Jane C.,,,,,,
The Avenue Steak Tavern,93,3.5,3,2005/8/16,"Often times our best qualities, in their extreme, are our greatest weakness. And so it goes with Cameron's service model. Sat at the bar on date night recently, but decided against dinner because we couldn't carry on a cohesive conversation. With zero meaning being ignored and ten as perfectly attentive, the bartender was a 15. The tasty mushrooms and oysters Rockefeller appetizers were damn near perfect. Just wish we could've enjoyed them without the monologue on George Washington's proclivity for rum from Barbados and unsolicited interruptions.",Steve M.,,,,,,

We ordered the shrimp appetizer that was basically shrimp scampi. The sauce the shrimp came in was Good, however, the shrimp were SO over cooked, they tasted like rubber. I ordered the 8 oz Filet Oscar style. My steak was very over cooked. I ordered it medium rare and it was slightly over medium. My plate was filled with blood and made the sauce that comes with the Oscar taste watered down and gross. This is the first ever review I have written on Yelp. I decided to review bc if you are going to charge $50 for a filet Oscar, it better be good.... And it just wasn't! Disappointed!!",Maria G.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,12/30/17,"We went for a belated anniversary dinner, and had a great time. I ate what was by far the best scallop of my life -- a single golden scallop with a smoky, buttery flavor I'd never tasted before. The Bourbon Hemingway was absolutely delicious. Our steaks were very good, though my filet was just a touch on the dry side. My wife's ribeye had a fantastic char on it, though.The service was polite and attentive, although I felt our server was perhaps a bit new, and brought more enthusiasm to the description of the dishes than was necessary.Overall we really enjoyed the experience, and would gladly go back for a future special occasion.

Well the Barn was on a list that my girlfriend and I made up for places we want to try.  I made a reservation on a Saturday night for 7:45 seating. We were greeted promptly by the host and she grabbed menus and gave us to another host for him to show us the way to our table, but not without first saying ""Happy Birthday"" to me. Our server was Austin and he did a extraordinary job!! I even started a talk thread for the best recent service because of our experience. Austin has been working at the barn for a couple of years and it shows, he knows the menu inside and out. Ask for Austin when dining at The Barn. The three of us ordered salads to start off, my girlfriend with the spinach salad, my dad with the house and I ordered the Caesar. The salads were all good and a nice way to start off the night. For our main course each of us ordered a steak- My girlfriend and dad both ordered the Twin Filets both getting 1 bacon wrapped and 1 brie topped with a baked potato as the side. I ordered the 14oz prime ribeye and Austin suggested it medium, which is more done then I like it, but he gave an explanation as to why to order medium and not my typical medium rare. The ribeye was delicious, it was melt in my mouth tender with a perfectly crust and served with housemade steak sauce and my choice of side which also was a baked potato. Being a CMR I knew dessert was going to be on the house, so I ordered a slice of coconut cake and it was delicious, nice and moist and creamy. The three of us had a great night at The Barn and I will definitely check it out for brunch with my meetup group.",Bill E.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,12/27/16,"My husband and I came here to celebrate our marriage. We had reservations and were instantly greeted as we walked in the door, everyone was professional. The decor was beautiful. Our server, Keith, was absolutely amazing. He was able to make suggestions on both food and drink items- checking to make sure our bloody Mary's tasted the way we wanted. I ordered the shaved prime rib sandwich and was concerned about the bread being too hard for my braces. He offered au jus to soften it up, it was perfect! My family was thoroughly satisfied with their meal. Overall I'd rate it a 4.2, but factoring the price for the meal compared to the amount of food given: 3.7. This is not a cheap place to take your date.In the back they have a special section for (cigar) smokers.",Rebekah M.,,,,,,

The price tag is a little high, but don't let it scare you. You get what you pay for here, and it's SO worth it. Get the filet .. Oscar style :)",Tara L.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,5/21/17,"This place is very unique. The inside of the restaurant was set up awesome, I love the decor. Valet parking is free which is also nice. This place gets busy! We made a reservation for 6 on a Friday and the place was packed. It took a coupleMinutes to get our seats. The drink list centers around bourbon but there are other choices if that isn't your thing. Two people in my party got the bourbon samplers and really enjoyed that. I had the tea bourbon drink, forget what it's actually called, and it was really good. I will also say this place is great with kids. As soon as we sat down I ordered a baked potato for my daughter and hey brought it out right away, so nice! I had the lobster bisque to start and it was okay. It tasted like a typical lobster bisque. For my meal I had the scallops and they were just okay. They cooked them perfectly for sure but for me the flavors were lacking. 2 of my dining mates got the filet and were in love with it. To them this review would be 5 stars, they couldn't get over how good the steak was. I tried it and thought it was good. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing I don't know? Overall this place is pricey....for me if I am going to pay this much for dinner I would like it to at least somewhat blow me away! I might come back at some point and give that steak a try!",Kate F.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,6/29/17,"Been to this place before and used to like it a lot. Last time front desk gave us attitude and wouldn't seat outside when there were free tables. Sat us instead inside next to two loud tables with 10 guests and 6 guests . The haughty host proceeded to give us menus without giving the wine list. We sat for 10 minutes without a waiter appearing. I went to get a wine list myself to make a choice to be ready when the waiter would appear. Got a wine list myself by getting up and asking a passing server. That didnt ring any warning bells for them. We sat waiting another 5 minutes without a waiter ever coming, we decided they just aren't giving even decent service. Not going back there when it's busy that's for sure. The manager enthusiastically asked us how our dinner was on our way out. Wow. Wasn't in the mood to be mad or sit and wait anymore or give them any money or time. Dont bother going Wednesday night or when it's busy until the staff changes.",Peter G.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,2009/7/17,"We love Cameron Mitchell places. For your money, you will get more than most places. We have really high expectations  and usually we leave happy. That being said, between atmosphere, service and food, food is the weakest link here and it's not that bad at all. The atmosphere is that of a barn and like a sip of good bourbon; warm, caramel and inviting.  The service and management are wonderful people who care. Now, to our food. My wife ordered steak oscar which had little lobster pieces on top....but fishy juice was all over the steak..not good. I had a prime rib that was aged, but the fat was rancid in spots. I know meats. I know aging and it's an understandable mistake. The management called me later and made it right!  No kitchen is perfect, but how they reacted was professional and I'm sure the food will be right on when we go back.",Andrew W.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,11/29/17,"We went to the Barn to celebrate our anniversary and as soon as we walked past the hostess stand we knew we made a mistake, especially when she called (yelled) our name.  The atmosphere was not what we had expected, especially considering the menu.  It was loud and fast paced, service personal moving quickly from table to table and we were seated in the back next to the restroom and service station which made it worse.  This is not the place for a small celebration but would be fine for a large group party.  We decided to celebrate here because we at in the bar a few weeks prior and the feeling was cozy and intimate, which naturally we thought would translate to the rest of the restaurant.  The food that we had in the bar was delicious, a burger and a shaved prime sandwich.  The servings were ample and everything tasted great.  Not so much in the dining room.  We ordered the oysters (we did discuss it for a bit since we are in Ohio) but figured if it was on the menu in a CM restaurant they would do it good.  Not so much, the oysters were practically non existent and gritty.  The other issue was our main meal, for the prices of the steak dinners two sides should come with the meal.  At any steak house the choices should be carb and veg not one or the other, this is the first time we have encountered this and were very disappointed in the presentation.  Our server brought us a delicious piece of cake for our anniversary which was nice and appreciated.Kind of a disappointment on many levels, however we will go back and eat in the bar again.",Celia C.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,7/18/16,"On 7/18/16, me and a group of folks from work went for one of my coworker's birthday dinner.  I made reservations online about a week ago, and when we arrived tonight I was pleasantly surprised that we were placed in a private little room to accommodate us without even asking for it.  This was awesome!  Claire was our server and she was wonderful; when advised that it was one of group's birthday, the guest in question was told she would receive a free dessert.I'll try to go over everyone's orders, but I might miss one or two things, so apologies.  My fiancee had the Bourbon Apple Punch, while one of our group tried the Bourbon Hemingway along with a Bud Light.  Obviously everyone knows what they are getting with a Bud Light, but my friend seemed to enjoy the Hemingway, and my fiancee enjoyed the Apple Punch so much she ended up having two.For apps all we ordered was the calamari, which was delightful again (not overly greasy as my first review mentioned, perfectly done and I love the horseradish aioli).  One of our group ordered the Goat Cheese Ravioli, which she didn't really enjoy too much.  I didn't get a taste so I can't really say what was wrong or wasn't wrong with it, but the Barn was nice enough to comp the person who ordered it upon seeing she didn't enjoy it.As far as entrees go, two folks had the prime rib (both king cut), one had the ribs (looked awesome and huge serving), one had petite filet with macaroni and cheese, my fiancee had the salmon, and I had the scallops again.  I had a bite of the prime rib and it rocked my world, and both people who ordered it thought the same as well.  One had a minor complaint of the horseradish not being spicy enough, but he can be picky.  He also mentioned that the mashed potatoes didn't taste like much other than potatoes, but I don't see how that's a bad thing.My friend with ribs ate about half the rack and said they were great.  They came with fries which he also liked.  Other guest who ordered the filet enjoyed the steak, and was too full to even try the mac and cheese (she took it home to eat as a snack later).  Fiancee enjoyed the salmon but felt that it would have been better if served with a more filling side, as it came prepared with wilted spinach, some peas, and tomatoes.  Scallops for me?  Just look to my last review, they are killer, and that mustard vinaigrette is to die for.  My plate was once again clean when taken away.Dessert time!  I was already pretty full, but birthday guest had slice of peanut butter pie, one of the other guests had the lemon poppy bundt cake, which he enjoyed.  My fiancee had the ""Frozen Mudd Pie"" which looked amazing but WOW is it a lot of food.  Fiancee loved it but could only eat about half of it, which was still pretty impressive to me.Another great night at the Barn!  I'll mention in closing that as always, the rolls with that maple butter are out of this world.  Also, one final note...please bring back your cheesecake!  Half of the group was craving it and we were told you guys got rid of it...bring it back!",Zack S.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,2008/12/17,"The food and service are almost always very good. For the prices at this Cameron Mitchell restaurant , they should always be. We can't figure out why a $16 cheeseburger at an establishment of this caliber is not a grass fed burger. Are their steaks all grass fed ? No idea. This is a healthier , higher quality of beef , (grass fed. ) So maybe Cameron should  invest in at least the burgers. And The steaks as well. The burger was good , not great. But shouldn't everything on the menu be great ?YES.",Nick B.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,2/23/17,"Had the Ernest Hemingway cocktail which I strongly recommend. Then moved onto the wedge which I know is a stupidly simple salad, but it's so good (as was The Barn's). Ended on the queen size prime rib with a side of creamed spinach. Asked for med rare and got...med rare. Perfect. Just wish the creamed spinach didn't have pieces of bacon with it. Don't get me wrong--I love bacon but when you're having it with a big slab of beef, it's just a little much. And simple creamed spinach is so so good on its own. Also wish they offered cream corn! My brother had the filet mignon which also looked perfectly cooked. He finished his entire plate and commented on how his side of broccoli was not over cooked--he loved it. It's a steakhouse so be prepared to spend some $$$ unless you get a sandwich there. Pros: perfectly cooked beef and vegetablesCons: cost",Hana C.,,,,,,

I particularly enjoyed the chilled shrimp, fried chicken - yes, to the fried chicken. The salmon and fried capers...fried capers! You can dress up your salmon with other toppings. Oh, and their pecan French toast -- to die for! I did have a Caesar salad to begin for my veggie. I have to say they have a lot of options, you know the usual suspects, carving station, bacon, eggs, potatoes, two different pastas, salmon, cod, bread, cereal, soup stations...but I stuck with what was good. Oh, I didn't make it to the dessert station...the French toast was my dessert. The gang said they have an excellent Bloody Mary bar, and bourbon flights...I wouldn't know...tomatoes...yuck!

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,9/28/15,"TBH, I wasn't blown away.  I wanted to be blown away because (1) I love CM restaurants generally and (2) the restaurant occupies the old Hoggy's, which I loved.  Here's what I liked:  The restaurant has excellent decor; everything is subdued and classy.  The bar is a thing to behold (think wood paneling and muted lighting).  The selection of bourbons and bourbon-related cocktails is amazing.  But, the food is what I'd like to characterize as overpriced American steakhouse catering to the rich.  There was not a single, innovative thing on the menu and many were re-purposed CM standbys.  I'm not a huge steak fan and neither my friend nor I were in the mood for a huge meal, so we ordered cocktails, a salad, an appetizer, a side, and bowl of French onion soup each.  I did enjoy my cocktail (Hemingway) and the French onion soup.  However, everything else I ordered was just mediocre.  Also, the brussels sprouts were super oily, overcooked, bitter, and bland.  A shame, especially since it's $8.  Lastly, the service was just ok.  We purposely sat at the bar, where I usually receive consistent service at other restaurants.  But, it was a Saturday night, and the bartenders were extremely busy.  Our interactions with them frequently felt rushed and lacking.I may go back for cocktails only.  If I'm in the mood for dinner, then I'll likely stop by at Hudson 29 or even Cap City Diner nearby.",Anna S.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,5/20/17,"Service to be expected at a Cameron Mitchell establishment. The ambiance was wonderful, and the details were finely crafted. The food itself was also exceptional. The service was great, my only complain is that our waiter was not the happiest person in the world. You can tell, though, that he still was trying to please us. I just wish he had been perhaps a little more peppy. I am deducting one star for that. The second star I have chosen to deduct is for the fact that we were not seated until about fifteen minutes after we arrived - punctually and on-time - for our 7:30 reservation. You know, most restaurants these days don't accept reservations. And for most of us, when we go out to one that does, we expect a table to be reserved specifically for us, when we arrive. And a few minutes is not a big deal. Fifteen, however, is. Shortly after we sat to wait, we were offered a cocktail. In my...audacity, I suppose...I assumed this was complimentary for our wait. In which case the fourth star would have remained in place! But, lo and behold, I was wrong...we were promptly charged for the cocktail upon receiving it.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,9/27/16,"Meh. This place should be great but it just misses the mark. The prices reflect a place where one would reasonably expect high food quality and superb service. After three visits here I have found that you will pay a hefty bill while the rest is just Ok (sometimes).  Here are the observations from my three visits:Walking in the door you will see 3-4 people at the hostess stand. While there are lots of bodies they are not especially attuned to you the customer as you enter and you must make an effort to engage with them. Service while dining is mediocre. Empty water glasses and bread baskets have been common on all three visits. Lots of people running around on staff but again, not attuned to the customer or the experience. Also on the most recent visit we were on the patio and it took no less than 45 minutes to cash out as the server was also covering tables inside and was gone from the entire patio for at least 20 minutes after dropping off the bill. Food is meh. It isn't bad it just isn't as good as the price. As much as it is hyped up I have found food of equal quality at outback (but at a much lower price point).  For the massive prices sides are extras and also fork over some more $'s for a salad. Just way overpriced. Atmosphere is awesome. Great setting and outdoor area is especially nice. My conclusion is that this place needs a reboot. It should be great but just misses the mark in too many areas for their price point.",Michael G.,,,,,,

The mac & cheese is our favorite side, creamy and flavorful. Love the sharp goat cheese ravioli appetizer. Shrimp cocktail are meaty and pre-sauced. The crab cakes were good but the aioli scarce. Best dessert is the fluffy coconut cake with dark chocolate ganache. We've tried the crÌ¬me brÌÈlÌ©e, not nearly dark or crisp enough, but some may like it.

It free valet ( never really free as you should always tip the drivers) so all is good. We were about 15 minutes early of the res. No big deal, they were cleaning off the table and only had to wait 3-4 minutes. The server, Heather, was Jonny on the spot from the start to the finish. We started off with two orders of oysters and the calamari. The LF had been once before and there were only 6 oysters, when the plates arrived there were 8 on each order. They were small. They were super Shelly. They were mediocre at best. The calamari was prepared perfectly and the aoli was great. That was where the dinner took a nose dive. heather stops by a few times and seems a bit alarmed that our steaks have not yet arrived. The LF ordered the flat iron medium with a baked sweet potato, I ordered the T bone ""rare"". The meals were eventually served with many apologies for the delays. They didn't really take exceptionally long to me, but the server seemed to think that they should have been ready way faster then they were. Well now I know why. The t bone was a medium. The flat iron was a mixed bag. Well done on the edges and rare in the center. Heather came back pretty quickly to ask how things were. I showed the color of my steak and said the temperature was pretty far off. She asked if I wanted another. Not really, I don't want to wait for another steak. She said to ""hold on"". I at part of my potato and a few bites of a then chewy steak. Another server comes out with another t bone. Hands it to me and asks if I would like another potato. I had only eaten a few bites of the first potato so I declined. I expected her to leave my first potato but it was whisked away with the offending steak. There was very little sear on the top of the steak. Server waited for me to cut into it and it was red. So far so good and she left. First bite was cold. There was almost no cooking on the bottom side. This steak wasn't even cooked to blue. The bone edge was raw. Raw fat. I ate a small amount of the strip. Asked for the remainders to be packed away. Heather offers to buy us a desert for our trouble and drops off the menus. Loss of appetite left no interest in a desert and none of them seemed like they would travel well so we declined the free desert.

The rolls and honey butter on the table are amazing and I won't lie when I say I ate two or three before my meal even came out. I ordered the brisket meal which is smoked in house for 6 hours the day you order it. They pile the brisket high open faced on a large piece of Texas toast. The brisket was super tender and delicious, covered in the house made bbq sauce was fantastic. I swapped the greens the meal comes with for Mac n cheese and I don't regret it one bit. I also had a bit of a friend's flat iron steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare and the fried chicken is also of honorable mention. The experience was unfortunately a little sour as we had a 7:30 reservation on a Wednesday and we were not seated until about 7:55. We were placed in the outdoor back patio walled off with plastic tent walls while the temperature was near 20 degrees outside at a table that was still being set. The back patio was not set up for guests, extra chairs were stacked all over the room, and the tables were unorganized. It was clear that they messed up our reservation and were scrambling to set us up as fast as possible. After being dissatisfied with the seating situation we were able to be moved inside and the waiter was accommodating. For being a Cameron Mitchell restaurant, they definitely satisfied me with their food but I expected more out of the experience. Every restaurant has their start-up kinks though so I'm sure I'll be back to try them again.",Zeeshan S.,,,,,,

Their list was pretty good and it was cool that they had a variety of flights available. Drinks were tasty and strong!Everyone seemed to enjoy their food. I had steak and creamed spinach....delish! The wait staff was kind and friendly but had to be asked several times for a couple of things and didn't visit the table for long periods of time in a few instances.",Tabitha F.,,,,,,

For that reason, we will be back!",Jenny V.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,12/23/16,"Maybe just an off night- my husband and I love to eat out all over Columbus (the US for that matter) we try to make sure we've tried every fine establishment in search of the most perfect steak. This was one restaurant we had not made it to- and the doc I work for gave it a great review along with another gal I work with- so it was time to partake. We made a reservation for 7:30 and showed up at about 7:15. My husband let me out and went to park the car.  I walked in to 3 people ahead of me and 4 hostess at a table. They cleared out the folks ahead- and when I got up to the table- not 1 of the hostess raised their head to acknowledge me. This went on for longer than I could believe- to the point my husband had made it in, still no acknowledgement... another guy walks up and one of the hostess raised her head and greeted him instantly. Finally, another lifts her head and takes our info- after about 5 minutes of standing in front of 4 people without any acknowledgement. She tells us we're early and we will be seated closer to our reservation time, which was not a surprise- however, with 4 people, and not one greeting you, well that is unacceptable- and a true pet peeve of mine. We were seated around 7:40- which was fine, the wait was ok with us, but we were seated in the bar area right on top of another couple (shared seating) no one asked if this would be OK... and better yet, we were put at the 2 person seat right next to the door on 12/22. Needless to say, I had to eat our $150 meal... with my coat on?!   It was very loud in the bar area, soooo not what we were going for when we made our reservation. Common courtesy is to ask if the seating is OK- especially when visiting a 'fine establishment'.Now down to the food- our steaks were delicious most definitely- I got the $55 holiday menu that came with the 8oz filet, and my husband got the $49 14 oz prime ribeye- both came with sides. We also got the calamari appetizer. The calamari was fine-dipping sauces were good- but I do prefer calamari to be served with fresh lemon to squeeze over top, not just a fried plate of... nothing special calamari. Our meals came out promptly which was nice- timing for the food was spot on. Our steaks were delicious, the sides, well... for 50$ plates of food- you're paying for the steak alone, we will leave it at that. So all and all, the steaks were delicious, but the atmosphere at the bar and lack of courteousness from your front house staff- is not worth the price tag. Our server however, was exceptional- I wish I could remember his name, we did tip him accordingly for the holiday season as well, but the tip was for his service... nothing more. That is most likely our first, and last visit to this restaurant- we can get delicious steaks somewhere where your price tag comes with a better dining experience.",Crystal L.,,,,,,

From the maple syrup butter to simply boxing my left over burger and fries up separately (so the fries don't get soggy), we were so impressed. I highly recommend this place. Our server was Danny and he provided stellar service. He was genuinely warm, kind, friendly and attentive.  Never let my water glass go even half empty (a sign of a good server!) We ordered the braised short rib and burger. The ribs were melt in your mouth; you don't need a fork. The burger was excellent, and hearty - I couldn't finish it! We also tried the barrel aged manhattan flight which was fantastic. So impressed!",Katie K.,,,,,,

I also got a bottle of the Riesling.  Probably the best I've had.  It was half off wine night.  Applies to bottles only. I don't know if that's every weds or what.  I forget what our server said.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,2006/12/16,"My wife and I had dinner at The Barn last night for the first time. We are not Bourbon drinkers normally but thought we would try out a drink since they specialize in them. Our server was Chelsea. She was awesome! Chelsea was very friendly and explained the various drinks with us. She offered her opinion after being asked what we should try. I went with the Barn tea and my wife had the Bourbon Hemmingway. Both were great! You could taste the Bourbon but it was not overwhelming. For dinner I had a New York strip steak and loaded baked potato. The steak was prepared to order and was excellent. My wife had a roasted chicken salad which she said was delicious. My only complaint is that it is very loud inside. That is to be expected with a large open area such as this though. Although it was our first time here, it will not be the last. I would recommend The Barn for a date night out.",Ryan K.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,2012/11/16,"I am actually very surprised at some of the low reviews for the barn. We have gone twice, and both times our experience has been five star. Our first time was with our four-year-old daughter and the server was excellent with our child. That is really hard to come by in any restaurant much less a restaurant like the barn. He brought extra treats for her, made different animals and shapes with the napkin every time she had unfolded it, and kept her entertained although he was extremely busy with other tables as well.We decided to return for our anniversary dinner and to say the service was even better is an understatement. Our bartender Paul was not only extremely knowledgeable in all of the bourbons and whiskeys and drinks that the barn had to offer, but he also made a mean old fashion an amazing Manhattan. When it was time to be seated at our table, we were a bit disappointed we had to leave Paul's company due to his great conversation skills even though the bar was busy for a Saturday night. When we were seated, our server, Austin, was attentive, nice, and also very knowledgeable in the food offerings. My husband and I both took the suggestions that he made for our entrÌ©es. They had a red snapper dish they were offering for the holidays but I was able to order it as a standalone entrÌ©e and let's just say it melted in my mouth and every bite was a great one. My husband got the ribeye at the suggestion of the server served medium, and he claims it melted in his mouth! Once again Paul helped in the choice of my wine to accompany my dinner, and he was spot on yet again. If you decide to get dessert, I highly recommend the mud pie! I think we have a new favorite restaurant. Yes, the price is a little bit high, but it is on par with most Cameron Mitchell restaurant, and you get what you pay for. Excellent service, excellent knowledge, and remarkable food! Can't wait to celebrate again for my husband's birthday!",Erin F.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,2/19/17,"Sounds weird but I absolutely love the spaghetti...it is enough for 5 people, but it's so good. It has bits of roost beef or something in it with a vodka sauce and it's amazing. Service is hit or miss but it's usually okay:)",Amanda M.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,9/26/15,They have a great selection of wines. The bread and butter tastes like pancakes because the butter is infused with maple syrup. It can be a bit noisy by the bar. The decor of the restaurant is very neat. I had the short ribs and I could literally pull it apart with a fork. The mashed potatoes were also very good. My husband had the BBQ ribs and they were so tender he had to eat them with a fork and a knife. The Mac & cheese is also really great. I would recommend it as a side.,Christina H.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,5/16/16,"Four-top dinner on a lazy Sunday night.This former Hoggy's location went through an extensive Cameron Mitchell upgrade.  The look is spectacular.

Nice dish.Our hamburger arrived with cheese.  It wasn't supposed to be, and was corrected immediately.  Prepared to order.  Two orders of roasted chicken were well received by the table.  Their famous fried chicken, however, was less than stellar.  It was dry, mostly batter, and the quantity had to have been a child portion.  I should have commented to the waiter, but we were late for a show.We had no liquor; the iced tea was a very tasty brew.Overall, I expected more.  Growing pains?  I know I will try again, but I'll skip the famous fried chicken. Maybe it was an end of the weekend batch?",Michael G.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,4/25/16,"We went for brunch.  Overall it was good.  I was disappointed in a couple of things.  For that price I would expect the bacon to be crisp and each strip fried, instead you get good bacon mass cooked on a sheet in the oven, and they crowded it-  still sticking together when served in the chafer.  Even Frisch's prepares bacon correctly for their breakfast buffet.  The fried chicken was crispy and delicious, if you want breakfast - scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, crispy potatoes, french toast casserole and if you want lunch - the previously mentioned fried chicken, pasta primavera, glazed salmon, mac and cheese, freshly carved beef, and a selection of salads and sides.  The deserts- chocolate cake, coconut cake, brownies, key lime pie, peach cobbler, chocolate chip cookies, white chocolate macadamia nut cookies, and warm bread pudding.Expect plate clearing to be a little slow along with drink refills and clean silverware.  I think they are short staffed on the wait staff side of things.For the price - $30 a person - my expectations were set high and they were just short of meeting them.",Penne M.,,,,,,

Read a few of the reviews before entering some were ok some must be from crabby people. This was hands down the best service we (my friend and I) have ever had. We sat at the bar (full service) Devin waited on us. He was amazing gave us great selections and steered us in the right direction. We had apps and a salad. Apps were the goat cheese ravioli (all I have to say is OH MY! Yummy) and the prime rub carpaccio also delish. Then we had the wedge salad with flat iron steak also amazing. Next time I'm in the area I will definitely stop in again. Wendy the manager was also great. Super job Wendy and Devin.,Karla T.,,,,,,

As both a tea and bourbon lover, the Barn Tea was a perfect choice and very well balanced. I ordered the Fried Chicken and Mac n Cheese because DUH!  It really was great. The chicken was so moist and tender, and the breading was crispy. The Mac n cheese was awesomeeeee. And I love Mac n cheese more than most things in life. It was creamy and had a great soft cheese taste-not too sharp and cheddar-y.My boyfriend got the ribs. Great St. Louis style cut and the meat slid right off the bones. They give you a super fancy silver bowl the put the bones! The sauce was a good Carolina-style. Light and vinegary. I only had a taste because he loved em so much. They were excellent. We split a Mudd Pie. It was good (how can an ice cream bombe be bad, really?) but nothing to write home about.  And it was complimentary because it was my birthday!The last note. The honey butter for the dinner rolls was an excellent touch. Overall, I left happily fat, greasy, cheesy and a little buzzed.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,2006/9/15,"Pretty good, and they fixed a problem  At the spur of the moment went to try out The Barn.  The decor is nothing like a farm barn, very classy.  Went there for Sunday brunch ($30 per person by the way) and it is buffet style with specialty drinks and omelets made to order by the kitchen.  i had an all-meat omelet and tried many things on the buffet including the salad (just fine), mac and cheese (lacked flavor), breakfast potatoes (just ok), roasted chicken (great), salmon (meh), waffles (great), and fried chicken (more on this later).  There were a bunch of desserts to choose from as well, I tried the bread pudding (pretty good), and apple cobbler (excellent).  The fried chicken I tried was not cooked through and had red inside.  I cut open 3 different pieces and they are all this way.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,2005/8/16,"We went this evening for Mothers Day and I admit, I made the reservation with trepidation based on the mixed reviews not only on here but also from friends and family. First, I will say I love the atmosphere. It fits right in with its location. While it is an actual barn, it's beautiful inside. I didn't sit outside but the patio looked very nice and comfortable. It is pretty noisy and it was hard to hear each other at the table where we were sitting. It seemed like they had more tables crowded in the section than they should. We were also right by the patio door and it was a little chilly and a lot of servers back and forth. This is the only reason I'm not giving the restaurant 5 stars. I will say, all of the staff were fast movers and clearly focused on their jobs and the customers. Our salads and soup took longer than I would have expected, but our server (Jennie who was awesome BTW) got her Manager involved before we even mentioned it and took it off our bill without our asking. It wasn't necessary but a nice touch. The French onion soup was probably the best I've ever had. Mac and cheese and corn were to die for. The steaks were all cooked perfectly and delicious. Unlike some of CM's other steak houses, all of the entrees come with a choice of vegetable or baked potato. The additional sides are all large enough for at least 3 people. Overall we loved it and will definitely be back.",Amy P.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,12/16/15,"I have never been to a Cameron Mitchell restaurant I wasn't impressed with and this concept is no exception. We went on a double date with some friends and had 6:30 reservations on a Saturday night. I knew it would be busy but when we got there, there wasn't one single parking spot in their huge parking lot. Fortunately they have complimentary valet!The restaurant itself is very big. There's a big front room and several others off to the side including a screened on back patio. It has a very rustic feel but I recommend wearing something nice. I wore khaki pants casual Sperry sneakers and an untucked button up shirt and I felt a little under dressed. Ok, let's first talk about the drink selection. They have maybe 20-30 different whiskeys to choose from;mostly bourbons and ryes. They have a pretty extensive wine list too. I didn't notice and substantial beer menu but with all the whiskeys to choose from I didn't mind.We all shared the shrimp scampi to start.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the scampi sauce was very light and flavorful.I had the twin filets topped with Brie. They know how to do steak here! The filets melted in your mouth and the Brie was slightly melted but still in tact.For dessert, my wife and I split the chocolate cake. I'm usually more into lighter,fruitier desserts but this cake was very moist and very good. This place is maybe not an every week place but for great food for any occasion this is the place.",Daniel W.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,9/19/14,"My wife and I came here for their second night open for our 15th wedding anniversary. Knowing that this is a Cameron-Mitchell joint, I felt fairly confident while still a little skeptical that it was ""The Barn"".  We started out with Oysters in a Half Shell (my wife's choice), which was all as good as you'd expect. They fly their seafood in daily, which is good to know.  The taste and consistency was exactly as you'd expect...because they're oysters. I put on some of the cocktail sauce and tobasco, and indeed it was like eating a pile of snot covered in hot sauce. Like I said, it was my wife's choice. Oysters are pretty straight forward. They did indeed seem fresh. But hey...they're oysters.For the main dish, my wife got the Queen's Cut Prime Rib, and I got the 16 oz dry aged steak. Both of us rolled with Medium Rare. I was a little disappointed that this wasn't a fresh kill and that I didn't get to actually kill the cow. Since this is ""The Barn"" and is indeed a barn, I thought I might get to do that. But apparently that isn't an option. I didn't even see any chickens running around the barn, come to think of it.Anyhoo, both cuts of meat made us both swoon the entire time. The crust on my steak was sublime, and the inside was tender and tasty. I don't think I've ever had such a good steak in my life. Seriously, this was way better than anything the Ponderosa has ever offered to me...although the Barn doesn't have a huge-ass limpy salad bar. Remember those? Hahaha....all you can eat salad bar....yeah, that'd be NONE, thanks. I want the damn steak!Now for the bourbon. Listen to this - if the information I got is accurate (and if I remember correctly, because I did have a few) they teamed up with Woodford (my all time favorite bourbon) and took their bourbon and aged it for another year in their own oak barrels! You literally CANNOT get this anywhere else! It was damned good, and a little spicy. My wife had some sort of Woodford mixed drink, which I think is an abomination to do, although it was pretty tasty. But dammit, it's WOODFORD....why you gotta mix other stuff in it, woman?? I almost divorced her for it right there...but there weren't any judges around, and I've since gotten over it. Plus, how rude is it to divorce someone on your anniversary? I'll bet that's an etiquette no-no. I'll have to write to Miss Conduct or Dear Abbey and ask........she's dead? Dammit....In the end, we were offered a complimentary dessert. My wife wanted chocolate cake and she loved it....which is weird because she generally despises chocolate. But she totally dug it, and we teamed it up with an espresso. I think it was the best espresso I've ever had....out of the 4 or 5 in my lifetime. Two final notes - one is that the place is casual-ish. You don't have to feel pressured to wear a tie and slacks. Hell, the servers are all dressed in picnic-table-cloth style shirts. Yet it feels classy-ish, too. Second - our server was ""Seth"". He was absolutely splendid. He had all the answers, worked with confidence, and took very good care of us. I hope I tipped him well. Head was a little foggy by then.",Michael S.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,9/18/14,"I normally avoid new restaurants in their opening weeks, but I've been waiting for months for The Barn to open. The location used to be a Hoggy's, but that closed before I moved to the area.Opening night seemed to be going pretty smoothly - my boyfriend and I sat at the bar since we couldn't tell how long the wait would be. The bar has over 50 kinds of bourbon, including a couple that are exclusive to the restaurant, as well as three kinds of barrel-aged Manhattans. Wine list is on par with other Mitchell's joints. If you're gluten-free, the GF menu here is a godsend. It's almost as big as the regular menu, save for some fried items. The theme is mostly upscale home cooking, BBQ, steaks, and seafood - not particularly vegetarian friendly. The prices are up there, but I felt like it was worth it. I ordered a filet that came out perfectly medium-rare with some roasted vegetables on the side, and the general manager spoke to me about their efforts to avoid cross-contamination in the kitchen. Steaks come with a big roasted shallot that is melt in your mouth delicious, and steak sauce, which I think is unnecessary if you've got a good steak. Boyfriend had the brisket platter and he devoured it. The outdoor area has a huge patio and outdoor bar backing up to the creek. There are two large firepits with big chairs and blankets; I plan to take advantage of this setting before it gets too cold. Overall, a welcome addition to New Albany/Gahanna!

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,9/27/14,"I lived in this area for many years and went here when it was Hoggy's. Always loved the look/style but not so much the food. Enter Cameron Mitchell. He gets New Albany and it was that New Albany aesthetic; the dark wood, the chandeliers, the high-end outdoor furniture and a cool fire pit. It is my inspiration for my back yard renovation (on a smaller scale and yes I want a shed bar). The servers in red and white gingham and tight dark jeans and tiny aprons, high & tight pony tails. I NEVER saw Hoggy's this packed. They are printing money. At 10:30 there was still a decently filled lobby. The bourbon bar was packed and darkly lit. This gal likes the bourbon and oh man they deliver on the drinks.I enjoyed the Bourbon & Citrus. If you don't like the bourbon bite you'll still like this cocktail served up. I could've had 2, 3. But I stopped myself. I was in the mood for something lighter so went with the salmon salad. It was light and fresh. The grapefruit, light and slightly acidic and perfect with goat cheese. Oh a good goat cheese. A good-sized portion of salmon served next to bed of greens. The people watching was at its finest; New Albany elite, mixed with young professionals. I couldn't quite figure out the scene.Our server was a bit ditsy, but her inattentiveness was nice bc we were on the patio and wanted to chat for a bit. the menu is pricy so my friends opted for side salads, apps and wine. The house salad looked like it came from a bag. Meh. I saw some desserts fly by and think I dreamed of them. I'll be back back w hubby for a steak and bourbon.Side note: I somehow missed the free valet. Parking lot was packed and I thought I completely lucked out on a close spot. I parked and then a woman came out of the dry cleaning business with a snooty attitude to tell me that was a spot for her customers. I asked if there was a sign. Yes. A small metal sign. That sits on the ground to the left of the spot, completely hidden by the car parked in front of it. Geee, thanks lady. I gave her the attitude back and told her you can't see it. Remind me to never got to that business.",Erin D.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,10/26/15,"This was a special evening for us-my birthday as well as our anniversary celebration. We had a gift card for Cameron Mitchell - so I picked this one.

We will ask for him on future visits  Now for the food - we had a salad and the Oysters Bingo to share. Both very good. Then we both decided on the smaller prime rib with the roasted Brussel sprouts. OMG - the prime rib melted in the mouth!  I would have liked a little more horseradish in the sauce but it tasted fabulous!  We made sure to save room for dessert - so we chose Creme BrÌÈlÌ©e and their Peanut butter pie. We each liked our own selection.Overall a very pleasant evening with the hubbie and excellent food with over the top service. What a way to celebrate!  Thanks Danny!",Cher W.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,2010/6/14,"Cameron Mitchel has another homerun! This place is very classy, and I love that you can do reservations like at most Mitchell's Restaurant. Your dining experience can easily be from $$ to $$$$ depending on what you like. If you order from the Smoke House menu (Brisket, Ribs, Fried Chicken, Burgers, Beef Kabobs, etc.), this is a $$ restaurant with meals costing about $14-25. If you order from the Steak section, you need to purchase side items, so it's more of a $$$ to $$$$ price seeing as each meal will be around $40-50.Food was great, really loved the ambience. Edison bulbs throughout, bar area has some really nice decorations.Very classy entrance, and all of the servers are dressed in plaid and jeans. Makes it a classy-casual mix place.Outdoor seating looked amazing, it was enclosed and had fire pits and flame/heater towers.",Phil P.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,2006/5/16,"This restaurant is what should be expected of a Cameron Mitchell restaurant. The decor was rustic and very upscale. Not to say it was dated--it wasn't at all--but otherwise it reminded me of the hotel in the Shining. But clean and less murdery. I had the filet mignon Oscar, a staple of mine at CM restaurants going back to the 1990s. It was perfect. Better than ever actually. So tender you only chew because you don't want it to go away. The salad, sides, and bread were great as expected. I didn't drink this time but their scotch whisky and related cocktails definitely interest me for another visit. Take a date to this one.",Jason S.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,6/15/16,"Just don't. The in-laws took us here for an anniversary brunch, and we've regretted that decision for the past two months. Everything on the brunch tables was either over or under cooked, poor quality meat, and we're pretty sure the salmon was bad, as my daughter was the only one to eat it. She started feeling sick about 6 hours after eating brunch there, and ended up vomiting in the car, now almost two months later we still have a car that still smells like vomit, and no desire to return to this strange hodgepodge of 4 star service and mediocre food in what looks like a chain barbecue joint.",Steve C.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,4/13/16,"Man, this place tries hard to be a high scale steak house.  Unfortunately, at this point, they are just an overpriced Texas Roadhouse with worse food.  They made a good choice to have a valet to cover their horrible parking situation, but that's about where my compliments come to an end.  It was a special night, so I called and made a reservation.  We walked in and the restaurant was virtually empty.  They could obviously see that I'm a bigger guy who could use a little elbow room; yet, they disregard my size and my reservation of it being a special night and sit my wife and I in a tiny booth for 2 right next the high traffic waitress station.  They were empty and could have literally sat us ANYWHERE else in the restaurant and I would have been thrilled.  The waiter (while very nice and knowledgeable of the menu) saw my displeasure of the seating situation and simply offered no solutions.  Give me a table ANYWHERE else and make the customer happy.  Or simply give me a booth made for 4 people.  Anything but a table 2 feet wide would have made me happy.  Ok.  The seating sucked, but it wasn't going to ruin our good night.  So, let's move on to our order.  We shared some Calamari.  It was ok, but nothing to brag about.  The beer selection was decent, but nothing to brag about.  The steak was overcooked well beyond my ""Medium"" request, so the waiter generously made me a new one.  The second one he gave me was good in the middle, but in their rush to get it out quickly, they charred the hell out of the outside.  Oh well, I just sucked it up and ate it.  Now to the absolute worst part of the meal and something that management should be embarrassed about.... Instant Mashed Potatoes.  Are you kidding me?!?!  You're trying to be high scale and you try to pass off a soupy bowl of mush as real mashed potatoes?  Come on now.  That was the final straw for me.  Mistakes happen when accidentally overcooking a steak, but mixing powder and water into a bowl and charging a ridiculous price is just insulting to the customer.  My wife and I just paid our $120 bill (for dinner and drinks for 2) and accepted it as a lesson learned.  We will not be back.  For better quality at a fraction of the price, just visit your nearest Outback, Longhorn, Texas Roadhouse, ect...",Brian D.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,12/22/14,"I visited The Barn on one my many visits to Columbus, Ohio.  I have been to several Cameron Mitchell restaurants; all have been very good and this one is included.  The reason for 4 stars vs 5 is because a couple of thing still  needed tweaking.  DISCLAIMER: We went while they were still fairly new and still trying to get a rhythm going.  With that said....the service was pretty good but they were a bit overwhelmed.  They were 100% capacity and everyone was busy busy busy.  The bar was lively and looks like perhaps a nice place for a fun happy hour or small office Holiday gathering.  The main dining area was an open style.  Very open...not my cup of tea but for the theme it worked.  The menu was pretty good, not the best of all his places but good. I won't go on an on but as I said the service was a good as it probably could have been (at least in my opinion) but my godfather was with me and he is a restaurant snob.  So he was verbal about the errors.  I ran away to the bathroom while he spoke with the manager who dared ask how everything was....upon my return he gave my mother and I two very delicious pecan pies to make up for the service mistakes.  Needless to say I was/am happy.  I would go back....",Michelle D.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,5/29/16,We've eaten the Sunday brunch several times in the past with mixed results.  Today for the most part was very good and our waiter was excellent.  I only gave three stars though as for a restaurant of this caliber to take the cheap route is unforgivable.  By this I mean they no longer serve prime rib but instead now have pork and sliced turkey at the carving table to reduce costs. To serve two white meats with no beef of any kind is a poor choice considering how many chicken options were served bug no beef of any type.,Dean L.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,10/29/15,"I can't believe I'm giving a Cameron Mitchell restaurant three stars. But I need to based on my parties' experience. We sat in the bar area at 6:15PM and were in time for happy hour pricing on drinks and apps. So far all went well. Then disaster hit. Our waiter asked if we wanted another round before happy hour ""expired"". Sure we said. Then we ordered dinner and only three of the four entrees arrived. The forth was not what our friend had ordered. No problem he was told, we'll get a steak cooked immediately. Thank goodness we didn't wait. All three of us had nearly finished eating when the fourth entree arrived. Had deserts and all went well, until the bills arrived. The second round was charged at full price. We we're told we put our order in too late. But when we were asked if we wanted a second round we were told happy hour was still in effect. $125 later, tax and tip included we were somewhat taken aback.",Bill W.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,5/28/15,"I'd been wanting to try The Barn ever since the day it opened. But with it being on the other side of town from where I live, it took me a few months to finally make it out here. I don't particularly mind the drive, it's more so the fact that reservations here are so hard to get, to the point where you have to book on OpenTable close to 2 weeks ahead of time to get a decent time slot! Fortunately, my first visit to The Barn did not disappoint. I started out with a glass of Woodford Reserve Double Oaked bourbon on the rocks. At $11/glass, it's fairly expensive. However, they give you a pretty generous pour-- at least twice the amount of bourbon I was expecting. So that was pretty great. (And good thing I had a DD!) I'm more of a Scotch and Japanese whisky drinker, but I really did enjoy the Woodford Reserve. Next time I'd like to try their house blend Woodford Reserve.Our server had a trainee working with him, but the two of them worked well together to provide us with excellent service. Part of the reason I really love Cameron Mitchell restaurants isn't necessarily just the food, but the consistently good service. We'd been to this building previously when it was still a Hoggy's. While the interior has been completely revamped, I could still flash back to when it was a Hoggy's and say ""Hey I've sat in that booth before."" So that's not so good. In terms of interior decor among Cameron Mitchell's newest restaurants, The Guild House takes the cake in my opinion. We did not get any appetizers but did start out with salads. I got their wedge salad, which I thought was pretty delicious. I originally gained my love for wedge salads at Mitchell's Fish Market, where the wedge is rather large. So by comparison The Barn's wedge felt a little small... but not a big deal.We were served a complementary bread basket, which came with some sort of flavored butter. I think it may have been cinnamon flavor. Regardless, I thought it was delicious. My wife didn't like it as much however. For our entree, I got the 16oz bone-in dry aged strip steak, my wife got the fried chicken, and we got our daughter the kid's burger. As is the case with other Cameron Mitchell restaurants, the ""kid's"" burger is pretty much the same size as an adult burger, but at half the price. I personally think that's pretty great, as it made my daughter full AND the remaining half burger gave my wife lunch for the next day. My wife's fried chicken was delicious, although perhaps not quite as good as Cap City's southern fried chicken. As for the steak, I'll dedicate a whole paragraph to it since I'm a steak snob. So first of all, the steaks here are expensive. But they are competitively priced compared to other prime steakhouses in the area. My 16oz dry aged strip steak was $45. In comparison, Smith & Wollensky's 14oz dry aged sirloin is $51 and J Gilbert's 18oz dry aged bone-in ribeye is $47. I should mention that The Barn and J Gilbert I believe are the only prime steakhouses in Columbus where the cost of the steak actually includes a side. At say Hyde Park, you're gonna be paying another $10 for a side of mashed potato on top of your $40~$50 steak. My steak at the Barn came out cooked perfectly to medium-rare as I had ordered it. I was surprised/disappointed at the relative lack of char on the surface of the steak, considering their menu specifically advertises that the steaks are ""seasoned and broiled at 1200 degrees."" The meat itself was tender and flavorful... but not quite as tender and flavorful as I typically expect from a ""dry aged"" steak. Granted, how long the beef was actually aged for makes a lot of difference here. The menu at The Barn doesn't specify how long the steak was actually aged for, so who knows. For what it's worth, I think the 21 day dry aged strip steak that you can buy at Giant Eagle Market District is more flavorful and tender. Of course, you'd have to know how to cook that said steak properly, so for most of us without culinary training, the steak at The Barn is still excellent. Overall though, I think the 14oz NY Strip Steak @ The Ocean Club ($44) is still the best steak you can get at a Cameron Mitchell restaurant. So yeah, The Barn is a really good restaurant. At this point, I wouldn't call it the best steakhouse in Columbus nor the best Cameron Mitchell restaurant in Columbus, but I do think it's got the potential to be both. We'll definitely be back in the near future.",Kaoru M.,,,,,,

Solid cocktail with a alot of good flavors.We started off with the Goat cheese ravioli, I could have eaten an entire bowl of them, really good.  Nice sauce with mushrooms and bacon.  I decided to order the braised short ribs and ate every single piece that was in the bowl.  It was perfectly cooked short ribs, fantastic potatoes and carrots.  My mouth is watering right now thinking about it.For dessert, we ordered the coconut cake--out of control.  The cake was so fresh, lots of coconut but not over the top.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,7/22/16,"This was our third trip to The Barn.   The first two trips were underwhelming.   We first tried The Barn during their first month and we had excellent food but bad service.....we just could not get butter for a baked potato.Our second trip was abysmal.   I ordered a prime rib medium rare and it arrived medium well.  We were seated in the bar which I didn't care for.   A $100 plus dinner that I would have enjoyed more at the Golden Corral.We made our third trip this week only because our good fiends wanted to try it. I ordered the prime NY strip medium rare and a baked potato, butter only.   The steak was cooked perfectly and I never had a better NY strip.   The baked potato was quite possibly the smallest I have ever seen and I did not get any butter.  Finally after I was half way through the potato the butter arrived...just a little dab of butter, but enough for this sorry little potato.  All of this I could have ignored but I paid $8 for this potato and I just couldn't forget my first visit regarding the butter.My steak and the rest of the food in our party deserved 5 stars.

I don't mind paying $50 for brunch and have done so on numerous occasions at other places.

I was full after one plate, but went back for more because I figured if I wasn't going to get my money's worth in quality, I might as well fill up on quantity. (My logic is extremely poor, and I made myself sick.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,2008/9/15,"The Barn is a restaurant I so want to give a 5 star rating, but it is always falling short. It is a Cameron Mitchell restaurant, located a half mile from my house, cool venue in an old barn design, and great menu of steaks. However, no matter how many times  we go and our optimism for a better experience, it never measures up. The design is going for a look. For me, it is a bit too farmhouse kitschy. That said, the bar is quaint and the outdoor seating is fantastic, though seasonal. Has a great wine menu and many available by the glass. Terrific line up of steaks, prime rib, salads and the roasted Brussels sprouts are to die for. That said, just about every time we go the burgers or steaks are over done and we need to wait on a new meal. They are very accommodating, but it really interrupts the flow of the meal. When you're paying $40-50 for a meal, it is reasonable to expect the kitchen gets it right the first time. Also, found it odd that sometimes they serve salads with dressing mixed and sometimes on the side. Getting a $10 Caesar salad with dressing on the side, feels very much like what you would get at a second or third tier chain steak house, not a high end Cameron Mitchell restaurant. The wait staff is always incredibly accommodating and fix the issue. They are quick to comp a dish when there is an issue. However, at the price point, food should be perfect first time. We expected the first 6 months that it would take some time for them to iron out the wrinkles, but now into their second year, it is disappointing that they haven't. We really want the Barn to succeed for some many reasons, so do hope that they bring up the consistency and quality. If you go, try to sit outside, and focus on the smaller dishes and/or sides. That way you won't be too disappointed about your $40 steak coming to you overdone.",Virginia G.,,,,,,

The filet was much smaller than we were lead to believe and the potatoes resembled the potato chunks you get on a breakfast plate at Denny's. The other trip I ventured into the bbq.

The only downside was the periodic barrages of cottonwood seeds coming at our drinks and plates.The butter and bread served with dinner was excellent. We shared the calamari appetizer, which was perfect. The breading was light and they were fried perfectly. My wife had the twin filets topped with brie and loved her dish.

My friend had the red fish and raved about it and her husband had the kabobs, which again were cooked perfectly.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,2008/8/16,"We went here for our anniversary this weekend and were disappointed. They seem confused on whether they want to be a neighborhood, family-friendly steak house or an upscale dining restaurant. The decor was beautiful and seems to have taken a lot of influence from Ralph Lauren and Blackberry Farm in TN; it had that same beautiful equestrian club feel and I wish I could give 4.5 stars on decor. Other than that, it was just meh. Our reservation was at 6:30 and they were already out of a main menu item, prime rib. That seems like terrible planning by the kitchen, especially on a weekend night. Our server seemed a little scatterbrained and almost spacey (almost scared) even though it really wasn't that busy (well over half of the tables were empty, it seemed). Water glasses were left unfilled and she needed some help getting the dessert out. It was extremely loud despite the fact that it wasn't that busy, and the music was a weirdly bass-heavy selection of modified pop music (which was also way too loud, especially because we were right under a speaker). Also, it would be nice if they could implement at least a collared shirt dress code, since there were multiple people in the dining room in t-shirts, which was... surprising. Food was fine, but not anything I couldn't get anywhere else for less money, though I will say the cheese crust on the french onion soup was delicious (the soup itself was a little flat and lacked the depth of flavor you expect from said soup).All in all, not a dinner I'd be willing to pay $150 for again. It needs a lot of refining and better management. I'm more than willing to pay for good ambiance, but this isn't it.",K S.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,8/20/16,"This was a typical Cameron Mitchell restaurant.  His corporation has proven that they can be consistent in all of his restaurants, but sometimes, consistency equals mediocrity.  Personally, I've never had a bad meal at a C.M. restaurant and The Barn was no exception.  The place was busy for a Thursday night around 6:00 PM, and it isn't a small building.  That was a good sign.  Much like other C.M. restaurants, the staff were very professional and knowledgeable.  The place focuses on meats and bourbon, and as far as the whiskey went, our server really knew his stuff.  My wife ordered the burger, which was excellent, my kids got the normal burger and fries or chicken fingers from the kid's menu, which had huge portions.  I ordered the prime rib with a loaded baked potato.  The prime rib was just OK, for the price.  Now I realize that you aren't going to get good prime rib on the cheap, but when I pay top dollars for prime rib, I want it to knock my socks off.  For my birthday every year, my wife and I go to The Top in Bexley, where the prime rib is like a bloody piece of heaven.  The Top sets the bar high, and it's unfair for me to compare the two places....  Or is it?  I pay the same prices at The Top for my prime rib that I paid at The Barn.  Over all, we enjoyed our dinner though.",Ty W.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,3/31/16,"For steak in Columbus, I know of none that top this one.  I have had dinner on 3 occasions and both the steak and the whiskey selection were great.  The service far exceeded other steak houses in Columbus. However, the big hit for me was the Sunday brunch.  It was awesome.  The selection was great, the food was warm and not dried out and all selections were plentiful.  The entire family really enjoyed it.  Again, I have not had a better Sunday brunch in Columbus.I notice that some complain about the pricing and I do admit that it is not cheap, but you know that before you make the reservation.  If you want cheap, skip The Barn --- try White Castle.  If you want to treat yourself to a great meal, hit The Barn.",Rick B.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,1/19/15,"I went here for a dinner and had a decent meal.So why the low review? Because the meal was only decent, but the prices are not. For my main course, I ordered a filet mignon that came out so salty I couldn't taste any flavor from the meat. The chips/crackers served with spinach-artichoke dip were also super salty. The highlight of the meal turned out to be the bacon-wrapped shrimp appetizer.Basically, midrange food for high range prices. Stay away or get someone else to pay.",Brian B.,,,,,,

I had such a fun experience every time I went and that was definitely for the wait staff as well!I love Cameron Mitchell Restaurants and this is the most laid back but still ""high class""/ white table cloth, type of place. So if you are looking for a fun experience, amazing food and wine, but a little more laid back, This is your spotOnly critique, I got the steak adding blue cheese on the top and the blue cheese was SUPER salty I had to brush it off in the endYou can ask for a side of Bearnaise. mmmmm",Josie G.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,4/25/15,"I've been here multiple times, always in the Bourbon bar area. There is a side entrance by the parking lot or you can valet and walk in through the front. The atmosphere has dim lighting like a cigar smoker's lounge without the cigars. The location is upscale but the venue is dressy casual...anything goes. I love to sample the Bourbon in different drink concoctions and if you ask they can create things off the menu. Lately I've been a Hot Toddy girl. I personally love Cameron Mitchell and have enjoyed every restaurant concept he has created! Here I have had dinner, dessert and night caps. Come as you are, you will love the service.",Tanisha S.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,2007/2/16,"Food is good.  Service is not.We have frequented this restaurant a number if times.  Our experiences can be summed as follows:.  A Friday night dinner where our waiter ignored us (no bread despite request, nowhere to be found, no refill on drinks, really lily long wait for entrees) in lieu of the table next to us drinking litres of alcohol. A Sunday brunch for 6 with a very attentive waiter - restaurant was moderately crowded, but service was good. 3 or 4 date nights where service was 50/50.  Sometimes we had attentive service...sometimes. no wait staff to be found.  A Sunday night family dinner where the waitress was clearly busier serving the party of 20 in the party room.  Why does dinner have to take 3 hours at 6 pm on a Sunday night with no one on the restaurant?.  Mothers day - was the last straw...60 minute wait on a reservation at 1130 am, 1.5 hours after the restaurant opened.  Clearly, somebody decided to overbook and thought it a good idea to just make people wait.  When brought to the managers attention, she offered to simply move us to the front of the line - No thank you, and you completely missed my point, which was 'when people eat out to celebrate mothers day, they expect the experience to be positive and the restaurant to come close to honoring reservation times'.  We were packed in like sardines.  Valets don't wish mom a happy mothers day when opening car door, little acknowledgement from wait staff or front of house that it's mothers day.The Barn has a long way to go to get to the class of service needed to serve the patrons they want to frequent their establishment on a more consistent basis.  My expectation for this restaurant is that wait staff remain attentive throughout my meal (at this point I'd settle for don't disappear), I sit within 5-10 mins of my reservation (otherwise what's the point of it) and on special occasions staff recognize the celebratory nature of the day and acknowledge it in a friendly way.Unfortunately we won't be back.  Good food is a pre- requisite to our dining experience and we've given this restaurant more than ample opportunity to get their service levels to match their food quality and come close to their prices.  It's a package dining experience for us, and this places misses the mark consistently at least 50% of the time.",Lisa B.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,10/23/14,"We went here for dinner last night- party of 6 in total. Food was fair/ good but service and speed of service was horrendous.We made a reservation about a month in advance- they attempted to seat us in the back corner of the restaurant out on the enclosed patio- not happening on a 45 degree night! They did accommodate our request to move inside thankfully. The server was quick to greet the table and get our drinks and then everything just kinda fell apart... Our drinks were never refilled- we had to flag the server down for another round after sitting with empty drinks for about 25minutes. Then they forgot our salads entirely. After finishing our meal we had to wait about 40minutes to get our bill. At this point no one had been over to see how dinner was- not a manager or our server. Needless to say we were NOT happy. Finally we asked a busboy to send over a manager- he was apologetic and gave us 'complimentary cards.' Which was a nice  attempt to save the experience. Bar looked super cool and we all loved the sauerkraut balls. We'll probably be back for drinks and appetizers- on the bar side. But will steer clear of the restaurant side until they get the kinks worked out!",Jessica V.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,2010/1/14,"My visit to the Barn sure beat the heck out of all those visits to the Tool Shed as a kid.  First off, the atmosphere: they really did an excellent job in rehabbing the old Hoggy's into an upscale joint with a rustic feel.  The faux water spouts (or maybe they're meant to be barrel taps) on the bar for the ladies to hang their purses was a nice touch.  While the decor is top notch, the place is still new and jam packed with people (even at 8 on a Tuesday), which makes it very loud (i.e. not the best for a romantic meal unless you enjoy shouting out your sweet little nothings).  As a solo diner, I could still hear my thoughts, so all was good.Second, the service - five stars, top notch - attentive without being overbearing.For my meal, I chose two apps: the Soul Rolls and the Sauerkraut Balls.  The Soul Rolls consist of brisket and greens actually baked inside of a roll.  The thin layer of brisket in the roll resulted in a complete inability to taste it.  The BBQ sauce for dipping tasted like a bad combo of ketchup, vinegar and bourbon (mostly ketchup).  One star for the Soul Rolls.The Spicy Sauerkraut Balls weren't all that spicy (not much sausage in there).  They came rolled so perfectly and uniformly that they didn't look handmade (the presentation was more of a food-service freezer to fryer to plate product).  That said, this app really does taste fantastic.  I'd give them five stars, but the mayonnaise based sauce they came with had been left out so long in its little cup that it had yellowed/browned on top by the time it was served to me, which soured me a bit on the plate. I'll definitely be back to try one of the pricier entrees.  While the overall experience was A-OK, I can't say that I was overwhelmed with the food I had . . . maybe I just made poor choices.",Brian D.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,10/19/14,"As an ardent fan of Cameron Mitchell restaurants I could not wait to eat at this new place. Overall I would rate my first visit as a B+ primarily driven by sloppy service and timing of how the food came out of the kitchen. We enjoyed the energy of the Bourbon Bar while waiting for our table. The quality of the food was a mixed bag: outstanding crab legs and beef brisket. However, the Chateaubriand for two was a disappointment. The sloppy service was punctuated by the following: extraordinarily long wait time between appetizers and entrees; the server did not have the foggiest on how to carve the chateaubriand; dropped one slice on the serving tray and then proceeded to just put it on the plate; empty bread baskets were never removed; somewhat misleading verbiage on the menu relative to the sides for the chateaubriand: found out that there is only one side when the greens did not arrive and we had asked for roasted potatoes AND greens. Pointed this out to the server but no action.",Harris M.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,2010/12/14,"I love CM restaurants here in town ... But this one missed the mark completely from a dining perspective. The building and bar is very nice but for me that's where it all ended. Although I had reservations, when I arrived, they sat us back by the kitchen. We couldn't even talk across the table as the clamor and clanking around back there was very disturbing. Had I just walked in off the street, I would accept it as I didn't make reservations, but since I did I was left wondering why they sat us back there when there were plenty of other tables open in the main area. I asked for the hostess and she happily moved us to the main room. Meals were frankly overpriced and flavorless. I don't mind paying for a great meal, but the food at a Lonestar or Bob Evans was much better and a fraction of the price. I was shocked that this was at a CM venue!We ordered the prime rib, which was tasteless. The 5 finger pork chop and ribeye had no flavor. And the flat iron steak which was recommended was so tough, your teeth hurt from the chewing. When we asked the server if that was normal for a flat iron, she stuttered a bit and said yes. The manager kindly came over and comp'd that although I didn't ask. I have to say the best part of the meal was the French onion soup and the salad dressing. The cocktails were ok but nothing to get excited about. Staff was cordial but we met them due to the problems we had. I am bummed as I wanted another CM to look forward to dining at. We went here to check it out as a venue for our sons rehearsal dinner next year. The bourbon lounge, fire pit, and expected great food were all great draws. However, as of now, unless I hear things change dramatically, that's out. Too bad, I had such high hopes for the place!",Dave L.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,2010/4/14,"I was excited to try The Barn because of my experience at other Cameron Mitchell restaurants but this one falls short of the usual quality and value. You can get better steaks for half the price at other area chain restaurants. For $42 I was expecting an incredible ribeye but was disappointed with the thickness which made it difficult to obtain a medium rare. The quality and flavor of the cut was just Okay.  Not mouthwatering delicious as promised by our waiter. Someone at our table ordered ribs. The half slab was too small. If you want ribs in Columbus don't mess around.  Goi to City BBQ! I did like the Bourbon selection but they were priced way too high. I think I'll fire up my own bbq,  pour my own glass of bourbon and enjoy a night at home for a fraction of the cost.",Andrew S.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,12/20/15,"BRUNCH- It's buffet style so be prepared for that. I had a bloody mary which was nothing special especially for $8. The buffet is $30 a head with soda/tea/coffee included. The buffet had luke warm eggs, luke warm eggs benedict, fried chicken, average waffles(not freshly made in front of you), Mac n cheese, green beans, salad, bagels, lox, fruit salad, bacon/sausage links, etc. This brunch would be work maybe $18-20? Nothing special at all nor was the service. It wasn't horrible service but definitely ""buffet"" clientele service. The omelet was meh as well. I have not had dinner here yet but not sure I would even come back. Ocean Club has the best service and much better quality. The Barn, you should offer a small brunchy menu for those who don't feel like messing with a buffet. You should also think of something like a bloody mary cart/bar.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,2/17/15,"What an amazing experience !! My boyfriend and I came in on Monday to celebrate our Valentine's Day (we both bartend in a restaurant so we have to celebrate late) we were seated at a comfy booth and were originally greeted by a gentlemen named clide. He was taking away our extra place settings but we had such a great conversation with him. Quite a people person and deserves some praise for that.Our server heather was just as excellent. She was extremely knowledgable about the drinks as well as the food. She made a few recommendations including the baked oysters. I'm not a fan of oysters but this wasn't too bad. The flavor was fantastic .. Almost like a spinach artichoke dip. My boyfriend ordered the filet and I the crab legs. My crab legs were AMAZING. Huge crab legs. My boyfriends steak was very good.. But perhaps a little bit less seasoning could make it better. The seasoning was very good.. But a little overwhelming with the amount that was on there. Cooked to perfection though. We also ordered the chocolate cake to go with our joel gott cab wine... Oh my gosh that desert was fantastic !! Not too rich and the perfect balance with red wine. The food is a little pricy .. But given it was a special occasion for us, we didn't mind. We stopped at the bar afterwards for a drink & the blonde bartender working (didn't catch her name) was very kind and attentive despite it being late & us being the last two at the bar. We chatted away with her for quite some time which was really enjoyable ! I will say when looking around while we were eating, those servers did not stop moving/working.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,10/16/14,"Let me start by saying that I had previously worked in the restaurant biz for 15 years. I am also an experienced cook.     The atmosphere was great, love the the different areas in the restaurant and the country casual vibe. The service was good except for a few mishaps. A side was forgotten but when we brought it up it was taken care of very promptly. I ordered my steak cajun because I like things spicy. My steak was not spicy and hadn't been seasoned well either, but it was still a good cut of meat. The appetizers were not very good. The Soul rolls are supposed to have brisket and braised greens, I was hard pressed to find any brisket.   The ribs are supposedly smoked, my bourbon had more smoke flavor. They were definitely oven cooked, I've had plenty of delicious smoked meats to be able to differentiate. My broccoli had absolutely no seasoning, no s&p, no olive oil,  no nothing. The apple pie was cold.      Any decently skilled cook could produce a better steak and sides at home for a third of the money. Maybe it's just new opening bugs.",Rob V.,,,,,,

The chicken is a must try and the mac and cheese was nice and creamy.  We also had the maple bourbon salmon.  This was very good.

Spinach salad was good and the twin filets topped with brie were cooked perfectly. I do like that if you chose to order a cut of beef you get a choice of side. I'm accustomed to always needing to order that in addition to a steak, so it's nice bonus that it is set up this way. I choose the green beans with pecans...yum!

But it's an occasion and an occasion that we don't do often, so I don't mind, as long as the food is worth it.  AND IT WAS!I had the beef kabobs and they were seasoned and cooked perfectly.

HOLY MOSES was it delicate, moist, melt in your mouth delicious!  I highly recommend getting it.We capped off the night with cocktails out by the fire pit.  So cool.  None of us drink bourbon but at a place known for bourbon we had to give it a go.  I had the Hemmingway, my mom a citrus number, my partner an apple number, and my dad (to cool for school) straight up bourbon on ice.

Very good, nice change from standard.Wine selection was excellent.Wedge with bacon, tomato, pickled onion and blue cheese dressing was remarkable.Caesar salad with white anchovies added was just like that at Marcellas. Very good.Double cut pork chop cooked to perfection.Vegetable sides and mashed potatoes were done well.Baked onion that comes with the prime rib was delicious and had a french onion soup flavor.Needs some work:The pork chop was listed in the menu as apple wood smoked. I couldn't taste any  smoke flavor and there wasn't a smoke  ring. The BBQ sauce tasted like catsup. I pushed that off to the side.The prime rib was cooked rare as ordered, but was tough, chewy and littered with silverskin. There was no marbling at all and was a grade lower than select.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,9/26/14,"Our New Favorite Restaurant!After hearing The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek would be serving St. Louis style ribs, we made a reservation, figuring if anyone was going to do ribs right, it would be a Cameron Mitchell restaurant. We were right!The new restaurant is elegant yet cozy, a big improvement over the Hoggy's that used to occupy the building. Our server, Josh, was delightful and very knowledgeable about the food and drinks menus.We ordered our ribs and sides, then sat back enjoying the wonderful flatbread, warm rolls and delicious butter. When the bread basket is yummy, the food is usually good, and The Barn is no exception.While my husband enjoyed his Woodford Reserve Double Wood Private Selection bourbon, Josh returned to ask us to order something else because the tenderness of the ribs was not up to the chef's standards. I had been hotly anticipating these ribs and was terribly disappointed. After much consternation, we ordered the 5-finger pork chops. Josh put in our new order, then came back with the manager, Cliff, who offered his apologies.When Josh returned with our order, we were delighted to see he was bringing us ribs! Then he and Craig explained that since the pork chop orders had already been placed, they were comping us on those and we could take them home with us. The pork chops were brought out plated, so we could see the beautiful presentation and the huge serving size.Meanwhile, we couldn't stop moaning over the luscious ribs. Tender, falling off the bone, seasoned and smoked just right, with BBQ sauce on the side so lip-smacking good I took home the extra. I also went home with the recipe for the wonderful coleslaw.

There is an unfortunate trend that has now come to Ohio restaurants - charging a fortune just because you can.  New York learned this bit years ago but I never thought it would come to Columbus.

The customer base probably does not care and until the next fad comes along this place will do well.

But when your food is mediocre at best, that really doesn't matter to me. The rolls and butter were ok, nothing special. Oysters Casino were so so. A lot of cream in them, which was overwhelming. We also ordered the French onion soup. The server went on and on about how they take so much time to prepare the soup and gave us every detail on how they cook it. Honestly, it was just ok. After his big speech, I was expecting something divine. Eh. For entrees, I ordered the Ribeye and a baked potato. My bfriend ordered the Prime Rib w mac and cheese as a side. Ok, I have had plenty of ribeye steaks in my lifetime...and I know what to expect. Super tender, melt in your mouth cut of meat.  My steak, first of all, was too thick for a ribeye. Then, I cut into it and it was pretty much blue. I ordered in Med Rare, it was not even close to Med. It was rare. I let the server know and he asked if I wanted them to bring it up. I said, sure. When he brought it back it was Med Rare, but still, very chewy, tough...and just not a good piece of meat! $44 for the blah steak and a baked potato with sour cream and butter.

We had the bourbon flight and strip steaks cooked to prefection. I only wish we saved room for dessert.  Service was great.  We will be returning real soon. Loved it.",Moe L.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,11/15/15,We came for dinner right when they first opened. All of the food was good but seemed a quality we could have made at home. I chalk this up to being a new restaurant. We came today for brunch and everything was great. The brunch buffet has a great selection of food. The adult buffet is $30. A little pricy for me but okay for a special occasion.,Kelly T.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,10/26/14,"Tonight was my wife's birthday, and being right around the corner we decided give The Barn a try.  The atmosphere was great, they did a wonderful job redoing the place, kepted the character of the old barn, but making it upscale at the same time.  Love the outdoor spaces they have created too.  Unfortunately, atmosphere will only get you so far, it is the service and food that will keep a restaurant around for the long run.   The food was excellent, some of the best prime rib I have ever had.  You could cut it with a fork.  The problem was we got our dinner before the appetizers or even bread.  Not a mistake for a restaurant trying to compete with some of the best in this city can afford.  A restaurant of this caliber your expect everything just happen, like they are not trying, and when done well it is one of the reasons we all love dining out, but when it does not happen as expected you leave disappointed and you don't return. Okay now everyone can make a mistake and in my opinion when a mistake happens it is how you recover that shows the true colors of any business.  Once our waiter noticed what happened he immediately apologized, which is what I expected, but then got the manager to talk to us.  Everyone was very apologetic and did everything they could to make the remaining time there as special as possible.  When my wife ordered dessert the manager asked her if she had a close second she mentioned a couple of other items she was thinking about and they came back with a plate of all three.  In the end I was expecting to be comp one of the meals or the dessert. but the manager comped everything.  Not expected, but was a nice touch.So I do recommend The Barn.  The food we had was very good, the atmosphere is great, and the staff is friendly and welcoming.  We will be back.",Kevin H.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,12/28/14,FALSE ADVERTISMENT! !!! Waffles not made to order nor is the omelet.  Server said waffles arent even made here at the location and they were burnt.  Omelet was dry and over cooked.  Salmon was nice but cold. Mushroom ravioli was nice but cold. Chicken was dry and under seasoned.  Shrimp cocktail was the only thing worth trying but how can you mess that up? The mac and cheese was like soup. The manager stopped by my table to ask how was it when I told her I had higher expectations she asked me of what??? I told her since this is a Cam'ron Mitchell restaurant it should serve as such. She did give attitude but took care of our bill.  Never will I return if you charge 30 per person I expect nothing less of excellence.,Keylah R.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,9/25/14,"While I understand that I went to this restaurant during its inaugural first week, this is not at all up to Cameron Mitchell standards.  Though the prices are what you would normally expect from a Cameron Mitchell restaurant the food was not.  Specifically, the Prime Rib was served cold and it had a very strange color to it.  it was as though it had been cut hours ago and spent the interim under a heat lamp.  The brisket was served only luke warm.When I sent the prime rib back, after one bight, I expected that I would speak to a manager; it wasn't till until 20 minutes later, after I asks my waitress, that a manager came over.  What a disappointing experience.  To top it off....the bill included the full price of the cold, overly heat lamped prime rib.I will not go back.",Sarah S.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,3/29/16,"Enjoyed dinner tonight. Service from start to finish was friendly and terrific, thank you, Danny!

Our only complaint is the music is too loud in the bar area, even when asked to turn it down. Overall, a great experience.",Allison W.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,2/19/15,"This is without a doubt the nicest restaurant in the New Albany area! The bourbon lounge is the place to be... Great ambiance, and a very nice staff.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,2005/8/16,Poorly managed and dirty.   Especially for a Cameron Mitchell's restaurant.   We were seated 40 minutes after our reservation time.   It was brunch only this particular day.   And the buffet tables were dirty with food all over the tables and floor.  The food selection at the buffet was limited and people were milling everywhere making it seem more unsanitary than your average buffet.   The $30 price tag is not warranted.  It was a highly disappointing experience and we won't be back.,Ni T.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,8/31/15,"We were hesitant due to the mediocre reviews but found The Barn to be excellent in many ways.We arrived 30 minutes early for our reservation so that we could check out the Bourbon bar. The place is gorgeous and the bar service was top notch. I had the special Woodford Reserve and it was great and they certainly didn't short poor anything. We also had the baked oysters which are worth going back for.We had requested a quiet booth for our anniversary and they got us a great table. I will admit that our waitress was a bit below what you typically find at this dollar level of restaurant but there was no problem with attitude or attentiveness. We found all of our food to be great and very comparable to what we get at Mitchell's Steakhouse or Hyde Park.",Scott C.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,6/20/15,Loved the atmosphere at The Barn and the service was great as well.  The steaks were good but we had some things that were less than par.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,2001/4/15,"Our first visit to The Barn was New Year's Eve.  I made the reservations through OpenTable in October.  Our experience could not have been more disappointing.  After having reservations for over two months, we were seated in the bar area at a small table along the wall.  It was loud and tight and the guy at the table next to us had on a ball cap.  Not quite the upscale experience I was hoping for on such a special occasion.We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip which we sent back after two bites.  It tasted like someone had dropped the salt shaker in the dish.  When our entrees came we realized that salt was a main ingredient in all the dishes.  My husband's brisket was so salty he couldn't finish it.  The roasted potatoes were the same.  Although cooked perfectly, my filet was bland.  I did enjoy the steak sauce which was needed to add flavor to the steak.  To top the evening off, our coats were misplaced and it took the coat check nearly 10 minutes to locate them.      We like to indulge ourselves on New Year's Eve by going to high end restaurants.  We are willing to pay for the experience.  Although we paid the price at The Barn we did not receive good food or a good experience.  We weren't even able to enjoy the ambiance of The Barn since we were relegated to the bar area all evening.",L H.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,11/18/14,"Not your typical Mitchell's restaurant. For the price, the food is below mediocre. The vegetables we inedible, mainly greasy piles of mush. The drinks were OK if you are a bourbon drinker. If not, there are far better places within a few miles with a much better cocktail collection. The food was unmemorable. I cannot even remember what I ordered but I do remember stating I will not return. Totally not your best foot forward Mr. Mitchell. I wish the food and drink was at least decent, since it is right down the road, but, I'll fight the traffic and crowds at Easton for better food and cocktails.",Jeremy A.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,2010/5/14,"The Barn is a beautiful restaurant (it's seriously stunning. CMR did an amazing job on this one.  Every last detail is perfect) that offers a mouthwatering menu. Unfortunately, they just don't deliver on the food or cocktails. My husband and I tried the soul rolls and the crab cake to start.  The crab cake was very salty. It might have been accidentally finished with salt twice bc I saw a lot of it on the plate. The soul rolls could be / should be their signature app, described on the menu as rolls stuffed with brisket and greens and served with house - made bbq sauce. Because my hopes were so high these were  super disappointing.  There was barely any brisket in them, and I didnt like their bbq sauce.  With our apps we each had a cocktail.  I had the Barn Tea and he had the Hemingway.  Neither were great. We also did their Tennessee, Kentucky, and Rye flight. All were ok, none were great. For our entrees I got the kabobs and hubby got a dry agreed, bone- in steak.  My kabobs came with rice pilaf, and we ordered a loaded baked potato, greens, and succotash to share.  My kabobs were kind of lame but out of everything that we ordered they were exactly what I was expecting.  The pieces of beef were big and were cooked perfectly.  I say the dish is lame bc as a composed plate its just lacking something. I could see this one getting dropped from the menu.  It was served with that same bbq sauce, and came with rice pilaf, which was buttery and very underwhelming.  My husband has had steaks that he's enjoyed more, but thought his steak was good.  I tried a piece, but really shouldn't bother weighing in bc I'm not a huge dry aged beef fan. He commented that it was awkward eating his big steak on the small, oval plate. We agreed that the succotash and potato were good, but we were expecting more. He really liked the greens. I agree they're worth trying.  We were both able to find a wine to pair well with our food. For dessert he ordered the Woodford Reserve Double Wood bourbon, I got a Barn Lemonade, and we shared the coconut cake.  The cake was fantastic. Hubby said he'd go back just for that, and he is not a big dessert guy so that compliment is huge.  It really was the highlight. When out-of-towners come to visit I can see myself taking them to the Barn to show off how well Columbus can pull off rustic elegance.  The trip would be just for drinks though.  We'll have to dine somewhere else.",Lisa D.,,,,,,

The chicken was moist, tender and full of flavor. The breaking was crispy and had a nice flavor to the spices. The creamed spinach was excellent. I did not have cocktails but the ones at our table looked well crafted. The service was attentive but not pushy. I highly recommend this new establishment. The prices are well deserved for the quality of food I would expect from Cameron. I did notice that even the smallest cut of prime rib served at our table was enough to feed two.

Everything is way overpriced and I would rather go to other CM staples. One complaint I have is on the brunch. They NEVER keep the options stocked and it causes you to wait, make multiple trips, or get something you don't really want. My recommendation, save your time and money and go somewhere else.",Megan G.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,10/28/14,"This is, sadly, the first Cameron Mitchell restaurant where I've had a mediocre meal. Went for a night out with my daughter and will give high praise for the service and the Bourbon drinks. The food, however, was overpriced and lacking flavor.The Soul rolls were highly recommended. The problem was the barbecue sauce.It had a strong tomato, almost ketchup-like flavor, and not much seasoning. We mentioned it to our server who remarked it was the house sauce but offered us a pork reduction that was much better.Without thinking, we ordered ribs and brisket. The ribs were tender but covered in the sauce we didn't like. The brisket was overcooked and dry. The macaroni and cheese was tasty, but even as a share, very pricey. I will pay for a good meal, but this was a bit much.The ambiance is pleasant, the staff top notch. Just couldn't get beyond the price and limited quality.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,2005/11/15,"We went for dinner on Saturday night.  We recognized that this restaurant was trying to be a cheaper version of the Ocean Club.  They're definitely a little cheaper but the quality wasn't even close.The highlight of the meal was the onion rings.  They were freshly made and cooked perfectly.  The calamari appetizer tasted more like the batter instead of the fish.Dinner was a big disappointment. The ribs were inedible - overcooked with bones literally breaking apart.  The menu said that the ribs were cooked in their smokehouse.  The only smoke these ribs saw was the steam from the pot of boiling water in which they were cooked.  The prime rib was dry and flavorless, like it had been sitting under a warmer for too long.  The pecan crusted trout was long on pecans and the sauce was indistinct and added nothing but moisture to the dish.The service was very slow with little communication from our server most of the time.  I would recommend either spending the $ to go to Smith & Wollensky, Eddie Merlot's, or Ocean Club or going to a more casual dining spot.  We won't be coming back.",D P.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,5,9/25/14,"Drinks, oh my the whiskey bourbon selection. Nice move CMR. Great concept for a restaurant. Did I mention the atmosphere?! This is one of the best designed restaurant's ever in my opinion. Upscale dining feel inside, with separated areas. The outside has the best in class choices in the city for ""by a fire, OR cigars n scotch area, OR dining with friends outside, OR dining with a party of 20+ outside, OR outside bar people watching area.""... and the best part about this overall design (whomever designed this layout knocked it out of the park) in any one of the area, you somehow feel like you're with just your group of people. You don't have foot traffic past you, if you're at the bar side fore pit. You feel completely separated from the sit down dining experience if you're in the cigar area, and did I mention the corn hole boards by the cigar pit, under shade trees?! C'mon, this is like a dream. The inside bar is cozy, and has a very good feel for drinking Old Fashined's till the night wastes away. The only, only draw back I'd even bring up is that they don't open till 4p. If the could open the indoor bar at 2:30 for an ""end of business day drink/late lunch meeting"" that would be ideal. Well, we aren't done yet - since this is Yelp, and I haven't talked about the food or drinks yet. Wow. This is the best CMR concept I've ever been to. So the drink list is just perfect for whiskey mixing and taste testing. The Old Fashioned was very good (offer a choice of bitters maybe?), and the Hemingway was spot on, as was the Tea with mint sprig which nailed the outdoor dining experience to a ""t"". Ouch, bad humor. LOL. The citrus was my least favorite, but not bad, just a different option amongst the other drinks. Then we finally get to some food. Oyster's on the half were well priced and delicious. They went perfectly with drinks and conversation by the fire pit (FYI - WiFi was weak outside). The onion rings were spot with seasoning, batter application and doneness. Next trip back, I'll actually try a sit down dinner, since this time turned into drinks n apps by the fire pit and wasted the night away :)Bottom line - go any time (after 4p), with anyone, for any reason. This place truly has something for everyone.",Tony B.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,2011/5/14,"I'm giving this a 3 out of 5 for one reason.  The way they run their reservations.

However there were plenty of open tables from the time I arrived and finished dining.  I suggest you go to a manager and insist on a time.  I should have.  They really do have adequate seating. I give their food and service a 4 star.  The baked onion was fabulous and so was the prime rib and wine. A bit loud but the food quality and service made up for it.

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,2003/2/16,"I have been to the Barn 3 times now.  Twice for appetizers and drinks and once for dinner last Saturday Feb 27th.   The drinks are expensive, but well worth it.  Appetizers are a good value on happy hour.  Entrees on the other hand are overpriced for what you get.  I paid $45 for a 14oz bone in NY strip and baked potato.  The steak was average at best.  The first half of the steak was chewy.  The second half was more tender, but the steak lacked flavor overall.  My wife got the pot roast which was $32.  The portion was small, the vegetables overcooked and over salted.    Do not go to this Cameron Mitchell location for dinner.  There are several Cameron Mitchell restaurants that we like including Ocean Club, Cap City and Marcella's.  If you want a good steak for a good price go to Longhorn and order the Porterhouse for 2 for $44.  You get a 30oz steak that is delicious, and 2 sides per person.",Norm L.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,2006/10/15,"So, I didn't write about my experience at The Barn yet?  How can this be??  Fortunately, I remember what I ordered and how I felt about it all. I harassed by husband about going here since it opened, and he finally decided to take me--during Lent.  This is a problem, b/c I gave up alcohol for Lent, so was unable to try a cocktail.  My husband ordered one and thought it was great.  As you may have heard/seen, they're big on the bourbon at The Barn.  In short, Food:  delicious.  Service: not up to par w/Cameron Mitchell standards.  Atmosphere: hit or miss.  Hit because it looks cool in there, but miss because the tables are too close.  Impossible to have a private conversation.  So, now for details:  I ordered Barbecue Chicken: chicken pieces drenched with delicious barbecue sauce (which I no longer see on the menu for some reason--upsetting!).  Loved it.  The sauce was almost pink--sounds weird, but tasted wonderful.  It was sweet, tangy, and just right.  It came with a side of greens, which were just awful.  I was very surprised at how bad they were--incredibly bitter & yucky. Not salt nor butter could save them.  I want to say that the other side was mashed potatoes--if I'm correct, they were very good.  Since I was saving money by not ordering a cocktail, I got a wedge salad.  Huge. Creamy.  Delightful.  Fattening.  Needless to say, some of my favorite things.  My husband wanted the Oysters Bingo appetizer, and I allowed it, only because they were covered in cream and cheese.  (I'm not a huge seafood fan).  I couldn't tell that they were oysters because they were drowning in aioli, but that was fine by me--each oyster was like a mini, creamy casserole.  Since I had an appetizer, [fattening] salad, and a good-sized entree, I had plenty of my entree left over to take home.  The server did box up the greens for me, and I proceeded to throw them in the trash when I got home (where somehow, they stunk up the whole house immediately, though they were in a box which was wrapped and buried in the trash!).  Ah, the server.  He was odd.  I'm not sure if one of his beloved pets passed away (not making fun--I know how difficult it is) or he just has a boring personality, but he was incredibly stiff.  He wasn't bad, but he wasn't good.  I would go back here for the food (no greens, though, please) and to try a cocktail.  However, it's pretty far away from us, and I think my husband is only too happy--he doesn't like to drop tons of money on food, anyway.  (He's more of a Skyline kind of guy--another thing he enjoys that I hate--again, opposites attract).  I only wore him down because we received a $100 gift card from his parents for Christmas for any Cameron Mitchell restaurant.  And get this--our bill was $100.25 (before tip).  With all of the food we got? (husband also got French Onion soup, which he loved)--not bad at all.  Service needs to be better.  Bring back the barbecue chicken.  And for goodness' sake, get rid of the greens for good!",Anna H.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,5/25/15,"Please understand, I am a HUGE Cameron Mitchell fan. I was so let down with the barn. There were some good things and I will close the review with those but for the disappointments:1.) I went on a Tuesday evening around 6:00. Was not busy. I walked in, stood at the hostess stand for 2 minutes before being greeted. This would be totally acceptable if the hostess/hostesses were busy with other guest. Not the case. They both were talking to each other with their backs turned to the door. I finally excused myself and asked if this was the correct please to be to be seated. They apologized and walked me to a table. 2.) I was greeted with by a loud, borderline arrogant/obnoxious server. Went on and on about the bourbons and wine selection. So I decided to try a blend that was specially aged for The Barn. Was told they didn't have that in stock and went on a ramble about why, none of which I care. The point is it was advertised top left corner of the menu, first place you look and the server touted it. But, we are out? What? Out? You just recommended it?3.) food was the quality of fast food. 4.) server was loud and obnoxious. Will never spend another dollar here",Mighty M.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,2/27/15,"This was my second trip to The Barn and so far it has not lived up to Cameron Mitchell's standards.  On both visits the ""loaded"" baked potato came out less than piping hot with the ""loaded"" ingredients congealed on top - so the tater WAS hot once, just not at the time it was served.  This is an easy fix, so it's unusual to have happened twice.  Also, on both visits either a guest or I had the prime rib and ordered real horseradish instead of the sauce, and both times the entree was delivered without it.  There was also an awful smelling fish/seafood dish served while we were in the bar.  Several patrons commented on it but the guy who ordered it devoured it!The prime rib and steaks were cooked to perfection and served at the proper temperature.  The selection of bourbons was phenomenal and the wine list superb. As a bourbon specialty joint I couldn't believe they didn't have a bourbon-barrel ale or stout.  Seemed a natural offering for this place.  Our service when we dined at the bar was much better than when we had a table.  I believe a waiter was being trained, so no biggie there.I would give The Barn 2.5 stars if it were an option, but they are closer to 3 stars at this time than 2.  Given their relatively new status, I fully anticipate the service and any food issues to be resolved quite shortly and up to the Cameron Mitchell level we all expect from him.  I will give it a few more months and try again before I decide if this is going to be a ""regular"" stop or not.",Bob G.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,10/27/14,"Went back again, ordered the brisket.  It was on the rare side and fatty.  I'm used to brisket being cooked all the way through from the smoking/cooking process.  Generally I like it when the fat is cooked off.   This didn't hit the spot for me.  This place is my go to for a drink, but I continue to be disappointed in the restaurant side.",Craig O.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,1/30/15,"For all the hype about this place it was a true disappointment. After being seatedit was way over an hour before we saw our food. The filet was cut at the table and shared. The knife they tried it cut it would probably would not have cut butter. I was scared it was headed for the floor. The entire meal was so salty that it was incredible. Yes there is something odd about the butter but could not figure out what it was. The place was extremely noisy and I felt as if we were screaming just to have a conversation at our table. For the experience I felt it was way over priced. Would haverather spent my money some place else.",A W.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,10/31/14,"We were a party of 9.  The service was friendly and professional.  The food, on the other hand, was very mediocre.  The Waldorf Salad was probably the worst I have ever tasted.  The apples were fresh, but that;s where it ended.  It was bland and tasteless.  The ribs felt as if they had come out of the microwave.  A few of us had ordered the ribs and the person next to me had a much larger slab with char on it and the one in front of me (although we both ordered the same) was a smaller version and looked smothered in BBQ sauce with not a touch of char on it.  At least serve consistent food, even if its only mediocre. The apple pie dessert was good.  Final verdict: not one bit worth the price you pay.  Go to Cap City instead!!",J M.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,10/19/14,"We love Cameron Restaurants.  Let's start at the beginning:  We arrived for a 6:30 reservation at 6:10.  Were told they would text my number when table was ready.  6:45 a waitress come over and asked if we needed a drink.  I politely said yes and you can bring us a free one every 10 minutes until our table reserved for 6:30 is ready.  She came back and said your table has been ready for quite some time.  Well thank you for that one!  strike one.We were jammed into a table in the middle of the restaurant where you had to squeeze by the tables around you.  Very close quarters and very loud.  Strike two.Drink service OK.  For four people they brought two rolls.  Placed an order for an appetizer.  Waitress came back to take our order,  appetizer not here yet, we ordered.  I ordered Salmon.  Wanted to order a baked potato but our waitress said there were potatoes on the side.  My wife ordered Strip steak  and our friends ordered Salmon and Brisket..One of our parties salad arrived before the appetizer.  Appetizer arrived tough bbq shrimp.  Did have good flavor.  Ball one.Water glasses empty.  Our food arrives.  My friend gets a nice looking cut of Salmon.  I love and eat Salmon very frequently, and they bring me the tail.  Barely 1/3 inch thick.  As for potatoes there were 3 small roasted wedges mixed with veggies.  My friend got two roasted potatoes.  My wife ordered her steak medium rare.  It came medium, and was under seasoned and tough.  Our other friend ordered brisket.  Extremely salty and dry.  Strike 3.  At this point I just wanted to get up and leave.  We had way too much invested.  It took long enough to get our food so why ask for replacement.  Half way through the meal still no water or waitress.  Hey we need some water over here.  The floor manager came by and I politely reviewed our experience.  He took 13 dollars off my bill and none off our friends.  It was my birthday so they did give us a mud pie that was outstanding.  This restaurant is OUT. of our plans for anytime in the future unless they get rid of their kitchen and floor managers.  123. dollars later we left feeling like we had been robbed.  One STAR for the dessert.",Gerard K.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,4,4/18/15,We ate there for the first time in the service was wonderful they got us I n right away even though it was busy they have a wonderful patio with a cover food was very very good I had the trout that was fabulous and fried chicken which was very good desserts or something you need to try,Elroy M.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,2005/9/16,"The place looks lively and classic. Lighting a bit too dark for my taste however. And we arrived early to sit on the patio, on a lovely evening and it was closed!? Anyway, we were a party of 6 and were seated in a party type room. Kind of disappointing as we couldn't experience the ambience of the restaurant, nor could we scope out other diners food, sometimes that helps with my own order decision. The menu is large and varied, you can get out of there with a more reasonable tab if you order appetizers or one of the sandwiches. Still, everything is just a few bucks more than most places. The entrees only came with one side, even the 45$ steak. They want you to choke up another 6 or 7 $ for additional sides. The  crab cake appetizer was pricey, but it came with two crab cakes, which the menu only said ""cake"", so my Dad and I totally over ordered. However, my main complaint is the style of service. Long winded explainations with every question, and long menu descriptions before even taking a drink order. I don't think it is slow getting food or drink from the bar or kitchen, I think staff are instructed to treat the place like a high end seakhouse experience, where people want to spend 2 or three hours at dinner, and have long frilly descriptions of everything. We just stopped asking and ordered. We had a 530 reservation and left at 830. My poor old Dad just got up and left. I don't know if I would go back. Maybe to sit at the bar and have an appetizer. There are just too many more places in columbus where the food and the prices are great.",Marty S.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,5/14/15,"There is a lot to love here from the location, to the service, to the food, but stay away from the poor attempt at BBQ. I should probably have been warned off after the server told us that brisket was removed from the menu for quality issues, but I went with the ribs anyway. The portion was plentiful and prepared competently, but the recipe just doesn't work. It is typical of everything that is wrong with restaurant BBQ. Tender meat, but no smoky flavor, and covered in a sweet, character-less sauce. We got fried chicken for our toddler on recommendation from other reviewers and that is the way to go. I am generally skeptical of high-praise heaped on fried chicken, but in this case the kudos are well-deserved. The chicken was moist, very flavorful and not oily at all. My wife also raved about her salmon dish. You probably can't go wrong as long as you stay away from the BBQ. We did desert and thought that the house-comped mud pie (celebrating an event for my wife) was huge and had some high-points (crunchy crust, pops of fresh peanut butter throughout), but is not something we would order again.",Corey S.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,9/25/14,"I took my grandma for dinner last night. She might be the one person more critical of places than me. I had been to this location many many times when it was Hoggy's, so I had a comparison. The place struck me as New Albany in every way. The dÌ©cor is very confusing but nice. Deep massive chairs with wheels are great for a living room, but not for a nice dinner. Everything is very upscale designed, despite being inside a barn (very New Albany). I can tell how hard they are going for the refined yet rustic look (very New Albany). Food and drink prices are just crazy high for a place playing country music. Servers wear jeans and plaid shirts, yet a steak is $50. I would say it's half way between Hyde Park and a Big Boy type of feel, but that sounds really bad. We were seated in the bar area without asking for it, but that was fine. I had a Caesar side salad and the salmon entrÌ©e. I could tell that there was nothing remotely healthy about this place, so I asked for the butter on the side. I did receive the butter on the side, but the veggies and salmon were literally drenched to the point of being soggy with oil/butter. Salad was also soggy with dressing. Upscale healthy is something deeply missing from this city. That being said, it was good food independent of the price. I'll always pay more to get quality food. They aren't even pretending to offer organic or grass-fed anything though...The service was crazy slow, and it was only 5:45pm. I could tell they were trying, and it was probably the kitchen that was behind. I would give it 4 stars potentially in the future. In summary, after growing up in Gahanna, this place just is overly trying to capture the rural farm/million-dollar estate weird combo feel that is New Albany, catering to very wealthy people who want to pretend they live on a rural farm while paying someone to cut their grass. Cameron Mitchell restaurants in general have slipped pretty far in my opinion from the smaller heyday. I feel like all the places of his that I've visited in the past couple years are just a step above average enough to remain popular. And by the way, the address is Gahanna, not New Albany. Stop trying so hard, please.",Chris M.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,2012/6/14,"If I could do no stars I would - All I can say this can not be a Cameron Mitchell's  restaurant !!! I'm a regular at ocean club - I went there 3 different times to give it a fair shot!! Consistently bad service, bad food and the manager does not know how to handle when a customer complains. He is like he was a manager before at Macdonalds or something not a pricey medium to high price restaurant. When you have bartenders measuring every pour it looks very amateur. It's obvious they made a Hugh mistake - by not hiring a very experience staff from cooks, waiters, bar tenders and especially management horrible. The last time I was there I waited 1 hour and 15 mins for my dinner and in that time we asked 3 times the bartender where is our meals she keep saying the manager us looking into. Final 1 hour and 15 mins later the macdonalds manager came over and said I do not know when your meals coming we asked is it 10 mins, 20 or 5 mins and he couldn't give us an answer while he was talking with us he had to leave us and hug and shake one if his buddies hand good bye!! not apologising or anything just that they were busy!! Lol macdonald's manager didn't even say I'll pay your bill or a gift card for another visit!! Terrible would be an understatement of our 3 experiences there!!!",Karen C.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,2010/1/14,"Have always been a huge fan of Cameron Mitchell Restaurants as they typically excel in all areas.  The barn is a very nice venue with good service and good food.  My issue is that they are really stretching their pricing at the same time I felt I was only getting very good food when I am used to getting great food at their places.  Ribs were just ok but would never order them again.  You can get better ribs at several other area restaurants for much less.  The filet was prepared correctly but for $48 without any sides I didn't feel like I can't wait to go back.  The dining room wasn't for me.  A loud, open room with tables crammed.  The bar had a much better feel for me as did the patio.  I will go back for the atmosphere and location but was disappointed to see good food being served at phenomenal pricing.  I don't mind paying a premium as it is usually worth the expense but not here.  I felt like I was being asked to pay for all of their current and recent expansion.",Harley H.,,,,,,

The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,2011/5/14,"I frequent Cameron Mitchell restaurants and for the most part enjoy my experience. I was looking forward to ""The Barn"" since it is not far from where I live and I like BBQ. Even though it's Cameron Mitchell and the bugs should be worked out in advance, it is newly opened. So, I can excuse sitting in the small waiting area for 15 minutes past my reservation while people seemed to be walking in the door and getting seated immediately. I can excuse them forgetting to bring our salads (we got a free dessert for this slight). I can excuse the high prices. What I can't excuse is the food. I ordered the Rib combo, half rack of ribs + 6oz. beef brisket $32!!! It came with cole slaw. The ribs were tough and neither of the meats had any smoky flavor. The BBQ sauce tasted like doctored catsup. I was so disappointed. I thought if Cameron Mitchell was going to do BBQ it would be great. It was bad. He should go to Texas or one of the Carolinas to find out how it is done. My daughter had an 8oz filet $39!!! It was tasty and cooked properly. The venue is beautiful and large with a big bar area and a nice outdoor area. I hope he can find out how to do BBQ as it seems to be the theme.",Pat M.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,2,9/26/14,"""This long awaited opening proved to be full of disappointments. Went for dinner and we were braced for the prices and fully expected to have excellent dining experience. Decor was nice, staff friendly, food--not so good. Ordered full rack of ribs--homage to Hoggys-- these were probably the toughest ribs I've ever had to cut through. Manager came over and asked how they were and I had to come clean and tell him about my disappointment in them..  He made good on them and replaced them with very good brisket.   Salmon salad was also ordered--salmon was perfect -greens were lack-luster.  This place has potential to be an excellent restaurant but for these prices we expected more than mediocrity.  Will try to give the another chance but in the future will probably just dine in the bar and order the Oysters Bingo (which were awesome) and the Onion Rings (also awesome).",D R.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,10/13/14,I had high expectations for a Cameron Mitchell restaurant as we are new to Columbus and have heard his venues are top notch. While the atmosphere was very nice it is extremely noisy but a great place to people watch. I really liked the diversity of offerings from high end steaks to home style recipes.  I had the roast chicken with stuffing and vegetables- very flavorful and the portion was plentiful. The service was very friendly but a bit on the slow side; not a problem if you want to relax and pace yourself. You have to try the chocolate cake- it was incredible! This is a pricey restaurant especially if you order some dinners where the side dishes are at an extra cost. All in all it is a good restaurant but in my opinion not phenomenal.,Edward E.,,,,,,

My steak was cooked to perfection and it came with their steak sauce which puts it over the top. I also had their mushrooms and onions, they were caramelized just right and melted in my mouth. My friend had the fried chicken was she loved it came with Mac and cheese which is casserole style and was great. We both had plenty of leftovers for homer I then had the pecan pie which was delicious and she had the coconut cake which I am defiantly getting next time. Overall everything was fantastic.

They're hands-down the best in food quality, service and atmosphere. Sadly ""The Barn"" is the polar opposite. First we got seated in their semi-outdoor area and the heaters above was very uncomfortable and it was an odd and terrible environment. When we got moved inside it took 15 minutes before we got water with no server to be found, we got another server to fill our glasses and what an attitude she had too and very aggressive with the water pitcher. When the server did show up, not even an introduction or an apology as I had to ask where our server was at. Then drinks took another 30 minutes to arrive. So overall it was almost an hour before we got drinks. Then we proceeded to the dinner order, she didn't bother to come around to my side to take my order, I had to shout across the table and guest to give my order. When we got our food the steaks were overdone as it was requested med-rare, my Prime Rib was med to med-well as I requested it to be med-rare originally. It was a very frustrating night as our expectation was high. More than likely we will not return and quite disappointed how bad the service and training is...total time was a mind numbing 3 hours long!!!",R M.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,1,2010/2/15,"My wife and I go to many Cameron Mitchell restaurants locally and nationally when we are at home in columbus and when we travel. We usually have great meals except for our recent trip to the Barn. We sat at the bar and ordered off the menu. My wife and I split their steak sandwich with a side of veggies, and an order of onion rings which the bartenders spoke highly of.  Maybe it was an off night, but, the steak sandwich was probably the worst Cameron Mitchell served meal we experienced.  Even the bartender shared with us that the other Cameron restaurants had better sandwiches. The steak was dried out, and not appetizing at all. We were completely shocked that they served it. Especially with no au jus. The onion rings had a unique batter as described by the bartender and I think they were sitting around the kitchen a little longer than it should have. I think they could have done a better job with the presentation.  They seemed to be thrown on a plate quickly, sat for a while in the kitchen and served when someone had time.  Plus, the meal and drinks were expensive too.",Len K.,,,,,,
The Barn at Rocky Fork Creek,215,3.5,3,9/24/14,"My first impression:  amazing building and space and smells nice and woody.  Decorations are welcoming and warm. However, once you get over the glamour and glitz of the new building, reality sets in.  For instance, once we were seated we waited 20 minutes without being approached by a server.  We finally flagged down a manager who took our drink order and apologized.  Comped our drinks which was nice.  Prices for food are high for what you get.  Smallest wedge salad I had ever seen for 6 bucks and I could only eat half as it was drowning in way too much dressing.  As someone else mentioned before, these are Ocean Club prices without Ocean Club presentation or food type/quality.  Closer to Cap City than Ocean Club as far as food goes. For example, French fries are, I'm pretty certain, Ore-Ida steak fries. They need to be sassed up a little bit.  Wine list by the bottle is stupid expensive.  I mean STUPID expensive. So expensive, I would never contemplate ordering a bottle.  I desperately want this restaurant to succeed here but I think once the newness wears off, people aren't going to want to pay those high prices on a random Tuesday.",K M.,,,,,,

First of all, I have yet to meet a Cameron Mitchell Restaurant I didn't like. This one has a unique feel. Obviously with ""diner"" in the title, it kind of takes you back to the 1950s era. They have a great menu filled with items that make you feel like you're right back at home in ma's kitchen! I have gotten the burger here before but I would not recommend it. Burger alone would get this place a solid three. It was just very dry, not much flavor, too big of a patty. But luckily I learned from that and progressed on to other dishes. I will say the balsamic chicken is excellent! Probably the best menu item there. It comes with delicious mashed potatoes. Made me feel like I was eating a home cooked meal. Another guest I was with also got the chicken pot pie once and said it was excellent...looked very hearty and delicious! After your meal you have to save room for the chocolate peanut butter pie! I've gotten it every time I've went and it never disappoints.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2011/1/17,"As a lifelong University of Michigan fan, it physically pains me to say anything complimentary about the city of Columbus. Good food has a tendency to bridge any rivalry or discord though, and Cap City unequivocally delivers in that respect.This place was bustling on a Wednesday night. I had a nice exchange with the greeters, where they strongly recommended the blue cheese chips for a shared appetizer, and the pecan crusted pork-chops as a dinner entree. Sold.The blue cheese is mixed with an alfredo-like sauce and scallions and then drizzled over freshly cut potato chips. Super rich and not for the cholesterol-conscious, but damn, they were good.As delish as the chips were, the pork chops stole the show. With your order comes two hunks of grilled chops, crusted with chopped pecans that offer a balance of both sweet and crunchy texture with the savoriness of the meat. The mashed potato and spinach sides were solid, but in this case, you won't need to pay much attention to the supporting cast.My boss and I split the banana pudding was which also decisively good. And when the bill came, our server very generously took off the aforementioned dessert (we had mentioned early on this was our first trip to Cap City). From beginning to end, I had nothing short of a great experience, even if I was in the heart of Buckeye country (sighhhh).",Christopher H.,,,,,,

So, I have tried numerous area establishments during my visits, and have always had Cap City on the radar but never acted on it until last night.  And now, Cap City is on my list of places I have to have every time I'm in town.We were fortunate enough to make it before the rain, before happy hour ended, and before it got slammed.  We sat at the outside bar area and had Michael as our server/bartender, and he was fantastic!  Attentive but not overbearing, made great recommendations, and was always there when we needed refills.We started with a pepperoni flatbread ($5 during HH), a smoked salmon dip ($7) and shared a pretzel w/ beer cheese ($6).  Everything was tasty, and the smoked salmon dip so much so that I ordered a second helping!  With no room for a full meal, we felt more than satisfied with the portion sizes, the taste quality, and the bang for our bucks.  At the end, my colleague had a little room left for their deep dish apple pie, which just as everything else, came out in a HUGE portion with vanilla bean ice cream.  I didn't partake, but my colleague said it was heavenly.Michael filled us in on the history of Cap City and the various other restaurants in the Columbus area that are owned by the same family.  Cap City, keep it up...amazing is the only way I can describe our experience!",Phil P.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2007/8/17,"The food at Cap City Fine Diner looks better than it actually tastes. However, I have to give them credit for their service. All of our food was cold when served. I am not that type of person who usually complains but since the server asked...I told him about it. It happened when we already finished the food. I am not sure who that is someone looks to be the restaurant manager came and addressed the issue. Quite appreciated at heart that they take customer's word seriously as this is what it really should be.The restaurant gets packed so easily and the parking space could be limited. Thankfully we had an early dinner that day so wasn't quite impacted. I am not sure if they take reservation but I do recommend that if they do because lots of people were waiting outside when we finished.For appetizer, we ordered the Blue Cheese Potato Chips (4/5). It came with scallion and alfredo sauce. I was glad that we were sharing because it did taste great initially but it's that type of food once you have too much you just don't feel great eating it. You know how Blue cheese is...! Appetizer bread looked yummy but tasted pretty average to me. For entrees, we had Pecan Crusted Pork Chop (3.5/5). It wasn't bad - the pork was really tender. However, it was just way too sweet and our food was served cold so the taste probably got downgraded. I personally recommend the pork chop at 101 beer kitchen - great price and deliciously and juicy. Cap City Diner meatloaf (3/5) was also just an okay... I wasn't quite impressed. My favorite part of the meal was the dessert. We got the Seriously Big Chocolate Cake (4.5/5)! Very good flavor and not overly sweet at least for me personally. If you care a lot of the food taste in general, I am not sure how much would you really enjoy here. But if it's just for a meal in a normal day, this place will work fine. Desserts are recommend. Be aware of the portion...everything is huge here and can definitely be shared by at least two people!",Mirabelle L.,,,,,,

The ""fine diner"" concept is super cute - Cap City has a diner feel while still being incredibly classy. FiancÌ© picked me up from the airport and said he was in the mood for mashed potatoes. I did a search for potatoes on our route home, and we ended up here. Food was excellent and definitely hit the spot. We had the strawberry basil lemonade and the peach drink, both were fantastic though I preferred the lemonade. FiancÌ© described the pretzel we ordered at ""probably the best pretzel I've ever had"". I ordered he spicy chicken rigatoni, and or waitress suggested substituting the grilled chicken with the Romano crusted chicken. UM YES EXCELLENT IDEA THE CRUSTED CHICKEN WAS PERFECT AND AMAZING PLEASE TAKE HER ADVICE PEOPLE. FiancÌ©'s mashed potatoes were up to standard, and we can't wait to eat our leftovers tomorrow.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,10/24/17,"This is literally my first review, so be patient folks. I've been to Cap City before, but it has been 3 or 4 years since I've been back. The initial experience was fine, but I remember thinking it was slightly over priced. This experience was much different...My gf and I stopped in on a Tuesday night and the place was jamming. It was around 7pm and we were surprisingly seated right away. Our server was prompt and very friendly. I ordered the meat loaf dinner and my gf had the reuben and a side salad. The food came out very quickly and everything was very good. The meatloaf isn't the best I've ever had, but it is a strong 7.8/10. The reuben was impressive with a nice portion of meat. We decided to splurge and ordered the pb/chocolate pie. Very very good. Overall, the Cap City was very good and we will for sure be back. It was not near as expensive as I remembered either. I actually felt like it was fairly priced for the portions and quality of food. Enjoy!",Danny E.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2003/6/17,"Cap City Fine Diner and Bar is a Columbus classic! It was one of the first local restaurants I ate at when I first moved to Columbus and has been a favorite of mine ever since. It is the most affordable and casual Cameron Mitchell Restaurant, but you experience an extraordinary level of service and attention to detail from your servers. Although more upscale than your typical diner, Cap City still offers the blue plate specials like Liver and Onions, Chicken Pot Pie, Pot Roast, BBQ Ribs and Beef Stroganoff.  If it is your first time dining here, you must try the Cap City Diner Meatloaf! The meatloaf is PHENOMENAL!!! Actually, it is the BEST meatloaf I have ever eaten. The meatloaf is served on top of toast with buttermilk-chive mashed potatoes and chili onion rings and drizzled with an amazing BBQ gravy. It is the ultimate comfort food dish!Besides offering the best meatloaf, Cap City also has the BEST desserts in Columbus. If you have a sweet tooth, you must try the Seriously Big Chocolate Cake. Its title doesn't lie...it is the world's largest piece of chocolate cake! The Big Cup O' Chocolate, which is a mug of warm, double chocolate lava cake topped with Johnson's Triple Vanilla Bean ice cream, is equally as large and delicious as the cake. If you can't tell already, all of the portions are very generous and can be split...I highly recommend splitting the desserts if you don't want to end up in a sugar coma. As with any diner, you receive classic comfort food dishes. But unlike other diners, you will be left wanting to return for the showstopper-sized desserts and outstanding service.",Emily F.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,11/19/16,"I was told by my friend who used to live out here that I had to eat here or my business trip would be a wasted one. He told me that I had to have the chicken wings so we came here on our last day before flying home. For starters, we ordered the tamarind glazed chicken wings and the hot and sour calamari. Let me tell you, the chicken wings did not disappoint. It is served with celery sticks and a dipping sauce. The wings were marinated and tossed in a sauce that was tangy and sweet with a hint of heat. It was so flavorfully addicting, that if I didn't stop eating the wings, I wouldn't have room for my entree. I can almost say the same thing about the calamari. The calamari is lightly friend, tossed with the other ingredients, and then served on a bed of fried rice noodles. This was very tasty as well but I liked the wings more.For my main entree, I ordered the pan-seared ribeye (medium rare of course). It was served with a twice-baked potato cake topped with garlic butter and steamed broccoli. My ribeye was perfectly seared medium rare. It was a very high quality cut of meat and not a lower grade quality of meat. One of my other coworkers ordered the ribeye and was as pleased with his as I was with mine. My other coworker ordered the romano crusted chicken that was served fried on top of garlic buttered noodles and a tomato cream sauce. She was happy with it as well.I am glad that my friend recommended this restaurant to us. We came about 40 minutes before closing time on a Thursday night so it was quiet. I've heard that this is a really popular place that gets packed. Coming from California, I can't say that we have many so-called fine diners that serve such delicious food for a reasonable price.

There was also a Fried Fish Sandwich that was ordered that I was able to take a bite of; it was rather tasty.

We had a pretzel and their famous chips for appetizer- pretzel I wouldn't recommend and the chips were different but I could only eat a few before the taste got to me. I ordered the Romano crusted chicken- large portion but still not worth the price. The taste got to me again and I could only eat some of the chicken. For dessert we tried the chocolate layered cake (meh...not very moist or flavorful), chocolate PB pie (good but nothing special) and the apple pie (didn't taste home made but not awful).

If you're hungrier than that, the meatloaf or the pork chop looks incredibly inviting on every visit. My favorite time to come is brunch. Eggs on hash or diner steak and eggs will fill you up all day, and the cinnamon rolls are a delicious way to kick off your meal. Pleasant atmosphere, consistently good service, and a solid drink list all help to make every trip to Cap City enjoyable. Good place for kids too.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,8/15/16,"Cap City Diner is my favorite CM restaurant. It's a classic throwback with upscale flair that works. The ambiance of CCD can hinge on where you are seated. Near the door, the decor is bright retro diner/soda fountain. There is a large round bar area which is more classy/elegant, less lighting and dark wood. It reminds me a lot of the Clarmont's lounge area back in the day. The main dining room is open, spacious and clean lines. They also have plenty of patio space, which feels garden-chic or casual, depending on where you are. If you're bringing someone for the first time, make a seating request when you make your reservation.The other thing - the wait times here during busy times (Friday nights, Sunday brunch, etc.) mean reservations are a necessity. I've not had trouble at happy hour times during the week, but the wait can exceed an hour on Sundays. Make a reservation, avoid hanger.ANYWAY. Onto the food. CCD keeps the good parts of the diner experience (larger portions, lots of carbs, traditional flavors, and classic desserts) and refines them into something ""better"" rather than ""bigger."" From meatloaf to crab cakes to wedge salad to pecan-crusted pork chops to glazed salmon - the preparation speaks to attention rather than assembly-line. No grease puddles or mushy anything. That I can get behind if I'll be eating a dish for three days (yes, they can be that big).Definitely plan to take a doggie bag home, because you will regret not ordering dessert here. This is where Cap City gets the fourth star from me. (Almost) grandma-level, icebox style diner favorites. Again, nicely balanced - if it is supposed to be sweet, it is - not overbearing, though. You can split the desserts among three people, but you'll really want to try more than one. Back to the other things...they have happy hour, and spending an hour or so on the patio with a drink and appetizer is relaxing. They do have Sunday brunch, but I'm a bigger fan of their regular menu items (and the service on Sundays...maybe it is the customers that change it from fun to frantic). Definitely a place to bring your parents/children/spouse when they refuse to eat a) healthy and b)fancy.",Donna O.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,7/18/15,"I read a lot about Cap City's meatloaf on Yelp and was eager to try the dish. I am a fan of Cameron Mitchell's restaurants in general and I've only had excellent experiences at his other restaurants. I was expecting no less from Cap City Diner. However, this was a case of expectations exceeding reality. Overall, I was disappointed with their meatloaf dish. Cap City does get an A for presentation though. It is an impressive plate of meatloaf topped with mashed potatoes and fried onions reaching almost half a foot in height.Taste-wise however, I found the dish to be lacking. To be honest, I think I prefer Boston Market meatloaf. Especially for $17.50, I was expecting some sort of twist on the classic or at least more flavor. I found the BBQ gravy to be a little bland and overly sweet. My favorite part of the dish was probably the mashed potatoes. I could also do without the broccoli.My buddy ordered the pork dish and said it was excellent. Judging from other reviews, that's also another popular dish at Cap City Diner. I'll be back to give Cap City another shot, I just will not be ordering the meatloaf again.***3.5 stars***",Arvid Y.,,,,,,

People were casual to dressy in attire, which made me unsure if I was dressed appropriately. I think other things made up for this, but I think I'd still rate it as just over 3 stars. I also had to deduct some points for it being difficult to find with lacking signage in front. I circled the block 3 times before finding the place!If you're going on a weekend, I definitely recommend this because the place was PACKED when we left (we reserved for 5 pm, so it was just starting to fill in when we arrived). There's also limited parking spots and the whole lot was totally full with people parking where there weren't actually any spots marked.I ordered off the gluten free menu (I have to be gluten free due to celiac), which I requested when I made the reservation. Had no issues with receiving my meal and ate safely! We ordered the shrimp cocktail starter - Yum! The girl child did not care for the legs still being on them, though. I ordered a Ruben on a gluten free sandwich roll with jalapeno coleslaw on the side. The sandwich was quite good, could have used a little more dressing. The coleslaw wasn't really spicy at all, but did have good flavor. My dining companions (boyfriend and his daughter) ordered a burger and a meat loaf sandwich, which they both quite enjoyed.If we were back in the area and wanted a solid gluten-free dining spot and could make reservations in advance, we would definitely return.",Lindsey W.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,2,2002/12/17,I took my family to cap city for lunch cause we love all the other cameron Mitchell's restaurant..sorry to say it was very disappointing..I order the club sandwich with no mayo when it came it had mayo on..i told the server about it he looked at me and said r u sure..i said yes i am and the sandwich came on it  with 1 piece ham and 1 piece turkey..the sandwich cost almost 14 dollar..my husband had the omelette and it said that it is served with 4 eggs ..the omelette was cold and small..disappointment for being one of cameron Mitchell's.,Lil G.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,5/16/17,Service was fast and friendly. Tried the Reuben. Was very fresh and clean. Tasted great. Not the best out there but worth it.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2003/5/17,"Came here with colleagues during a recent biz trip. Cap City was recommended by clients, who raved about the Pecan Crusted Pork Chops and Margaritas with ginger so - off we went. First impressions: popular place with very crowded (and minimal) parking. Without a reservation, 6:30pm arrival guaranteed a 30 minute-ish wait, but the bar had some spots open, and the drinks (French Quarters and the aforementioned Margarita) made the wait fly by. Menu was a little surprising. What's with all the Maryland dishes in Ohio. Not knocking this; I'm from Maryland, so I'll even put Old Bay on pancakes! We ordered Mussels and Blue Cheese Potato Chips as shared apps, with the pork chops to follow. Mussels were plump, perfectly cooked, and beautifully flavored. The chips were far better than I expected: the sauce was wonderfully creamy, blue cheese flavor was not overwhelming, and the chips were hot and still crisp. Portion size was more than adequate for three hungry folks to share...... and then the Pork Chops came out. Two large Bone-in chops on a bed of cheddar-chipotle mashed potatos, served with a spinach side. I had ordered mine rare (in line with the latest USDA regulations), and they were perfectly cooked: juicy and flavorful. The pecan topping complemented the pork without being too sweet.  Overall very, very good, but it could have used a bit more salt and pepper for ""pop"". After stuffing ourselves, all three of us took home one chop, a pile of potatos, and a decent serving of spinach. In my case, this became a really good breakfast the next day.So, I'll deduct a star for poor parking, but give top marks for the food and drinks and service. And yes indeedie, I will come back the next time I'm in Columbus!",Randy R.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,5/21/17,"Wow. Today was my first time here and I wish I'd come much sooner. The service was amazing- from the second we walked in until we left. Everyone was so kind and courteous. The food was amazing as well. The menu itself is full of options that all sound delicious. I ordered the French toast that comes with berries, lemon custard and bacon. Very delicious. The best part was how fast the food came on a hungry Sunday. I can't wait to come back!",Alexa M.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2009/11/16,Every time I've gone here the food has always been outstanding. One of the few places I've never had even the smallest of issues.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2001/5/16,"Cap City is a classic Cameron Mitchell restaurant, and they have been a staple in Columbus for over 20 years now. They have a wonderful menu, an awesome happy hour, and a good location in terms of highway access and being close enough to downtown without being in the middle of the chaos (there is an actual parking lot!). I will say that the restaurant could be about twice the size it is today and it would still be crazy busy. Do not expect to walk in and be seated right away, even with a small party. I personally would recommend reservations, especially for dinner, and even still, I have experienced waits of about 15 minutes with a reservation. The big problem with that is there is a very small area to wait for your table, and chances are the bar will be full which leaves you literally almost nowhere to stand. Once you're able to make it to a table though, the experience improves significantly.At dinner they serve hot, fresh butter rolls which are so addicting, and at brunch they serve cinnamon buns which are even more addicting... they have a variety of great appetizers too. Check out their happy hour M-F 4-6 to get apps for $3, $5, or $7 including pretzel sticks and awesome wings! As for entrees, my personal favorite is the Ponzu glazed salmon, but they have a large variety of choices from sandwiches to their famous meatloaf to a spicy rigatoni pasta dish. They really have something for everyone!And for dessert I have to recommend the carrot cake. It is a HUGE serving, so be prepared to share, but it is so rich and decadent you'll forget that it actually contains fruit and veggies! Also the chocolate mug cake is very good, and the apple pie. In reality, you can't go wrong with their desserts.Overall, aside from a few logistical challenges, Cap City really knows what they're doing when it comes to running a restaurant. I will keep coming back for years to come!",Gina M.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2004/7/17,"Neat place.  I had a Philly Cheese steak sandwich,  real steak!  My parents love the meatloaf.  Went at about 530pm on a week night,  diverse crowd.",Scott B.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2009/11/16,"I go here at least twice a week.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,11/17/14,"We've been to Cap City a few times since my first review, and I feel like I definitely need to update it!First of all, I have had food at Cap City that is simply outstanding. Fish and chips? Best I've ever had. Something as simple as a lunch soup, salad, and sandwich combo? Delicious! The food is consistently amazing, no matter what I get.The service is sometimes really amazing. Once, we had a really friendly server, but she got sidetracked with talking to another customer. We were in somewhat of a rush, so it was a little frustrating to be waiting so long. Still, that was only once. Every other time, the service has been amazing!We went yesterday for lunch, and our server was really great. He was funny, gregarious, and generous - when I asked for a box for my little half sandwich, my tiny sandwich was boxed up along with about 6 things of crackers and a little cup of soup! He really went above and beyond at the end of the meal.Overall, Cap City is a place that I really enjoy going to. I took an out-of-town guest and she really loved it too. I would recommend to anyone!",Candace M.,,,,,,

I ordered the Romano Crusted Chicken and I loved it! I was surprised by how much I liked it -The sauce was amazing! My co-worker got the balsamic roasted chicken and she also liked hers!

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,10/22/15,"This Cameron Mitchell restaurant was a nice changeup from their typical fine-dining establishments. It was a fun little throw back diner with great service and great food!!We got two appetizers as we couldnt decide on just one, the crab cake and the peel and eat shrimp. Both were delicious and cooked perfectly. Nothing crazy but considering they are going for a ""diner"" atmosphere, its better than you would expect!I got the tamarind chicken wings and fries as my meal and they were wonderful. A great sauce flavor that ive never seem anywhere else was smokey and had a good amount of kick, they were delicious with the blue cheese dressing.  My dad got the blue plate special for the night, which was liver and onions, a dish he is very fond of. I had never tried it but after it got his approval, i gave it a whirl and was not disappointed!! Will definitely be going back to Cap City.",Douglas G.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,2,4/19/17,"I would first like to start by saying that the food was excellent and our waiter was great. It is management that needs some work and that main reason why I am giving 2 stars. We had a party of 6 (including a small child and baby in a carrier) for Easter dinner. We were told we would have to sit in a booth because the larger tables for parties of 7 and 8. Before we even got our appetizer the two tables next us were seated with parties of 6 and 5. We weren't even given the option to wait for one of those tables.My Mom filed a complaint on the restaurant website about this. To which she received a phone call from the manager. He apologized without any empathy. And then proceeded to basically scold her because our reservation did not state that we had small children with us. And that those tables were for 7 and 8 people and it wasn't his fault that the entire party didn't show up. But both tables were specifically set with only 6 chairs and 6 place settings.All that was needed was a meaningful apology instead of being reprimanded. He clearly needs to work on his empathy and customer service skills.",Emily A.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2009/8/14,"I ate here this past weekend while in town for a concert and was very pleased. We got seated right away, even when it was 6pm on a Friday evening. They had happy hour until 630pm, so many people were at the bar. As the name says, it is very much a diner inside, but a little more modern and definitely a lot more space. They gave complimentary dinner rolls that were brushed with butter on the outside, which were pretty good. For my dinner, I got the crabcake sandwich, which was on an English muffin and the waitress allowed me to subsitute in garlic and chive mashed potatoes as my side. The crabcake was definitely made fresh because of the way it fell apart when I bit into it and the crabmeat was soo good. The mashed potatoes also were very fresh and had a nice, potatoey texture and a tasty, but light flavor. My boyfriend got the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, which I had a bite of, and it was very very good.. especially that horseradish sauce that it came with.. sooo so good. Despite how stuffed we were, we had eyeballed the Big Ol' Cup of Chocolate,  which was chocolate lava cake baked inside a mug and topped with vanilla bean ice cream, whipped cream, and a pirouette. This was absolutely delicious and was not in the slightest too sweet or rich,  which was what I was a bit afraid of.I feel like this place would be one of those where you could order anything and it would be pretty good and I'll definitely come back again whenever the opportunity arises.",Jessie T.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,1/29/17,"We had a mixed experience.The waiter was outstanding. He was knowledgeable, great advice on selections and attentive.The food was superb. Good portions presented well and timely.Weak points:1. Reservations were for 6:15 and seated at 6:35. Saturday is always busy, but a reservation should be closer to the time or at least a comp (water) for the added wait.2. I slipped on a lemon and fell to the floor. Not seriously hurt, probably more about the pride. It was crowded, I wasn't looking down to avoid the citrus obstacle. The manager didn't come to the table for 15 minutes and then gave a half hearted apology. Not even asking if I was OK, just ""we are sorry you fell"".3. The water glass was cracked. However, the waiter noticed it and replaced it right away.In the end, we had our appetizers comped. Albeit, they removed it from my check and put it on our guests check which had to be changed.All and all, we would go back if someone suggests without bringing up the experience.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,1,2007/2/17,"My husband, our son and I went there for brunch this early afternoon. We ordered the pecan crusted pork chops, chicken tenders kids meal, and French toast. Absolutely delicious. However our experience was not up to our standards, considering we are both servers for the Bravo Brio Restaurant Group. Our server Kayla, greeted my husband at the host stand and immediately made unnecessary conversation with him, then she conveniently seated us in her section, much to my frustration. She noticed I was frustrated, then added to it by serving me the dirtiest coffee cup she could find. Upon taking our order, she continued to make unnecessary conversation with my husband.... made recommendations only to him, asked only him how his food was, etc. As an experienced server, it was extremely disrespectful and unprofessional. She also forgot his salad even though she only had two tables, us being one of them. I feel like Cameron Mitchell has much higher standards for their staff and I was thoroughly disappointed by the experience, the only saving grace was that the food was good. We won't be returning simply because we were not impressed by the service and I definitely wouldn't recommend Kayla because she is forgetful and careless.",Ashlei M.,,,,,,

The carrot cake was all I wanted it to be. But, Mom's cherry pie was mediocre and skimpy for 7 bucks. The ""award-winning, signature-dish-meatloaf"" was a complete fail. Both of us ordered it. We were hungry and didn't complain.  Served on an unnecessary slice of bread that soaked up the scant, tasty BBQ ""gravy,"" the meatloaf itself was surprisingly bland with no real ""meat taste"" and no sign of onions or peppers.  The texture was soft, and there was no caramelization on top.  I wanted to ask for ketchup but didn't. Making the dish worse, the ""buttermilk chive"" mashed potatoes on top of the meatloaf tasted like mashed potatoes you would get at a cafeteria. I've had better at the hot bar at Giant Eagle.  All in all it was a very ""soft"" dish - no textural contrasts - perfect if you have no teeth. Or tastebuds.",Chris P.,,,,,,

Way too much mayo, to the point that it shot out all over her sweater, and made much of the sandwich inedible.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,2006/7/15,"I have to give the bartenders a hand for doing double-duty on Sundays. If you sit at the bar they're essentially being your wait staff and taking care of all the drinks for the restaurant. They're really busy. So don't sit there if you want great service.Took my parents here one Sunday (their first visit) and it was so busy and packed we decided to eat at the bar. I've been here several times and this is the first time I've experienced subpar service: (1) we were given hard, overbaked room temperature rolls for starters, (2) only checked on twice during meal for refills, etc. and (3) had to wait a bit to close out the check. While there were two bartenders and both were always there it seemed they were just stretched too thin. If a third person was there I imagine they would be stepping on and over each other.If you're going to be served a quick bite and drinking then the bar is the place to sit.The meatloaf is one of their famous items. It's a standard done well. It's meaty and juicy. The balsamic roasted chicken is an upscale version of your basic roasted chicken. Very yummy.The spicy chicken rigatoni has a spicy cream sauce with just the right amount of heat. It's not so strong it overpowers everything else.If you're a chocolate fan than the chocolate cake is a good dessert choice. It's large enough for one person to eat on for days or to share amongst everyone at the table.",Amber S.,,,,,,

I chose Cap City as my family birthday dinner location, and I'm so glad I did. We were seated on the patio, which was quite empty as it was a bit hot outside still. No matter, it was a nice patio! The inside looked really neat and I love that retro diner style, so I will probably sit inside next time. Our server was friendly and helpful without being overbearing. They have a solid menu here! It's large enough that you get a nice diversity of flavors and prices, but not so large that you become overwhelmed. I chose the steak noodle salad, which was more of a noodle dish with some greenery instead of a salad. This was fine by me, as it was actually quite filling. The portions here are substantial- 4/6 people took something home with them. To be fair, part of this is because we were saving room for dessert, but I'll get to that in a sec. My mom and sister both had the salmon with rice and veggies dish, and it was SO GOOD. I tried a bite and it had this tangy sauce drizzled on it that almost made me hijack my mom's plate. My blackberry bramble drink was strong and just the right amount of sweet. I was told by my parents to save room for their creme brulee, and I was so glad I did! It's a nice dessert choice because it's delicious, but not so massive that you feel miserable after eating it. I hope to come back to check out more of their tasty-looking menu, and I feel confident that I'll probably add another star with repeat visits.",Jillian M.,,,,,,

The burger was cooked to medium rare perfection, and the toasted sesame bun was buttery and warm. French fries were delicious, too. One of the most enjoyable surprises were the complementary cinnamon buns. They were warm, fluffy and had just the right amount of sweetness to them.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,1,8/23/15,"Cameron Mitchell has some chutzpah to call this a ""fine"" diner. Seriously. I visited from NYC on Friday, and my parents were excited to take me to this restaurant. With CM's name on it, they assumed it would be fantastic. I did, too, having enjoyed his restaurant in the Renaissance downtown in 2007. Either the mighty have fallen or are happy to slap their name on any old slop. My dad and I both agreed that the Southern fried chicken sounded great, so we ordered that. I was expecting something that matched the description. What I got was two dry pieces of paillard-style chicken - cheap cuts pounded very thinly and coated in something soggy and slightly sweet. This disappointment was accompanied by mac and cheese (which wasn't macaroni at all, but cavatappi), which I wasn't told was garlic mac and cheese. Avoid it if you're not a fan of inhaling entire bulbs of garlic. The mashed potatoes were some disturbing substance that seemed to come from a powder. It had none of the flavor or texture of actual mashed potatoes. A pale gravy with skin already formed on top was supposed to entice, I guess. It failed.Thing is, living in New York, I've frequented a fair number of diners and a fair number of fine dining establishments. Cap City Diner doesn't even rate in comparison with the greasy spoons in the average NYC neighborhood. It takes a breathtaking amount of arrogance to call this a ""fine"" diner. Either somebody doesn't care about quality or is truly deluded as to how awful this is. One thing's for sure: The manager couldn't be bothered to take care of customers. He hung out with a couple of regulars the whole time, never checking on tables to see if people enjoyed their food or otherwise attending to the restaurant. Seems like he had his hands full hanging out and shooting the breeze.I feel sorry for the waitstaff here, because inevitably they are the ones who have to deal with the disappointment of customers. They didn't cook the food or make the ""fine"" diner promises, but they bear the brunt of the consequences as the restaurant fails on every count. In case it's not obvious, I won't be returning, and I've already warned my friends in Columbus to avoid this place at all costs.",Jackie D.,,,,,,

Parking was very hard to find and a wait for 4 was 20 minutes, luckily we found 4 ""counter seats"" overlooking the kitchen, which were available for immediate occupation. I was between the Ruben and the fish sandwich, the waitress told me the Ruben is popular but she personally adores the fish sandwich. So I went with the fish sandwich and fries. Our meals were out in what felt like 5 minutes or less! My fish sandwich was amazing, huge, crispy, so amazing. The best fish sandwich I've had since moving to Ohio!One friend got the philly cheese steak, I tried it and it was a great flavor! Also a great choice. Another friend got the fish and chips, smaller pieces of fish than my sandwich but also crispy and wonderful. The fourth of us got a cup of soup and a key lime pie, which was a very large portion of pie. There was a lot of crust to it, but it was good none the less! It was its own individual very tall pie. We did have to hunt the waitress down for water refills, which a few other people on Yelp mentioned. The waitress did take care of our checks in lightning fast time. And like other reviews on Yelp said, none of the staff standing around the door tells you goodbye when you leave (which is fine by me.) I'll be back for sure, for $11 that fish sandwich was huge and amazing and I can't wait to bring my mother here to try it!!",Jessica P.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,10/28/14,"Brunch/lunch and dinner at Cap City Diner are great. I love their quiche for brunch and their wraps are also very good. Otherwise, other dishes are pretty general American dishes, i.e. meatloaf, salads, steaks. Their cinnamon buns I had during brunch are a nice change from the normal biscuits/buns you normally get at other restaurants. Portions at Cap City are big and I almost always end up taking quite a bit of food back to eat. Because I generally enjoyed my meals at Cap City, I thought I would also enjoy their happy hour. However, I was pretty disappointed. The drinks are pretty standard, nothing too special. Their happy hour menu was very limited and quite expensive. I split an order of the pretzel, calamari, and wings with someone and we both felt that they were only alright, and not particularly worth the price. Also, happy hour is only at the bar so it's difficult to get together with a group there if that's what you want.",Tiffany W.,,,,,,

Cinnamon glaze added to their rolls for Sunday brunch is a great touch- CM really hit the nail on the head with this one . 'Upscale diner', prices are on point, food is consistent.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2006/7/14,"Of all the Cameron Mitchell restaurants in town, I believe Cap City is my wife's favorite. (I would say that mine is the Ocean Club) She really likes their relatively down-to-earth menu, where you don't have to have any culinary knowledge to figure out what's in your dish. It's nothing fancy (meat loaf, fried chicken, pork chop, etc.) but they do it very, very well. Their bread basket is delicious, and we love their carrot cake... if you have any room for dessert. Compared to the other Cameron Mitchell restaurants, the price here is also comparatively reasonable, so that's another plus.Another thing that I love about this restaurant is their wait staff. They are so attentive, polite, and just delightful to interact with on a consistent basis. Our waiter during our visit tonight actually remembered us and exactly where we sat from our previous visit almost 3 months ago.My residency program used this restaurant for pre-interview dinners, so we used to go here 6-8 times per year for 3 years. Never once did we have a dish that was bad, nor have we had a bad experience with the staff. One point of caution though, is that on busy nights, the wait time can be ridiculous.

I've heard from a couple people that cap city had a pretty decent fish and chips but decent was kind of an exaggeration. Our service was great and the waitress was super attentive and friendly. Our shrimp appetizer was muy bien but the fish and chips was a flop. The fries were hot, but soggy and far from ""chips"". The fish were more like the spherical chunks we ate in grade school.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,2,3/16/15,"My boyfriend and I were in town on a day trip and we wanted to stop somewhere to get food. Nowhere on their website does Cap City state it is upscale or that you should dress more formal than usual, so we thought we'd be fine with jeans and leggings. Once we entered, we were greeted with rude glares and poor service. We were seated in a corner out of sight of everyone else. The food was great, I will give them that, but extremely over priced. We ordered the crab cake appetizer for $12. We expected at least 2-3 cakes, but we received 1. It's never acceptable to charge $12 for one crab cake. The business needs to figure out what they want to be. Do you want to be an upscale fine dining restaurant or a diner? There's no inbetween. You can't have elegant lighting and expensive food but claim to be a diner. When we left, not a single person said a word. The four waiters & waitresses that were  standing by the door continued laughing loudly as we walked out the door, no goodbyes or anything. Overall very disappointing trip.

I generally I am not a fan of American fare food, but Cap City surprised me. I went with two others and we all got three sandwiches and each tried them all. We tried the Philly Steak, Fried Fish sandwich, and reuben. I got the wild rice side and my friends got the fries. First, the food was quick it there was no wait with our food. All of the sandwiches were incredible. My favorite had to be the philly steak however. It was served on the proper bun and was packed with flavor. My wild rice salad was light and very enjoyable. The fries were seasoned and salted to perfection. Lastly we had to finish with dessert. We all split the chocolate cake and still only ate one third of it. It was very good and huge.

They had things like burgers and meatloaf, but went further to offer pastas and great entrees. Their salad selection was big.

What arrived was essentially breaded chicken tenders.  Big disappointment.  I had meatloaf, which was good (and a lot) and our two friends had the crab crusted tilapia, which they enjoyed.  The caesar salad dressing is phenomenal.  The desserts, which others raved about in other reviews were ""meh.""  Our friends shared the cherry pie special and said it was ok.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,6/17/13,"The five stars are for the superb service my mom and I received when we popped in about half an hour before closing. Although I feel a little guilty coming into a restaurant that late, knowing that some of the staff will be working later than they might like as a result, no one at Cap City expressed any frustration or weariness about it.Our server, Jeff, was a doll. He came over and was in the middle of telling us the specials. Soon as he started talking about the meat, meat, meat, my mom broke in, pointed at me, and said, ""Vegan."" Now... there are more animal products I avoid than those I eat, but I never claim to be a vegan. My mother knows this. I think she was trying to make the moment funny by stopping the server in his tracks. Unfortunately, it wasn't very funny, and it made it too awkward for me to order the very non-vegan shrimp I had my eye on.But what it did do was give Jeff the chance to show how considerate and helpful he and the diner as a whole could be when faced with a customer with dietary restrictions. The menu has a few things on it suitable for ovo-lacto vegetarians but literally nothing ready-made for vegans (y'know, aside from beverages). Anything one might want would need to be modified in some way. As we discovered, they're more than happy to modify. Jeff checked on the contents of the black bean burger for me and reported back apologetically that it has egg in it. Not easily modifiable. But (he noted)! ...the dish uninspiringly called ""Seasonal Vegetable Plate"" gets its dousing of dairy after the food is prepared, and so it might be a good option.My mom and I decided to split this dish. What's more, Jeff asked the kitchen -- and the kitchen complied -- to make one half vegan and one half not. So mom's was slathered in butter and goat cheese and mine wasn't. And let me tell you about this dish. Ok, so if you saw ""Seasonal Vegetable Plate"" on a menu, would it grab your attention and shout to you, ""Order me!"" in a plaintive plea? No, me neither. Despite being the one item on the menu that sounds critter product-free, the name would fill my brain with visions of bland steamed carrots and broccoli, and I would pass right by it. But that's not what this is.It has veggies, yes, but it also has some really tasty hummus and plenty of pita bread. It has a fluffy wild rice side with bits of everything in it, including some flavorful cherries that complement the wild rice perfectly. The veggies are anything but bland and certainly not steamed but roasted and juicy. And if you're not me dining out with my overzealous mother, you get goat cheese, too. This ""vegetable"" plate, which is more like a vegetarian feast, is a secret in plain view on the menu. (As a side note, the lack of butter did not deter from the dish one bit, as far as I could tell.)And the strawberry-basil lemonade was pretty kickass, too.So:* Polite service despite our late arrival.* Server bent over backward to help customer find something she'd be happy with.* House happy to not only split a dish but prepare it differently for each half. (My mom picked up the check, so I don't know if they charged a split dish fee.)* No one rushed us out when we finished past closing time; in fact, our server offered us dessert.If this isn't five-star service, I don't know what is.",Lea P.,,,,,,

Honestly, it kicked butt, but the others are just kickin' butt harder!Last, to my surprise was the pork chop. All recommended it. Personally, the candied walnuts were WAY too sweet for me, and the meat was a bit dry. I suspect it is normally great, I just got one a bit over done.The tomato soup is superb.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,6/13/13,"Pro Tip: However hungry you think you are, subtract one dish (including an entree) for every two people and you'll likely still emerge from Cap City a few inches thicker. While the vegetable plate came with warm, grilled veggies, melted goat cheese and fat, scrumptious pita, the hummus was a tad salty...especially when paired with smushy, warm olives. But the rice pilaf is something to bring back to your local diner and suggest to Flo...it's not greasy and is delicately topped with crunchy almond slivers. The pilaf itself is cooked al dente (if it's possible to describe rice that way) and loaded with dried cranberries and raisins, which add a nice sweet kick to compliment the nutty rice. But the real star of Cap City is its bavarian pretzel appetizer. The pretzels are slightly doughy, with a nice, dark amber crust sprinkled with just enough kosher salt. For dipping, these pretzels (two per order) are served with the most amazing beer cheese  - melted, with a hoppy, earthy flavor - and homemade mustard, which retails a bit of the crunch from mustard seeds. The salads are alright.",Ettya F.,,,,,,

We got the chips and bleu cheese for an appetizer.  Man am i glad i got that!   I Would have licked the plate had my wife and child not been there.  I got the reuben as my lunch/dinner along with a side of fries.  I was dipping my fries in the bleu cheese dressing from the appetizer... OUTSTANDING!!  I really liked everything.  It was simple, clean, and very family friendly!!",Jerod B.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2007/5/15,"We had the southern fried chicken dinner it was good, but not great. The chicken was moist and the mashed potatoes were good, however the skillet beans were not good. They were steamed green beans that were lacking any flavor, and definitely not southern style. I would order the chicken again but try another side. The reason I gave the restaurant 4 stars was the service which was excellent! The server was very attentive and was so polite. This is something so simple that is not found in many restaurants anymore. It made the whole dinning much more enjoyable.We will be going back again soon.",Diane F.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,9/13/14,"This was actually my second visit to Cap City and I wasn't really excited prior to arriving or looking at the menu, but I was pleasantly surprised by the experience and by the end of our stay it had me thinking why we hadn't been back here sooner. The one standout from our otherwise forgettable first visit was the Prince Edward Island mussels in a white wine sauce. Absolutely delicious both times and any time we come back in the future they will always be the go to appetizer. The mussels are served in a large bowl and while the portion is definitely generous, mussels are only so filling, but on this occasion, the fact that they weren't terribly filling was perfect. For my entree, I had the eggs on hash which ended up being two eggs fried over medium (but they can be cooked however you like them) over breakfast potatoes and short rib tips coated in vermont white cheddar - the short ribs weren't really hash by the true definition - but, I liked it more than if it would have been true hash. I am an ever increasingly huge fan of breakfast, and I could definitely foresee this being a craving. My girlfriend had the fish and chips which she liked. I am not a huge fan of cooked fish outside of salmon and trout so I didn't try it, but as a non-fish eater, it looked pretty appetizing and I regret not trying any now that I am thinking about it. The presentation on the plate was very visually appealing  (for my dish as well) and if you are a fan of fish and chips, it seems like you'd be satisfied both in taste and portion. Not to be forgotten, but not worthy of higher billing are the cinnamon rolls, a nice homage to what I would consider ""classic"" diner dining, and very reminiscent of my childhood in New Jersey where diners are everywhere. If you are expecting bakery cinnamon rolls or even pillsbury cinnamon rolls hopefully this saves you some disappointment. BUT, the rolls (and when I say rolls I mean dinner rolls) come out nice and hot and the cinnamon topping/glaze and cream cheese icing are more than sufficient to call the finished product a cinnamon roll, even if it doesn't exactly comport with tradition. I have yet to see the dessert menu, but I am anticipating it being good and will probably get something when I come back. The service was good. The waitress was friendly and prompt and the only delay was in bringing the check and this wasn't for lack of attention but simply because she was conversing with other patrons. Overall, this place is definitely solid and we will more than likely be back, and almost definitely so if we're hungry and in the area. I say four stars not five because my first experience was pretty lackluster with the standout disappointment being the blackberry sage lemonade and because I haven't had dessert or a drink (alcoholic) yet. Regardless of this review accounting for past sins, I would definitely recommend this place, especially if you are a fan of diner food or american food with a fine dining twist.",Curt P.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2/13/16,"We came here for dessert one evening a couple of weeks ago, and wow - am I happy we did! We sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen, and I could see all of the restaurant staff working hard and making some amazing food. Our server was very friendly and efficient. The ""24K Carrot Cake"" was out of this world. The frosting was perfect. My friends also tried the ""Warm Banana Bread Pudding"" and the ""Big Cup O'Chocolate,"" and they raved about both.

They have a very friendly staff who are usually more than happy to accommodate their guests (within reason). I have never; and I mean Never, had a sub-par dish here. Between my friends, family and myself, we have probably tried everything on the menu. The apps are good, the entrees are fantastic and their deserts are to die for! Although we have quite a few options in Grandview area; I would have to say that Cap City Diner is my favorite Brunch spot.BIG kudos to Brian who is our regular bartender.

My favorite part of the meal tho was their chips. Now I could eat those allllll day. But as for the rest of the menu, I think I'll pass.",Zach T.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,7/15/16,"I've lived in Columbus for a little over a year and had never visited Cap City until last night, for my birthday dinner!   The staff was all very friendly - something that's not always given these days.  Our waitress was awesome, and we were a group that asked a lot of questions.  I wish I had taken the time to read the Yelp reviews before I visited, but I will definitely be back to try some of the recommended entrees.  We knew we were having dessert so we opted for salad entrees.  the BBQ Chopped Salad was good, but not great.  I like my protein served warm on salads, and it was cold here.  Didn't think to ask, and I'm sure they would have served it warm for me, had I.  Greek salad was also delicious - love the balsamic dressing they use.   Dessert was glorious - carrot cake with white chocolate cream cheese frosting and the Tennessee Mud Pie tasted like a Dairy Queen birthday cake, with coffee, and much better quality.  I'll definitely be back - it's a cute spot for a date night, group of friends, or somewhere to take visiting family, if they like homestyle cooking with a twist.  *Was a bit surprised that some items were not on the menu - no form of mac and cheese for example.",Ren P.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,2,9/19/15,"A lot of my friends raved about this place, which is why we decided to check it out.  I'm sorry to say, but I was rather disappointed by the food.  It tasted, for the most part, ok, but given the price label on them, it just wasn't worth paying that much money for.  The environment is nice and family-oriented, but I would probably not go back.  I don't mind paying high prices for food, but they really have to be worth the price, and this just wasn't up to par.",Alice J.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,3/24/13,"Columbus is fortunate to have the Cameron Mitchell restaurants.   They are locally owned restaurants that offer great dining experiences.   I had not been to Cap City in quite a while and had a couple gift cards from the holidays that were burning a hole in my pocket.    I have never had a bad experience with the restaurant.  Cap City focuses its menu on what I would call ""comfort food"".   Menu items are very reasonably priced.   Usually, when I go out to eat, I am looking for something that I likely would not  have at home, but I enjoy their meatloaf.   It is a nice portion of meatleaf, served on a thick slice of Texas toasted bread, covered with mashed potatoes, straw onions and gravy with a small side of steamed broccoli.   It was just as tasty as all the times before.  The menu has a daily blue plate special.   My dining partner tried out the cola braised short ribs which were very juicy & tender.    For all you chocolate lovers, I have to give a ""shout-out"" for the ""seriously big chocolate cake"".   I always get one ""to go"" because I love putting it in the refrigerator and having it the next day - total chocoholic paradise!Service was good, but maybe spread a little too thin.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,7/29/16,"Is it weird that my only complaint of this awesome restaurant is the food quantity? My friend and I split the blue cheese chips soooo tasty, as well as the pecan pork chops and holy cow amazing and we we didn't eat nearly half of our appetizer or all of our entree. Seriously the portions are insane. Alright back to the food. The chips were great and crisp. The Alfredo sauce was velvety and lovely, making me wish that I ordered a pasta dish. The blue cheese crumbles or should I say chunks were  a great addition. When I said we split (my friend doesn't care for blue cheese so her's was topped with cheddar) this appetizer they gave us two salad bowls filled with chips. We could have split this appetizer with two or more friends, it's that big. We also ordered their vodka strawberry lemonade and it is dangerously good. Sweet and flavorful but with enough alcohol you can tell you are getting your money's worth. As for the pecan crusted pork chops...... Well it was certainly in top 5 best ever. Once again we split this meal which consisted of two chops, sautÌ©ed spinach and a spicy cheesy mashed potatoes and left enough on both plates for left overs for one of us to take home (sadly we weren't going straight home so it had to be left behind ). I even forgot to mention that every employee that we came across (the host/ess and waitress) were incredibly sweet and personable.

This is the perfect place for a date night or to take out of town guest.My favorite is the meatloaf but the Romano crusted chicken is excellent.  I have taken out of town clients and family that were here for a visit.  I have yet to get a complaint of anyone.  The drinks are good, the wine list is adequate as well as the beer menu.  It can get busy on the weekend so I would recommend making a reservation (I used open table).  The one thing that is a drawback is the parking situation.  I shares a lot with a medical office and there have been times that I had to circle the lot to find a spot.  There is talk that the restaurant and surrounding businesses are being redeveloped.

Just good quality comfort food like meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Get the chips topped with the Alfredo-blue cheese nonsense, you won't be sorry. Service is friendly enough, drinks are good. The patio is nice, otherwise the seating/dining room  is pretty boring but it's a essentially an upscale diner so it is what it is.This is a super solid pick for lunch or dinner.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,8/27/14,"It's a good place, food is good, service is nice, and it's elegant yet casual.One thing that rubbed me the wrong way right off the bat is that their ""happy hour"" pricing is only good if you sit at the bar. This is the only restaurant that I recall did not honor their happy hour prices in the entire restaurant. It would have saved us $5 on our two beers, but alas, no discount was to be had. (to add to this, the sandwich board in front that toted their happy hour had no mention of bar only).The jalapeno slaw I had did not have any jalapeno flavor at all, it was still good though. The shrimp banh mi wrap I had was good, although the wrap was too big to dip into the ponzu sauce so I ended up deconstructing and reconstructing the wrap to sauce it.They could also stand a refresh of their beer selection, with our craft renaissance currently happening in Columbus, a large local selection is a must for a restaurant of this supposed caliber. Rather than some odd import selections (EG Palm?)Bill for two (one drink and one dinner each) was $50.50 after standard tip, not winning any hearts on the price scale here either.

Fish and Chips 15 bucks?  No thank you.I work in the area so we've had people order it for us...everytime I've gotten something to go the bread is soggy and gross (when I called they suggested ordering the bread on the side...how's that my responsibility?)  I ordered the fish and chips once to go and it was literally dripping with grease.  The batter wasn't crispy but soggy and fell right off.  I ordered an expensive martini there once and it came to the table half full as if the waitress spilled it on the way.Even when I've had something not bad there it was just that...not bad.  The other restaurants in his group are much better.",Michael U.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,1/29/11,"I've been to Cap City maybe 4 or 5 times in my 5.5 years of living in Columbus.  The first time I ate there I had the triple decker grilled cheese and loved it.  The way it's made (with fried egg, tomato, and a light sauce) was unlike any other grilled cheese I've had... it was the ""finer"" aspect of the fine diner.  Tonight, we sat at the bar and we shared the grilled cheese and tomato soup; it was perfect.  The bar became packed as the night went on so our server/bartender wasn't as ""attentive,"" but when the side was incorrect he immediately went and got the correct one and when we didn't have the piece of cake we ordered after 10 minutes he immediately went to get that as well... we just had to ask/remind him.  The meal was served on separate plates for my friend and I, so they had already split the meal for us rather than bringing out an ""extra"" plate for us to split ourselves.We were very lucky as they were still celebrating chocolate cake day, so we also split a piece of chocolate cake, which was richly decadent AND HUGE! We ate maybe  of the cake and my friend had to take the rest home.I agree with other reviewers, the drink prices were a little high. I had 2 drinks and they were $12 of the bill... usually they would be  1/2 that price at other restaurants.My bill was about $30 and everything we ordered was split between 2 people (soup, sandwich, and cake), with the exception of my 2 drinks.

So let's get rid of the 5-star simply by stating parking is not appealing.  I had to shove my Chevy behind the Just Energy building next to the railroad tracks at 6:45PM... so the place is busy but you'll be taxed to lock & load.Upon entering the greeter was gracious; they had my reservation (Open Table - yes indeed).  I took a seat in the nearby bar to wait for friends running 10 minutes late.  This little nook was not comfortable with its naugahyde bar stools but it sufficed as the diner's staging area.  My Crown on the Rocks - splendidly full.  A whopper of a pour for under $10 - nice....!Our party was seated inside (temps outside were steamy; good choice) and we received a booth.  It was cramped as the bench seats angle towards the back so you're pinched.  Naugahyde... again.  Sticky wickets.But then came the service and the food.  Waiter Craig was the man with the plan. His verbal repetoire was impecable - the specials flew through the air even while he was taking drink orders.  In the end the selections were; Ponzu Glazed Salmon with stir fry veggies (yes - mine; and delicious and hot); Crab Crusted Tilapia with roasted veggies (my friend never looked up and smiled upon completion); Jake's Famous Reuben with Maytag Blue Cheese salad (his favorite).  All three of us were completed satisfied with the food prep, presentations and taste.  And all this for under $100 including tip.

Today, I'm having a perfectly prepared Ponzu-Glazed Salmon, with pineapple sticky rice and lovely stir-fried veggies that perfectly accompany the dish. On both occasions, I sat at the bar, due to time constraints. The bartender, Joe, was awesome! So nice, so personable, yet without feeling cloying or hovering. More importantly, he got me out the door with an almost-fast-food-like efficiency, without ever making me feel rushed.  He anticipated every need, didn't bother me -- it was like being back in NYC with a truly professional wait staff. Great work, C M!",Amanda G.,,,,,,

AND THAT STRAWBERRY LEMONADE...HOLY. I've gotten multiple people addicted to this sweet, tart, and refreshing drink. Even the bread basket makes me happy, especially at brunch.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,8/18/14,"I absolutely loved it here! We were in town moving my boyfriend into school so we were staying at the Marriott right down the street and decided to walk to the restaurant which was about a block away. For drinks I got a cucumber chiller which had rye in it and it was very different and refreshing. My boyfriend got some sort of grapefruit Alcoholic drink and his was good too just very sweet! For an appetizer we got pretzel & beer cheese. The pretzel was amazing. I've been to Germany and it tastes a lot like their pretzels. Paired with the beer cheese was so good! It also came with honey mustard which was pretty good but I'm a honey mustard enthusiast so I've had way better! For dinner my boyfriends dish was by far the best one we ordered. He ordered the spicy chicken rigatoni. It came with mushrooms, peppers, onions, spinach, and tomatos in a red pepper sauce which was to die for. I ordered their famous meatloaf and I liked that as well. The presentation was great it had Texas toast on the bottom then meatloaf, mashed potatoes and topped with fried onion flakes. It also had 2 pieces of broccoli with a sweet sauce around the plate. It was good and I would order it again, but last night the pasta was just the winner! I really love coming to Columbus and trying out all of the food places they have to offer! Next time I come back I will definitely be getting the spicy pasta!!",Bre H.,,,,,,

I assume this is the most casual of the bunch, but the service was still very good and food was great! Mom had the meatloaf, which she loved but said it wasn't as good her her moms, Dad had fish and chips and I tried a veggie shrimp wrap sans the shrimp. I would love to see a better selection for vegetarians, but the wrap was good. My favorite part was dessert! The peanut butter pie, chosen by my father, sounded bland and unappealing but I was so wrong! Creamy and rich, this pie really finished off the meal. It had a chocolate (maybe oreo) crust with a mousse like filing. I'd really love to come back and try some more items off the menu, especially in the summer to check out the patio!",Sarah F.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2008/7/11,"I've been coming to Cap City Diner since I first moved to Columbus five years ago (has it really been that long?). What I love about CCD is the consistency/taste of the food, the five-star service, and the outdoor patio.This is a place full of comfort food-- think butter-covered rolls, meatloaf, heavy pasta dishes. My favorite item on the menu is the gigantic basket of fish and chips, incredibly light and crispy every time with homemade tarter sauce. Their bleu-cheese coleslaw is amazing. Their iceberg wedge salad is so tasty and crisp, covered in insanely delicious bacon and the most magical bleu-cheese dressing I've ever tasted. I also love their ""Black and Bleu"" salad, which is basically the wedge salad with blackened salmon. Are you noticing a trend here? Their meatloaf is also spectacular and their desserts are ginormous and rich. I love the carrot cake and the chocolate cake (big enough to share with 3-4 people).The outdoor patio at CCD is so fantastic for summer lunches and cool evenings. They have a great list of cocktails at somewhat reasonable prices. Their white sangria is one of my favorites. The service is perfect-- the waiters are respectful, friendly, knowledgeable about the food, and always on their game (and refills)-- pretty awesome for a so-called ""diner.""My small complaints for the menu echo other reviewers. Firstly, the menu has remained relatively stagnant for the past few years. I think it would be great if CCD could add some more seasonal foods to spice things up. Secondly, most things on the menu are extremely heavy-- lots of red meat, fried foods, heavy pasta dishes, salads doused in (albeit delicious) creamy dressings, monstrously-sized pieces of cake. I'd love to see some lighter, more healthful items on the menu. If anyone can make healthy food taste amazing, it's Cameron Mitchell.",Sarah R.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,2002/10/14,"The 3 star rating is composed of 2 stars for the Southern Fried Chicken and 4 stars for everything else.Cap City's ""Southern Fried Chicken"" is not any kind of southern fried chicken I have ever had, and I have had plenty of truly excellent southern fried chicken.  Cap City should call it ""Honey Fried Chicken Tenders"" because that is exactly what it is.  If you like that sort of thing, Cap City has perfectly cooked, boneless fried chicken breasts drizzled with honey that will make you happy.  It did not make me happy.I have had homemade and restaurant southern fried chicken in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and California.  Southern fried chicken is savory, juicy and bursting with flavor.  You want to eat every bit of breading and chicken possible.  It makes you happy, it is decadent, and dark meat plays a key role.Cap City, for $16.99, will give you two pieces of boneless chicken breast, breaded and deep-fried, along with skillet green beans, buttermilk mashed potatoes and pan gravy.  The only flavor profile is slightly sweet - not savory at all.  The taste profile is clean and light, where southern fried chicken should be filthy with flavor.  The beans are fine, and the mashed potatoes perfectly adequate.  The gravy was a dollop restricted to the potatoes, not nearly enough to appropriately complement the chicken.Everything else lived up to Cameron Mitchell standards. The service was excellent, the restaurant warm, spotless and inviting, the salad, bread, beer and my wife's Reuben simply great.  Do not avoid Cap City, it is a great restaurant.  DO avoid the ""Southern Fried Chicken"" if you are in the mood for southern fried chicken.",Rob D.,,,,,,

The blue cheese coleslaw was also quite good.The ONLY disappoint was that the fries tasted out of a frozen packet... just wasn't as up  to par as the rest of the food. It wasn't so bad that it would effect the rating ... just worth noting. But, hey, they're fries -- they can't be bad... right?As for drinks, two of us got the beer flights... which was wonderful.

The portion size was large. I tried the crab crusted tilapia which was cooked perfectly. It came with a veg mix and red skin potatoes.

During our last visit, we had multiple people at our table ask for ketchup several times before it was actually brought, and refills of water never came.

While I felt the brunch/lunch selection was good, overall I still find this place to be overpriced for the quality of the food. Maybe it's just the Jersey-girl in me that's used to a real diner experience, but I was disappointed in my food. I ordered the Lox & Bagel and was actually surprised to see that it came out disassembled. I guess this is for ""presentation"" but if I wanted to build my own lox & bagels I could've gone out and gotten the ingredients myself and had a few meals worth for the price instead of just one.  The actual lox part of the meal was really lacking. I basically had two thin pathetic pieces and a mound of cream cheese that was enough for two full bagels.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,9/27/13,"came here last night with my mentee and had a nice meal. I had the meatloaf that everyone has been raving about and my mentee had the pork chops. The portions were healthy, but the pork chop ones were REALLY big.The meatloaf was very good and the components (toast, mashed potatoes, broccoli, etc.) were all tasty. I would have preferred that it was not all lumped on top of each other in a tower, but I suppose I will have to let that go for the sake of culinary aesthetic appeal. All the flavors played very well with each other and I didn't have to reach for the ketchup!I had a taste of my mentee's pork chops and they were very good! Moist and flavorful, they had a great candied pecan crust that had a nice sweet taste.  The greens and sweet potato mash were also very good.The only down side to this restaurant is the parking and proximity to other tables. The parking situation is pretty difficult so we ended up parking on the back side of the Ohio Health facility, not sure if that's ok, but I didn't get a ticket, so that's good.  Also, the tables seem to be pretty close to each other, or at least I felt like the table next to us kept staring at our food, which was a bit weird.",Moses S.,,,,,,

It was one of those situations where you look at the sandwich, you start to eat it and you're thinking, ""There's no way I'm gonna finish this thing.""  Next thing you know, you're 1/3 of the way in to the second half and you figure, ""Well, so much for that plan"" and down it goes.

I was definitely NOT the only person in a suit and tie, too, which I always appreciate.One negative - there were fruit flies.  We had a table by the front window, and maybe there was a little crack or it hadn't been cleaned in a while or something, but there were fruit flies buzzing around us pretty much the entire time.

I ordered the night's special, crab stuffed shrimp with a side of asparagus and mashed potatoes. It was seasoned incredibly well, and not too heavy. Most of the items on the menu looked like good twists on old diner favorites. There were also more gourmet like options for those feeling fancy. I topped the meal off with the hugest apple pie a la mode ever. What I really liked about this place is the food is a lot more snazzy than the atmosphere. It's easy to get what feels like a fancy meal in what's really a casual dining restaurant. The place, however, is not a diner.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,5/28/11,"As I've said in other reviews I have a love hate relationship with Cameron Mitchell Restaurants. This is one that I love!My wife and I stopped here after catching a Noon movie over at Lennox. Even though lunch was well would down the greeter was prompt and even came out to open the door for us. Our server was training another server and it was clear as to why. He was very professional and very friendly. So friendly I even took the time to fill out one of those stupid comment cards they always bring with your check.To start I had one of their non-alcoholic beverage concoctions, basically a pomegranate/lime sparkling water. It was pricey, but fantastic. For our lunches my wife had soup and salad and I had the much raved about meatloaf. The food came out fast and hot. My wife thoroughly enjoyed both the soup and the salad and I really liked the meatloaf. Naturally the meatloaf wasn't as good as mine, but it was definitely good and it's easy to understand why so many people like it. Despite being pretty stuffed we ordered the three layer chocolate cake we'd heard so much about. If anything ever lived up to the hype it was this cake. My wife loves anything chocolate or anything cake so her raves don't mean too much, but I on the other hand am not even a big chocolate fan and this was the most moist delicious cake I've had in a long time. Most of it ended up getting saved for later though as it is truly enormous.Lunch prices were totally reasonable, if a little high, but not as overpriced as some of the other restaurants in CMR group. To sum up, it's not the greatest place in Columbus, but it's definitely worth a try.",Kevin R.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,6/13/13,"Straightforward: what I wanted was what I got.

I will try my hand at something new next time: I am thinking the Pork Chops because it looked really good from glances. Dessert: Since my girlfriend received a free piece of the triple-layer chocolate cake, I ordered the Big Cup O' Chocolate...and it was awe-inspiring.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,2,2/19/13,"I tried Cap City for brunch, and was not impressed by the menu options for healthy, paleo, or gluten-free diet.Given, I have paleo diet restrictions that can be easily messed up by a ""typical"" meal.  I ordered a salad, specifically noting things I did not want on it because they would make me sick.  When the salad was brought to me, it had all sorts of things on it that I could not eat.  I should have said something, but instead tried to eat around.  I ended feeling really bad after the meal, and it made for an overall inconvenient and expense experience.At most restaurants, I can find straight forward salads that are easily to spin into a healthy option.  At Cap City, the menu is much more complicated, perhaps due to the ""fine dining"" aspect.  Perhaps my diet is not meant for fine dining?  Either way, when I walk away from a $13 bill wishing I had gone to Chipotle or Pita Pit instead, my buyer's remorse tells me this is probably a two star experience.",Joey H.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,5/23/13,"I'm a firm believer in truth in advertising so when someone asks how I am, I tend to spout off the truth. When my server Ryan opened with a friendly ""What brought you in today?"" I gave him the truth: my day sucked. And it did. My partner and I both wanted cheering up so we found the closest restaurant that would meet both our needs. Here's your spoiler: our dinner did cheer me up.My lover is a Midwestern farm boy and loves a traditional Midwestern diner; I'm an urban foodie who likes high concept, high taste food. Cap City rolls on both counts. The look of the place made me squeal a little bit; everything is the right mix of old and new, open and closed, shiny and matte. The formica table tops didn't feel cheap or gimmicky with the rest of the room. I consider that architectural balance something important because the type of space we're in changes how we feel about our time there. This is just a general human fact, and this human likes spaces with balance. The opening note at Cap City is a basket of rolls. Hot damn. They butter the tops just perfectly for a butter fan like me, but I suspect that could be an overboard experience for someone else. Butter fan makes good, though. The light, fluffy dinner rolls disappeared with enough alacrity that I can assume my partner also loved them. Here's where the service takes a turn from ""pretty good"" to ""amazing team."" My partner has an MSG allergy. Asking about MSG in a place like this is an insult, but we subscribe to a ""better safe than sorry"" policy. The kitchen team knew that their house-made sauces and broth didn't have a hint of MSG, but they checked all of the bases just to make sure. Everything came back clean except the perpetual offender (ranch dressing). We were surprised by the depth of their check, and I am impressed by how seriously this restaurant takes food allergies and sensitivities. (They have a full gluten-free menu, too. Wow!)Ordering was easy. Our server described some of the dishes with ease, and the menu was clear and precise enough that we didn't have many questions. It was obvious that the food was well thought out and heavily considered before anything was added to the menu. He got the meatloaf, and I went for the old appetizer/salad dinner with the Maytag blue cheese chips and a blue cheese salad. We also mixed a beer flight in because why not? Trying four regional beers is more fun than one! Here's where the diner part loops back: not only does Cap City look diner-ish, but they do the ""food, fast and good"" part of a diner. In a traditional diner, food should appear pretty darn fast. There should not be a huge wait, and I like that. The food came a lot faster than either of us expected, and we were delighted by the timing.All three dishes were more than enough: dense, tasty, comfort food done really well. High concept comfort food? Not over-thought, not under done. My partner was impressed with the meatloaf, although he didn't love the slice of bread it came on. When meatloaf is more than just ""shove ground beef in a loaf pan and bake"", it generally goes well. This meatloaf is more than just ground beef in a pan. My meal was indulgent to the max. The chips were filling enough that I could have eaten just the chips. Take that in for a second. This fat girl with a side of gluttony could have eaten JUST the chips. Angels are sighing in gratitude for these chips. The blue cheese melted decadently into the alfredo, which didn't make the chips soggy with my steady nibbling. Yum-o. From here on out, the service was present without being intrusive or clingy. We were offered dessert and our bill in a timely manner, and the dessert conversation was a no-pressure experience. Ryan offered it with a smile, and he took our full bellies with a smile. I didn't feel bad for being too full for more. I do rather wish I'd saved room for dessert, but I have incentive to return. Plain and simple! Would I recommend this place? Of course. It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun. The food was great, the service shined, and people seemed happy to be there. It brightened my day immeasurably, too. Accessibility notes: no Braille menu or signage. Can get loud at peak hours. Tables are far apart for mobility devices, but many booths also populate the dining room. High bar.",Suzanne C.,,,,,,

No, there isn't an overdose of Marylin and Elvis, just a decent amount of chrome and checkerboard motif. If I need a decent place not too far from downtown to meet a client for a business-casual lunch, Cap City can play that role.  The Ponzu Salmon absolutely rocks.  I've personally witnessed at least ten friends, colleagues or clients down this dish with nary a complaint.  If you can eat a giant slab of meatloaf for lunch (I can't, without ending up on the floor under my desk with a pillow), Cap City's is top notch.When I'm dipping into my own coffers for lunch, I'll often end up sitting at the bar at Cap City (especially during winter).  The soup/salad combo is fantastic due to the broad range of salads to choose from (I like the spinach/apple/bacon number) and the KILLER sirloin chili (huge chunks of steak in there).  An extra $1 will get you the upgrade to the full bowl of chili.  Want to toss on half of a very decent chicken salad sandwich? Go for the Cap City Trio.  All of this can be yours for around $10 (but leave a decent tip for the bar-keep - he always provides excellent service while he dances, spins and sings his way through the lunch rush - high energy that dude is).My one ding on this location is the parking.....they seem to have five spaces which are always full during lunch.  Yes, there's ample parking all around, but it all has the ""Medical Center Only - you will be towed or killed or really need our services if you park here"" sign.",Brian D.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,11/17/10,"One word: meatloaf, yes, meatloaf. It is all you need at Cap City. I love the meatloaf, they do it good. Meatloaf sammies, meatloaf meatloaf, meatloaf fudge, meatloaf shakes, meatloaf ice cream...mmmmmeatloaf... *shakes head and wakes up*Yes, I threw my vegetarian ideals under the bus again cuz I just love the meatloaf. Oh, did I mention I love the meatloaf? Anyway, just about everything I've had from CC is delish. I love the turkey burger and the Monday special which is...wait for it...yes! you got it! MEATLOAF! Meatloaf gone wild, with gouda cheese, red onions and special mayo.I think the pastas are very good also. The desserts like cup-o-chocolate, key lime pie, apple pie like my granny made, and my fav of favs, creme brulee are to die for. Try creme brulee. I am a flan lover and creme brulee is very much like it. (Barnyard noises? What barnyard noises?)At the end of the meal our server asked if she could bring us anything else whereupon I remarked, yes, a bucket, some pepto-bismol and maybe a wet towel :)The service is wonderful. The staff is courteous and attentive. A nice casual joint. Now, for that bucket...",barb s.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,10/28/12,"Cap City is such a solid choice for me. It's not extraordinary, but it's always a consistently good experience. When I'm looking for good food, good drinks, friendly service, and fair prices, I can always count on Cap City to fit the bill.If you're going for dinner, get the pecan-crusted pork chops. Do it. Trust me on this one. Also amazing are the meatloaf and the romano-crusted chicken. And if you're there for brunch (my favorite!), then do yourself a favor and get the burrito. It's big, full of eggs, peppers, and cheese, and it's topped with a delicious red sauce.As for drinks, I'm partial to the Pine Fin. It's just Finlandia vodka that's been soaking for days in a big jug full of fresh pineapple. No sugar, no crap. And I prefer it ""up"" as a martini.Parking can be a bit of a bitch here, but just suck it up and do it. I promise it'll be worth it.Tip: Make a reservation on Open Table!",Bryant M.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2003/7/15,"The restaurant is quite deceiving from the front. It really looked like a small place but it was much larger inside. We had the crab cake appetizer and it came with a tomato,salad and a balsamic reduction and olive oil around the edge of the plate. The crab cake was delicious. Not too much filler mostly crabMy son ordered the pecan crusted pork chops and the serving was huge. 2 giant bone in chops. Cheddar mashed potatoes on the side. Very tasty. I ordered the fish and chips. Thick batter and 4 large pieces of cod with thin cut fries. Good, not great. It was very hot but the cod didn't have a lot of flavor on its own. I would still recommend it if you like thick pieces of fish. The best part of the meal was dessert. Warm banana bread pudding. Quite the mouthful of awesome sweetness. Honestly one if the best desserts I have ever had. The meals around me looked good too meatloaf and a crusted chicken dish with pasta.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,1/20/16,"I really like Cameron Mitchell restaurants but this one isn't managed as well as the others. The Maytag Blue Cheese Potato Chips are really good and so is the Peanut Butter Pie. I've tried a few different entrees here and haven't been totally crazy about one yet. My friend and I split the ribeye and the tilapia once, which was a good choice. The downside was we had pieces of broken glass in our water. I kept picking pieces out of my mouth before I realized what they were. We told our server but no one did anything but bring us new waters! The manager didn't stop over and no one talked to us about it. I went out to the bar on the patio and got new waters from them. Parking can be tight and there is usually a really long wait.

They have a beer flight option where you can taste 4 of their beers on tap.Service was very friendly, and we took suggestions on what to eat.  The Maytag Blue Cheese Potato Chip appetizer is an indulgence for sure, but delish. The dinner menu ranges from traditional comfort foods like meatloaf and fish and chips to typical diner burgers and sandwiches to more modern selections like a Thai Steak Salad.

It was okay..I meant to ask for it on a bed of spinach instead, but forgot. (my fault, but I suggest doing that unless you like mediocre iceberg lettuce with the occasional piece of spring mix.) The salad had a nice variety of toppings, but really wasn't worth $13 in my opinion. I want to like this place because it has so many good reviews. The service was good too.  Maybe the next time I should order something other than salad.

I usually just get a burger or sandwich, which are reasonably-priced, but I know I can get a proper martini as well.

And then the pieces of cake that may as well be called just cake.

Cap City has my second favorite salad in the city- the Two Apple Spinach Salad (not to be outdone by Greenbeans and Goodness at the TipTop). And they serve chicken pot pie on Tuesdays. Chicken Pot Pie! I love how they keep food simple, but innovative. I have actually never had a bad meal here.So that gets me in definite 4 star territory, but today did it for me. I had one of the most satisfying service experiences of my entire life... and I know that sounds kind of dirty, but in a strange way I do feel a little afterglowy. I was a waitress for 3 very long years and though I was fairly darn good at it, my waiter today put me to shame. He wasn't all up in my business, but always there when you needed him, incredibly anticipatory and exactly the right amount of friendly.Mitchell's restaurants do put a heavy emphasis on service and rightfully so.

It was our belated Valentine's Day dinner since he was a little 'under the weather' on Valentine's Day. We made reservations (highly recommended) and arrived a little early.

Um, hello people, its a CMR restaurant and you expect to get straight in on a Saturday night?!?!?  I had the Romano Crusted Chicken and it was delicious. The hubby had the cheese ravioli with the humongeous meatballs.

(A rare find when dining out.) Although I haven't tried other sandwiches (I assume they use the same GF bread for all, though), Cap City also has gluten-free options ranging from ruebens to BLTs to chili dogs...and salads, of course. My GF bun was a tad soggy, but considering it's the first burger I've bitten into with a bun in 3 years, I was perfectly content. I'd say my favorite part of the meal was the Tamarind Glazed Chicken Wings -- it's been awhile since I've found GF wings. And, might I mention, my friend & lunch date who isn't restricted by a gluten allergy also loved the wings and noted that he'd never guess they were GF. The fries were tasty, crisp, and JUST greasy enough to be addicting. The ambiance was nice, although I would have liked for there to be a TV in view so I could watch whatever sports games were on. It was a cold day when we went but the patio looked really comfortable, with a bar and heated outdoor seating.

(Side note: for anyone familiar with Cincinnati's old Diner on Sycamore, several things about Cap City reminded me of The Diner circa mid-late 90s)My wife and I and our 3 kids - 16, 14 and 7.  Full but not overly crowded, a couple tables waiting when we arrived 7:30-ish; made reservations an hour before arriving and got seated right away.  No problem parking but it was obvious that on a much busier night, parking could become an issue.Service was outstanding.  Hosts/greeters were prompt and friendly.  Our server was prompt and friendly.  Additionally, our server was informative without being pushy - she only offered her recommendations after we told her it was our first visit and murmured the usual ""everything sounds good"" plea for help.  A manager briefly popped by to see how things were going but didn't hover.  Drinks were refilled, plates removed, etc., in a timely and almost rhythmic manner by multiple employees.The food was very good.  We tried a variety of items and all were well prepared, generous portions.  The wings - crispy & meaty, not too spicy for most in my opinion.  Blue Cheese Salad - nicely dressed, fresh and crisp, and a very above average blue cheese dressing.  Meatloaf (sandwich), pork chops, and chicken all prepared spot on.  Chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes were excellent.  A nice beer selection also.All in all, this was a 4 - 4.5 star dining experience.  Kudos to Cap City!",Troy L.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,10/28/14,"Visited here last week for a birthday dinner with a small group of friends. The food was great, the service was not. We requested to sit in a corner as not to disturb the other guests; my group tends to be a little loud . We were sat in the middle of the restaurant though there were open seats in the back/corners. I was hoping to have a few drinks, as it was my birthday after all, but the waitress left our drinks empty for the majority of the night. We were there 7pm-10pm and our waitress came by the table 3x including when food was brought. You'd think you'd get better service when a 4 person party totals $250+ on a Monday outside of busy hours. As for the food, I had the ribeye and it was delicious. The mashed potato cake was awesome.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,6/20/15,"An infrequent misfire from the Mitchell Group.  We were a group of six close friends who dine together every two months or so.  This time, we were seated in the covered terrace, lovely on a Monday evening; that is, until an amateur, middle-aged group proceeded to plug-in their electric instruments, complete with deafening screeches, and to sonically assault us making it impossible to sustain casual conversation.  Intolerably loud, the performances were just shy of on-key.  Let's give them that they were lusty and spirited as if they were young tyros just freed from their parent's garage.  I'd have forgiven them had they been in their teens-to-early 20's.  Sadly they were not.  Our far-too-infrequent-group-dinner was figuratively taken hostage by a gaggle of middle-aged rock wannabes.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2010/8/11,"I accommodated the other half by attending an OSU hockey game last night. Since I was promised dinner afterwards and college hockey doesn't keep my attention, I spent the majority of the game playing with the Urban Spoon app, looking for just the right place to eat.   After a few 'shakes' of the iphone I realized that I had been dying to try both Alana's and Third and Hollywood which were pretty close by.  While trying to decide which place to go I looked down and realized I was wearing yoga capris, a tshirt and a fuchsia sports bra.  Yes, a sports bra on a Friday night.  Facts established, I decided something something more casual was in order.  A few shakes later and Cap City was locked in as the dinner destination. The atmosphere is playful and nostalgic with a large gumball machine and an upscale diner feel.  We sat at the bar and had plenty of room at 9:30 on a Friday which was nice.  I was a little underwhelmed by the drink selection because they only had 2 beers on tap: Stella and Yuengling.  And the wine prices seemed a little high (most glasses around $9-$10).  We settled on a Yuengling and the cheapest glass of red I could find which was $7.50.  While reviewing the menu the bartenders (yes there were 2 of them for a pretty small bar which was really nice). . . asked if we'd like some bread.  Really, do we look like the kind people who turn down bread? Bring on the basket! Unfortunately the rolls we got were a little dry like they'd been sitting under a heat lamp too long but regardless it was free bread so no harm no foul. The boy and I decided on the Ruben and the Philly cheese steak both served with fries.  Sandwiches were both good but I asked for mine to be served with cole slaw instead of sour kraut (yes, I make Sally from When Harry met Sally look low maintenance, when ordering food) and they forgot the slaw. Problem was quickly fixed though.  The 'blue cheese' slaw didn't really seem to have any trace of blue cheese flavor, but overall it wasn't bad.  The meat on the Reuben was really good and I think they make it 'in-house.'  The Philly meat was of the prime rib varietal and was really good.  The highlight of the meal was the banana bread pudding.  The bartender remarked that he had waited 3 years for Cap City to put this back on the menu and it was worth every second of the wait.  The dessert was huge of course, served in a large ice cream bowl.  A generous heaping scoop of bread pudding covered in caramel sauce, whipped cream, banana, toasted nuts.  This thing was the culinary equivalent of a snuggie- so warm and comforting it was hard to stop eating.  The bartenders were really attentive and friendly, food was more than mediocre and priced right, dessert was excellent.

On top of that, they serve complementary baskets of addictive cinnamon buns - I suggest limiting yourself to 1 of these...otherwise, you'll find that it was pointless to order anything else! other pros: retro atmosphere & super chill, nice waiters",Adrienne C.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2002/6/13,"I have so many fun memories from Cap City when I went to college, so I was so thrilled that going back ten years later, I find out that this establishment is just as top notch as it was then!  I went with two friends from out of town and we all got something different and all three were amazing.  Definitely recommended are the Ponzu Salmon and the Cap City Meatloaf!  I hope to make it back the next time I am in Columbus!!",Claire M.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2004/1/12,"I've been to Cap City twice within a week of each other and both times I have had an excellent meal. The food is very good and the atmosphere is pleasant.The first time I was introducing a friend to Cap City since he had never been there. We were sat in back in the greenhouse like section and my only real complaint there is that it was a chilly day and the baseboard heater along the wall was cooking my left leg as much as the kitchen was my chicken.I made it a point to stray away from my usual meatloaf ( which is excellent there) to give some of their other dishes a try. First visit I did the Romano Crusted chicken, that was so good it must have gave my stomach a high five once it got there. The second visit I went with the Philly Cheese steak which I enjoyed. It was served open-face but amount of meat, cheese and toppings made it impossible to close it and still be able to eat it like a respectable human.The new appetizers I tried were the quesadilla and the blue cheese chips. Both could almost be a meal in themselves if you don't share them. Each are delicious in their own style of cheesy goodness.Normally Cap City's main dishes leave me too full to try a dessert but this time the server must have been an expert in the ""upsell"" because I couldn't say no to trying the Creme Brulee. Despite the overly full feeling I was left with, I was glad I tried it because it was excellent. Well worth checking out if you get a chance.",Attila N.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,2002/1/12,"Cap City is sort of a conundrum for me. I feel comfortable and I enjoy the food overall when I eat there, but when I'm outside thinking of a place to eat, Cap City is rarely on my list of places to grab a bite.I've been here a couple of times, so the last time I was here I grabbed a couple of Cap City staples. For my app I munched on the maytag blue cheese potato chips. I despise plain chips, but smothering blue cheese on top of plain chips is almost a ""noble prize"" worthy contribution to the world. It's hard eating just 1 chip.Main course I tried their blackened tilapia po' boy. Very tasty, but the bread is a little thin, so much so that when you grab the sandwich  it became a smushed mayo/remoulade/tilapia sandwich mess. I ate it nonetheless.For dessert I had their creme brulee. Still very good, but it's starting to become pedestrian based on some of the creme brulees that I've tried in other restaurants around the city.Cap City is good food, but for me not always memorable.",George Y.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,2,2012/10/11,"Was visiting friends in Columbus last weekend and we went here on Sunday around 11 to grab a bit of brunch. I was less than impressed. The brunch menu is really, really limited. And what's with so many things made with ham? Our waitress was very kind, but the kitchen staff got my omelette wrong not once, but twice. I ordered an omelette with cheese, tomatoes, and green peppers only. The first time it came, it was LOADED with onions, the second time it came, it had ham in it. I decided against sending it back a second time and just picked around it. Although I don't live in Columbus, I do visit every so often, and I doubt I'll ever visit this place again simply due to the poor selection and that my food was done wrong twice.",Shakeia T.,,,,,,

I wouldn't call it a gem or fine dining at its best, but it's definitely interesting to see how they gussy up their food.  But personally?  When I want comfort food, I go for the real deal at home or in a greasy spoon diner.  I'd like to try their brunch sometime...  maybe that would bump me up to the 4 star level.",Cherie R.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2001/11/12,"Stuff White People Like #4356Cameron Mitchell RestaurantsDiners are supposed to be a egalitarian affair.  It's where blue collar workers of all races, shapes and sizes converge before and after a hard day's work to indulge in hash browns, eggs, and strong black coffee.  The fact that I did not see a single coal miner or prison guard at Cap City belies its label as a Diner.  Oh sure, Cam will insist, we put ""Fine"" in there in order to justify the high prices and the yuppy clientele.  Stated another way, Cap City is the gentrification of diners.  Cam has taken a piece of original classic Americana and transformed into a place that serves a $19 rainbow trout with risotto.  What the fuck is this shit?Nevertheless, I felt compelled to give this place a try.  And it's pretty damn tasty.  Cam is a professional.  The service at his restaurants is excellent and the execution is on point most of the time.  I got the Philly Cheesesteak with fries for $10.  The cheesesteak was fantastic and far better than what I had from Geno's and Pat's in Philadelphia (talk about worst all time tourist trap.  Anchor Bar is up there too).  The fries were nothing to write home about, which is kind of disappointing given how easy it is to make excellent fries.  Take potato, cut potato, put potato in hot peanut oil, take out potato, salt, serve.  I think the peanut allergy lobby is ruining french fries in this country.",Mike K.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,8/28/12,"Cap City is pretty great.  I first checked it out when I was in town for a day over the summer looking at apartments.  I was with my girlfriend, who is gluten-free, and being from out of town (Boston), I had no idea where we could go for good, reliable gluten-free food.  A cursory search of Yelp suggested Cap City, and so, cautiously and hungrily, we made our decision.Turned out it was a great decision.  Our server was tremendously knowledgeable about the menu and what could be made gluten-free.  As it turned out, the tamarind-crusted chicken wings were gluten-free (!), and they were FANTASTIC.  Perfectly crispy and spicy and flavorful.  For our entrees, we both got the pecan-crusted pork, which was equally fantastic - sweet, juicy and tender.  It came with chipotle-cheddar mashed potatoes, and some delicious spinach with shallot reduction or something.I went a second time with my parents when I moved to Columbus, and it was equally good.  I definitely will be going again, and will check out the other Cameron Mitchell restaurants.",Abe K.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,6/18/15,Cap city diner had a lot of good food choices to choose from. I ordered the Apple salad which was very good but ask for the dressing on the side because they drench the salad in dressing. They have buttered bread for an appetizer which was also good but drenched in butter. The restaurant is huge and has a great atmosphere. I would definitely go back.,Teri H.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,5/28/11,"Lunch yesterday was great.My dad and his wife were visiting from Florida for my son's high school graduation.  They told David he could pick where he'd like to go for lunch, and Cap City was his first choice.We went for lunch, but this was to be the main meal of the day.  Graduation was in the evening, so we figured we'd just have too much going on to worry about dinner.Everybody loved their dinners.I had the pecan crusted pork chop.  It came with spinach and chipotle mashed potatoes.  I've had it before and it was as good as I remembered.  The pork chop was tender and juicy.  I love the sweet pecan crust on it  The spinach was delicious.  The bright green just made the plate look so pretty, and made me feel virtuous.  Wish I could make spinach like that!  The chipotle taters were the perfect addition.  Since the pork chop had the sweet crust, the spicy kick in the potatoes was the perfect complement.My step mom, Judy, ordered the Ponzu Glazed Salmon with sticky rice, stir-fried vegetables and pineapple ginger sauce.  She tends to be a light eater, but she finished up all of the salmon and vegetables.  She left some of the rice...but only to make sure that she had room for dessert.  I'd say that was a ""yum"" for her.Son David had the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni (mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, poblano peppers and roasted red pepper cream sauce).  He's had this entree before, loved it...which was why he ordered it again.  And, I might add, polished it off.     Dad went for the Friday special, ""Joe's Shrimp and Slaw- battered fried shrimp and mustard slaw, with cocktail and tartar sauces.  It was right up his alley.  He was a little disappointed when he asked the server what ""went with it"", just to find out it was nothing else.  I think he expected at least some fries with it.  However,  when his dinner arrived and he saw how many shrimp were on the plate, he understood why he didn't need to fries.  They looked beautiful and he ate every single one of them.    Martin had the Crispy Fish and Chips (beer battered fish) which was served with Maytag blue cheese cole slaw, sweet pickle remoulade, and  French fries.  Again, the fish looked wonderful.  Like the shrimp, it looked lightly battered and golden brown.  Martin likes his fish and chips and said this was some of the best he's had.We all got dessert. David and Judy both had the peanut butter pie.  Said it tasted like peanut butter.  Wonder why.  Gone in seconds.  Okay, Judy's wasn't.  She's too well mannered.  But it still disappeared.Dad had apple pie with ice cream.  Also polished it off.  We tried to warn him about the size, but it didn't deter him.Martin and I knew better.  He ordered the carrot cake and had them bring it to the table already in a box.I ordered the banana bread pudding, which they kindly divided in half in the kitchen for us,  and I split it with Martin.  That stuff is so good...I'm not a banana pudding fan.  I'm not a bread pudding fan...But, somehow, I am a totally devoted fan of this dessert.  It doesn't make sense, but it's awesomeness is not easily surpassed.Go there.  It's good.Oh....and the carrot cake we polished off today.  Really good.  Almost as good as mine, but I didn' have to lift a finger.",Katherine B.,,,,,,

If you're looking to just have dinner, go elsewhere.  We had dinner at Cap City Grandview while in Columbus for an event.  It was conveniently located near our hotel and came highly recommended by the hotel staff.  Friends had also recommended ""any restaurant by Cameron Mitchell""  - and Cap City is one of them.  The restaurant was very busy but we had a reservation and were seated promptly.  The server was friendly and we followed his suggestion on what to order.  Surprisingly, however, when our food arrived -it neither looked nor tasted up to our expectations.  In fact, it was significantly less impressive than the random pub food we had for lunch in downtown Columbus (if you're downtown, go to Mac's in Short North -simple, casual pub/bar with great sandwiches).  Overall, Cap City was very disappointing.  I would not recommend this restaurant.  You could have better quality food - and less expensive - at Applebees / Fridays.  I assume based on his good reputation, that the other restaurants in the Cameron Mitchell brand are better...  but we decided to skip those after this experience.",C.

One negative was that one of my fellow diners asked whether he could have the sticky rice (which came with the ponzu salmon) with brown rice, but was told no. I think as a substitution this would have been simple, even if they weren't able to prepare it as ""sticky,"" and pretty common for customers nowadays to ask for brown rice and other healthier options.

Score.After already browsing the menu while waiting and reading Yelp reviews, I basically already knew what I wanted. Thanks, Kate H.

I'm still salivating. May I go back and have another?I know when I go back, I'll be tempted to order that again, but I must branch out, I must! The person I went with had the meatloaf and it looked de-lish! So. Much. Food. So. Little. Prices. Oh and can we discuss the cinnamon rolls? Yummm....And the service, just as you'd expect for a Cameron Mitchell restaurant.

I mean, the food is consistently good and though simple and comforting, is also so varied that everyone I take there can find something they like. It's also a cool place to just hang at the bar and partake of their yummy speciality drinks (or just wine, beer, or other stuff), and stuff your face with their homemade chips with blue-cheese sauce. People are generally in a good mood, and the service is rarely lacking. Mix all of this with a trendy, retro atmosphere, and really- it's a generally good time that can be had.Their portions are huge; thus, their prices (which aren't astonomical to begin with) are really fair. My faves are their blue cheese potato chips, tamarind wings, chicken milanese salad, black and blue salmon salad, pecan crusted pork chops, the Thursday blue plate special roast, chocolate peanut butter pie, banana bread pudding, and pretty much the rest of their menu if I feel so inclinedMonday nights they have had really good wine specials, and their happy hours offer discounts on their apps.If you're in the mood for a solid meal in an upbeat atmosphere, then Cap City's the place to be!",Mia H.,,,,,,

The pretzel with beer cheese was quite tasty. The complimentary buttered rolls are nice when warm, but not so much when they get cold. The pecan crusted pork chops were fine, nothing spectacular though. The Southern fried chicken arrived as two thin, boneless, pounded, fried chicken cutlets. We were so perplexed. How was this fried chicken? What was Southern about it? If this is how they're going to make it, chicken fried chicken would be a more appropriate name.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2012/11/11,"Cap City has a fun diner atmosphere and always seems to be packed, so there is a bit of energy in the air.  The menu features a variety of food, ranging from salads and sandwiches/burgers to home-style entrees with fun twists, as well as daily blue plate specials.On my most recent visit, there was a group of 6 of us.  We had a reservation and found ourselves seated promptly.  The server was helpful, attentive and upbeat, despite the number of people and tables on her hands.  All food was enjoyed - sampled were: the All-American Cheeseburger, the special Lobster & Shrimp Macaroni & Cheese, the Southern Fried Chicken, and the Romano Crusted Chicken.  The presentation was really nice, and the portions generous.  The sandwiches and burgers were large and filling, and came with choice of side ranging from the usual fries to a wild rice salad.  The mac & cheese special came in its hot skillet, still sizzling, on the plate with a side of mixed veggies including carrots and brussel sprouts.  Both chicken dishes looked fantastic, and came loaded with a generous serving of chicken.  The fried chicken arrived atop mashed potatoes and gravy, served with skillet beans, while the Romano crusted chicken was served over pasta.The gluten free menu had plenty of selections, and includes a beer offering, Red Bridge.  I opted to try the Cheddar Chicken BLT, as I was extremely interested in having an excuse to try the locally made gluten free buns Cap City offers.  The bread had a nice flavor and held up pretty well considering the chicken juices and BBQ mayo at work.  There are several sides to choose from, but I went basic with some fruit which came in a nice mix of melon, pineapple, grapes, etc.  Quite satisfying.Cap City is a solid place to get some good diner-style food with a twist and a great gluten-free menu.",Marissa C.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2003/12/15,"Had dinner with friends before a concert in the Arena district last night (as did many other diners!).  Should have made a reservation, but only waited about 5 minutes without one at 6pm, so not too bad.Happy hours goes until 6:30 so we were able to take advantage of Happy Hour pricing on a drink at the bar while we waited on our table. We were a little disappointed that happy hour pricing was only available in the bar area, not the entire restaurant.  The bar is on the smaller side, so it would be difficult for a group to head over after work and take advantage of the happy hour deals.Once we were seated, our waiter brought over waters and introduced himself.  We already had drinks from the bar.  After some discussion and a bit of a wait for our waiter to return we ordered, service was a little on the slow side we thought, for that time of night.  For appetizers we ordered the calamari and the warm pretzel. I did not try the calamari, but the others at the table must have really enjoyed it as there was none left.  The pretzel was delicious. Warm and soft, lots of salt. The mustard dip was spicy in all the right ways and the beer cheese dip was excellent, smooth and creamy.For dinner we each ordered something different, with varying degrees of satisfaction.  The grilled cheese sandwich was a big surprise for us. A generous triple decker, fresh bread, with a perfectly cooked fried egg. I tried a bite and was surprised at the flavor in that simple dish. The sandwich was accompanied by the jalapeno slaw which was excellent, but I wouldn't have minded a bit more jalapeno kick to it.  The All American Burger absolutely lived up to its name. Nothing fancy here, which was perfect.  A quality bun that held the whole thing together was much appreciated. Nice size beef patty, cooked to perfection at medium rare (one of the few places that will cook a burger to order) and all toppings were fresh and plentiful.  The burger came with fries and those were a bit of a disappointment.  With the quality of everything else, I was hoping for something a bit more memorable.  The pork chop came highly recommended and lived up to the hype.  Large cut of meat, beautifully prepared, very very tasty. The cheddar potatoes served with it were perfect.  The only dish we did not enjoy was the fried chicken which made all of us sad as that is the dish everyone was looking forward to.  First problem for us was that it was not whole pieces of chicken, it was two chicken breast fillets, pounded thin and breaded. The breading was a little heavy, the chicken was dry. The accompanying mashed potatoes and  gravy were quite delicious.  We had no room at all for dessert, but saw some great looking items go by.  We have dines here before and we will be back. Cap City is a solid Columbus staple,. definitely worth your time.  One thing to note, for those with handicap accessible needs, the parking lot is quite limited with handicap parking, but once inside, the wait staff is very accommodating.",Kris S.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,7/27/14,"Not only do I work at Cap City but I also love to dine here. For starters, the blue cheese chips are a must! Kettle chips, Alfredo, and blue cheese all put in the oven to create a tantalizing treat. Also, you can't go wrong with the pretzels and cheese. It's not your average appetizer as it comes with TWO HUGE pretzels paired with a beer cheese fondue and honey mustard. My favorite salad has to be the black and blue cheese salad which comes with blackened salmon on top or the BBQ chopped salad that includes yummy corn and cilantro ranch dressing. For sandwiches, I will always recommend the tender Reuben (pulled corned-beef?!) or the meatloaf melt and for a side dish the cottage cheese with applesauce topping. My favorite entrees are the spicy chicken rigatoni that is very rich with a little kick and the ponzu Salmon which I always finish.I'm absolutely in love with the salmon here in general because it is perfect every time. Any dessert will do as they are all huge and awesome but the banana bread pudding and milkshakes will always be on top.

This is a good place to bring out of towners (my dad was very impressed). Prices are a little steep in my opinion but it doesn't stop me from going!",Laura C.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,6/16/11,"Cap City is a standard favorite of mine.  It can be busy on the weekends and typical dinner hours, so make a reservation.  I like sitting in the front booth part for lunch and the back booths at dinner.They have a nice bar if you have to wait for a table or want to grab a drink first.  Since it's a Cameron Mitchell you can get my favorite, PineFin and sprite.  They have a big glass container that is filled with slices of pineapple soaking in Finlandia vodka.  Then you get a chunk of the pineapple in your glass.  It's delicious.My standard meal is the Romano Crusted Chicken.  It is so good.  I've made it at home (you can get the recipe off their website), but it's always better when they make it.  If you start with a salad or want to save room for desert, bring half of it home.  It reheats well in a broiler/toaster.I sometimes mix it up with Spicy chicken Rigatoni, which is also really good.  Thumbs up on the super buttery rolls as well.A couple of years ago they tried to change their menu and add a bunch of meals for 8-12 year olds.  I don't think it went over well, and they changed the menu back.  Thank goodness!  I like some variety, but I love the old standards.",Rachel W.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2010/4/13,"I recently ate at Cap City while in town visiting my sister. We had a reservation on a Friday night and the place was packed! We sat outside for maybe 5 minutes because we were early, and were seated right on time.Our waiter was a little...odd. Nice guy, but odd. We put in our drink orders, and I ordered a regular coke. He came back with a rum and coke. My mom saw that as a good thing and kept the drink, and he said he would return with my coke. He didn't, so when our app came out, my mom reminded him.We went to put in an order of the pretzels and the waiter just kept walking past the table and said ""I've taken care of that!"". We all looked at each other, a little puzzled. I guess its a popular item and he just assumed? I don't know, but we hadn't ordered it yet. Regardless, they were SO GOOD. Thinking about them now makes my mouth water. Every place should have soft pretzel apps. I did not enjoy the cheese dip on the side, but I can be picky about both cheese and toppings. Everyone else liked it.I ordered a chicken ceaser salad, which wound up being really big. The dressing wasn't my favorite - it wasn't too fishy or anything, but it was lacking in flavor. But overall the salad was yummy. One friend got a pasta dish - I can't remember which - and loved it. Everyone at the table tried it and wanted one of their own. I believe my mom got the Harvest Salad - I remember it had cranberries - and she loved it. I can't remember what my sister got, but she also loved it. She goes there often.For dessert, the 4 of us decided to split a piece of chocolate cake. Just do it. JUST DO IT.Wish I could visit this place regularly. I will be heading to Columbus again next year for my sister's wedding and will DEFINITELY stop in again.",Alex N.,,,,,,

We were there in between the lunch and dinner service, so it was not crowded at all. We ordered the Southern Fried chicken platter with mashed potatoes and green beans. Chicken was moist, and food came out quickly. However, our particular server ruined dinner. HE knocked over an entire glass of soda when he was putting our to-go desserts on the table. Accidents happen. No problem. I am still in a reasonably good mood. He immediately ran off and came back with towels. I stood up because my clothes were drenched. I foolishly assumed he was going to hand me a towel to attempt to dry myself off- especially since we were about to trek out into the snow. Nope. He used all of the towels to start cleaning the table. Shocked, I stood there a moment with my hands in the air- thinking he would notice that I needed something-anything- to dry off with.

While we do end up going there on an occasional basis (mostly for the gluten-free menu and ease of Paleo or specialty ordering) I have to admit that when the main dish comes out....I'm oftentimes filled with a sense of, ""Really? That's the best you can do?"" To be fair, the dishes I get are different...but they should still be good!  The basics of a great meal are on the plate!!    I would hope that a Chicken BLT (no bun) would still be pretty tasty....but each time I find that the chicken breasts are thin, overcooked and dry.  They're exactly the kind of chicken breast I'm sure GFS delivers frozen, in bulk.   I always order it without the cheddar cheese, so clearly the chef is counting on THAT to mask the stringy, dry chicken.  Couple that with the veg of the day - which has clearly been sitting in butter (not much of a healthy option, eh?) and the meal leaves me wanting.  It'd be pretty easy to amend, though.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,2,5/19/10,"I've never been to Cap City Diner, mainly because I drove past it once, and on it's sign it read ""Milkshakes and Martinis"" which sound disgusting together. I know they meant that they had milkshakes and they had martinis. Combined, it sounded like a really really terrible alcoholic drink.When I first walked in, I wasn't really sure what to expect. The crowd was a little older, and at first I felt under dressed although I'm not sure why. Maybe it is because I'm younger, and I get oddly conscious about these weird things. We had a brief wait even though we had a reservation. We were seated by the windows. Outside looked like a very nice patio that would be great for a summer evening. The light fixtures remind me of Saturn, and the decor mildly evoke a city scene without being ""Oh look it's called Cap CITY and we have CITY things!"" It didn't strike me as particularly classy nor particularly casual so neither too fancy nor super casual. I guess you could take it either way.Looking over the menu, I wasn't overly impressed. On the other hand, my dining companion is gluten free, and they have a gluten free menu, which is really awesome. The service was sort of odd. As a general rule with people and with servers, you shouldn't touch strangers. I've heard it several times, read it several times, and generally try to follow it as a server myself. Our server had a thing with touching our shoulders, which sort of weirded me out, just in general. This might just have been specific to our server. Also, when I received my coffee, the rim of the mug was encrusted with old dried up food, which was kind of gross. The coffee wasn't really impressive.My dining companion ordered the pork chops was very good, and I had the chili dog, which was fine. It wasn't very filling for my enormous appetite so we had dessert, which was fine. I don't generally have a huge taste for dessert anymore for some reason. I suppose I would try Cap City again, maybe a milk shake no martini, but I wouldn't have very high expectations.",Sara F.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2010/10/12,"Dear Food Hounds... I do believe that I have found a treasure... a diamond in the rough!  How often do you get a mixture of an upscale Restaurant, Diner, Bar and Gastropub all wrapped up into one?  Well, Brimstone is here to let you know; at Cap City Fine Diner and Bar in Columbus, Ohio - you've hit the jackpot!  At first glance, the front of the restaurant is set up like a Diner... well, a FINE Diner - offering patrons a clear view of the kitchen.  The high ceilings and art deco style of the architecture throughout the rest of Cap City offered a unique, open and comfortable vibe in the form of a high-class restaurant.  The booths are almost as big as the meals themselves as they fit five Hounds with ease!  We started with few drinks from the bar that were out of this world!  The Cap City Sangria (RED of course) was sweet and exploding with fruity flavor; possibly the best Sangria I've ever had - smooth and terrific with no aftertaste.  The Asian Pear Cooler tasted like a non-alcoholic orange-aid, topped with a small slice of the exotic Asian Pear.  The Strawberry Lemonade with Stoli Strasberi vodka, Cointreau, strawberry puree & freshly squeezed lemon had a secret weapon - basil; a fresh and different taste.  The Pineapple Finlandia had more than just a hint of pineapple... in this particular drink, huge chunks of cold pineapple soaked up the vodka flavor for noshing on after the drink was gone!On to the starting line-up... Cap City has a plethora of different items on their menu that are unique and equally as delicious!  Also, ALL the dishes are generously proportioned; nobody goes hungry here.  We were given a basket of their homemade Buttered Rolls which were fresh, warm and soft. Maytag Blue Cheese Potato Chips are a 'Cap City original' - crunchy, lightly salted chips drowning in a delicious river of Alfredo sauce and fresh green scallions!  Who'd have thought that Alfredo and Bleu Cheese could work in such harmony?  Thumbs up - WIN!  We had the Maryland Crab Cake which was a hearty size; more of a fishy flavored crab cake - but not overwhelming.  The slight spice came from the chili flake as the creamy basil aioli evens out the overall flavor behavior of the broiled lump of crab cake.  All hail the Tamarind Glazed Chicken Wings... WIN!  The crispy wings are stacked high, juicy and delicious while offering a light spice and a blast of sweet goodness - not Teriyaki; but similar.So, my WIN... the Blue Plate Feature; Cola Braised Short Rib!  No knife needed fork tender beef short rib to die for.  The meat literally just falls off the bone and melts in your mouth... I fell in love after the first intense bite!  The sauce is BOSS (especially over the cheddar mashed potatoes) and tasted like a blend of Cola, Dr. Pepper and grrrravvy to create a concoction that would please the masses.  The Balsamic Chicken had a beautiful presentation; a visual masterpiece with epic flavor behavior!  The breasts of chicken were SO soft and easy to cut with a tangy twist in every bite.  The buttermilk-chive potatoes were smooth, creamy and smothered with onion strings!  Talk about BIG... the Cap City Diner Meatloaf was off the proverbial hook with a little taste of home.  A thick slice of meaty awesomeness drizzled with an INCREDIBLE BBQ gravy that was paired with delish chili onion rings!!!  Next, crispy Romano Crusted Chicken with moist garlic buttered noodles drowning in a roasted tomato cream sauce.  The Romano cheese encrusted chicken patties were thin and unbelievably flavorful, crunchy and tasty.  The Southern Fried Chicken sported a perfectly deep fried, crunchy, battered breast of poultry that was juicy, tender and moist in the middle.  Also, the sweet fresh veggies were brightly colored and uber-good!  I LOVED the NY Strip Steak with cheddar-chipotle mashed potatoes and chili steak sauce.  Hint - dip the 'tatoes in that sauce... YUM!  The sauce is BOSS; sweet and tangy - utterly delicious.  Lastly, the Knife and Fork Chili Dog turned out to be a big, bad and killer concoction of yummy goodness... a Cap City tradition; this sliced hot dog is stuffed with shredded beef and/or pork, and then drizzled with cheddar, red onions and bright green scallions!  WIN!Everything on their dessert menu is housemade & GINORMOUS!  The Seriously Big Chocolate Cake; a 3-layer chocolate cake that was twice the size of my head!  SO scrumptious I could hardly contain myself!  The Cap City Diner Pie of the day was a kickin' Pumpkin Cheesecake that was smooth and creamy.  The Warm Banana Bread Pudding came in a goblet-sized bowl and was filled to the rim with caramelized banana, candied pecans, fresh whipped cream and a beautiful bourbon sauce that we just couldn't get enough of.  To top it all off... the 24K Carrot Cake - hands down WIN!  This thick and rich flavored carrot cake was sweet and moist; probably in the top three best I've had in Food Hound history.  They deserve a round of applause for this winner. VERY recommended.",Will K.,,,,,,

We ordered the mussels, even though I am slightly scared of Midwest seafood - and I was pleasantly surprised! They were actually quite delicious. What was really nice was the amt. of time we were given to mull over the dinner menu, giggle and chat, and chomp on some well-seasoned and not overcooked (two things I worry about in Ohio) mussels. When we finally ordered dinner, we were relaxed and happy, and decided to share the meatloaf... because, not gonna lie, we watched some elderly lady, bless her heart, consume said entree and decided we wouldn't be able to finish it alone. It is ginormous. Even more adorably, it was brought to us split in half, on two seperate plates - a thoughtful touch that not all restaurants will do. And it was very delicious! The gravy in particular sticks out as nom-rific. YUMMM. Oh and we took some to-go chocolate cake with us to O'Reilly's to share with our friends, who all loved it (it is also HUGE and DELICIOUS)! Overall, a lovely experience - excellent food, service, and company.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,1/30/10,"Cap City used to be a staple for me. I'd take my family there when they were in town and we'd always really enjoy what we ordered.However, the last couple times I've been there both the quality of the ingredients as well as the portion sizes have both gone down. Cap City is far from being horrible, but it pains me to have to put it in the category of ""Columbus institutions that have lost their edge due to their use of cheaper ingredients and becoming too big of a franchise for their own good"". (Try putting THAT on a T-shirt.) One of the best examples I can give would be the Maytag Blue Cheese Potato Chips: They used to taste like fresh potatoes had been sliced and deep fried, and the blue cheese was of fairly high quality. Now they taste like they're frying frozen potatoes in oil that's been sitting around all day, and the quality of the blue cheese seems much less desirable and cheap. There are a couple dishes that haven't changed much. One of them would be the ""Knife-and-Fork"" Chili Dog. It was never a spectacular dish by any means, but the spicy dog/sausage always hits the spot whenever I order it. If the restaurant was the way it used to be about 7 or 8 years ago, I'd be happy to give it a higher rating.",Sean S.,,,,,,

It wasn't even a busy day. I ordered the same thing I had (Thai steak salad) and while the first time it was delicious, the second time my steak was quite burnt and tasted like charcoal. Unpleasant to say the least! I wish Cap City were more consistent because it has a lot of potential to be a good restaurant for large groups and strays from the common chain restaurants.",Lydia W.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2006/7/12,"It's been a while since I've been here.  And it didn't disappoint, just like I remember.  This is a diner, spruced up Cameron Mitchell-style.  Great service.  Great food.",Jeff P.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2004/8/13,"This was my first time dining at Cap City.  Ive heard fantastic things so I was please to finally be getting to give it a try.We had a reservation but arrived early to have a drink at the bar-the bartenders were attentive and friendly.  We both had a Bulleit Rye manhattan, something we order regularly, and i must say at $11 a piece it seemed sssslightly over priced considering there was nothing amazing about it. Not as good as some manhattans we've had other places. but hey, no big deal.Our server was ADORABLE and very good at her job. The poor girl probably thought I had a crush on her because I think I told her 12 times how freakin cute she was.We had the Calamari to start and I will say-I wasnt overly impressed.  It was tossed in a sauce, and I would have much rather had the sauce on the side. Im weird about sauce.  Beyond that, an average plate of Calamari.For our main dishes we got the meatloaf and the philly cheesesteak sandwich.  The meatloaf was OUTSTANDING!! Im sure those mashed potatoes had more butter and salt in them than I'd like to know-but my heavens who cares. they were SO good.  The philly was dubbed by the fiance ""possibly the best one in the city,"" and I must say I enjoyed it very much as well.  I also had 2 glasses of wine and the man had 2 beers and we were very pleased to get a bill under $65.They also have an ""open kitchen"" with seating where you can watch all the magic happen.  Next visit im going to grab one of those spots and try something else!  All in all a great experience and we will be back!",KariLou H.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,9/15/10,"As a soon to be senior at OSU, I'm trying to hit up as many Columbus favorites as possible before I graduate. The other night, we decided to go to Cap City. Walking in, you're greeted by a huge gumball machine (which is purely decorative to our dismay). The decor here is a-ok. It feels like a diner, mixed with your typical slightly upscale chain restaurant. Once you're seated, an average sized menu awaits you. You can get appetizers, salads, sandwiches, or large plates. I ended up getting the meatloaf sandwich and it was QUITE good. Very sweet meatloaf, on great bread with cheese...how can you go wrong? My friends got the Balsamic Chicken (great) and the Fish and Chips. Although I didn't try them, my friend noted that the mashed potatoes weren't all that great.We ended up trying desert too. Our Peanut Butter Chocolate Pie was excellent. It's definitely big enough to share, so I would recommend that any chocolate peanut butter fanatic like myself try it!Now the negatives. Our server was downright bizarre. He said maybe three words to us and was constantly creeping around our table. The only time I saw any emotion out of him was when my two companions ordered $8 mixed drinks. He also didn't tell us the specials, which we all agreed we probably would have gotten had he provided us with them.  Also, I felt like the entrees were slightly pricey for what they were. My sandwich felt like a good value, but my friend paid way too much for her Fish and Chips.Overall, I did enjoy Cap City Diner. If I could give it a 3.5 stars, I definitely would. But nonetheless, if you're looking for a typical American restaurant that's a step up from the likes of Champps, give Cap City a try.",Brett F.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2002/12/10,"The Place: Cap City is a fairly large restaurant. There are several different sections: a traditionally styled diner-type area with a counter near the front, and large dining rooms on the north and west sides of the building. There is also patio seating available in the warmer months. Aesthetically speaking, the interior is fun. It's got elements of the diner atmosphere, and elements of the fine dining atmosphere. It's comfortable and pleasing to the eye. The Food: I've been to Cap City twice, and both meals I've had have been very good. The only appetizer I've tried is the Maytag Blue Cheese Potato Chips. I was a bit dissapointed in them because the chips seemed straight out of the bag. I've had blue cheese chips at The Olde Mohawk and Bodega that tasted twice as good because the chips were (or appeared to be) fresh and homemade. In terms of entrees, I've had both the Jake's Famous Reuben and the Meatloaf Melt. The Meatloaf Melt came on rye bread with meunster cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and mayo. I wasn't crazy about the meatloaf, as it was a bit too sweet for my tastes. Overall, though ,the sandwich was pretty good. The reuben was probably the best I've ever had. It was piled very high with great-tasting corned beef, and complemented with delicious sauerkraut and dressing. The sandwich was huge, to boot. I ordered both sandwiches with fries, and they were good, but nothing to phone mom about. I have yet to try it, but it should be noted that they have a HUGE piece of chocolate cake on the dessert menu. (It's appropriately named the ""Seriously Big Chocolate Cake"") All of the desserts I've seen pass by have looked amazing, and I'm looking forward to trying a few in the near future. The Drinks: comments after next visit. The Service: The servers at Cap City are fantastic. They know their stuff, and are attentive to your needs. Your glasses are full, and they take care to make sure you are enjoying your meal. Two thumbs up!The Price: I like the prices on the sandwiches. By virtue of being huge and delicious, a $9 price tag is a-ok with me. I think the dinner plates are a bit overpriced, but for the service and the atmosphere, the over-pricing is admissible. Overall: Cap City provides a fun atmosphere, fantastic food options, great service, and fair prices. I had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars, but I went with 4 because of my dissapointment with the Blue Chips, and the pricey dinner plates. If I could give Cap City a 4.5, I surely would. Highly recommended.",Jay D.,,,,,,

The Romano crusted chicken is delicious as well.  We always start out with their famous maytag blue cheese chips and even though I don't like blue cheese, I love them!  And for the grand finale, the seriously big chocolate cake is the best cake ever!!  It is moist (especially if you ask them to warm it up! ) and is large enough for a good 4 people to share.

It came with a mustard vinegrette which I asked for more of it.  For my entree I had the meatloaf.  There was a LOT of it.  I didn't even finish it.  Probably could have skipped the salad.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2001/2/10,"I've never been here for dinner.  This is more one of those places that you go to for lunch to get away from the office for a bit.  Its quick service means that you won't be missing too much work but its still a nice relaxing visit with some pretty good food.  I also like to come here when its someone's birthday because dessert for the birthday boy or girl is free.  That makes it nice to treat someone to lunch and still feel like your getting a treat in return.If possible, try to get a seat outside on the patio.  Its just nice to eat outside and not be inside where the open kitchen causes a bit of hustle and bustle.  The meatloaf is an especially favorite dish of mine and anything with chocolate on it in the dessert menu is worth trying.  I have heard that they have a wonderful brunch menu that I hope to be trying next.",Amy S.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,2,4/18/11,"To begin; the rolls that are covered with fake butter....yuk is really all I can say. I ordered the reuben for my meal and I got the cole slaw to go with it. The slaw was ok, but nothing really special, but the corned beef was the best part. It was really tender, and if I could hijack the meat and place it on another rueben that I enjoy so much at another place out of town, then this sandwich would have been perfect for me. The bread is just eh, and if you like sour kraut as much as I then you will be sad upon tasting what I feel is just plain and tasteless cabbage. If/when I go back I might try an entree, but for a few more dollars I can go right over to high street and hit my favorite restaurant.",Cindy R.,,,,,,

Would go back again and try a different table.",Ken E.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,3/27/09,"I love Cap City. I can never pass up the two apple spinach salad.  My favorite main dish is the pecan crusted pork chops. If you save enough room for dessert, there are some great options, but plan to share or take some home because they are huge.The service is consistently wonderful. That is pretty standard across Cameron Mitchell restaurants, and really does make them stand out.  I'm very tempted to give 5 stars, but I'm holding back because of the prices and because I have had a couple dishes here that missed the mark (the tilapia sandwich was a bit dry).",T _.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2002/1/13,"Very very very good.  I have tried both the meatloaf and the Romano chicken on 2 separate occasions.  I was impressed.  The meatloaf is alot, it is their specialty and if your into meatloaf, I highly recommend it. However, I must say that that I enjoyed the Romano chicken better.  It's lightly breaded with a killer a la vodka sauce accompaniment.  I've had apps here, highly recommend the wings and the blue cheese alfredo chips.  The chips are decadent but delicious you have to share them.  The wings are very good as well and goes great with a beer.  If you go at happy hr the apps are half off.  Now for dessert...get the CARROT CAKE...amazing in all honesty and its so big you'll eat 1/3 and take the rest home.  If your a chocolate lover I hear the choc cake is very good its 3 layers like the carrot cake and stands a mile high.  The only other dessert that I tried was the cup o chocolate which is a warm lava shaped double choc cake in a large bowl that comes with vanilla bean ice cream.   Very very good and a smaller choice then the gigantic cakes.   I have not had a bad thing off of their menu.  Highly recommended restaurant; one of my favs in Columbus by far. They also have free wi-fi and great happy hr specials during the week.",Dr W.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2001/10/9,"One of my favorite places to eat for a fancy dinner. The Romano Crusted Chicken is to die for. If it's warm, try to sit outside, because it's very pleasant.Let 'em know it's your birthday, and they'll usually bring out a complimentary piece of cake.If you do get cake, understand that you alone will not be able to finish it. So bring a friend.",Kiesha J.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2/15/09,"As I continue to experience ""Yelp"", I am utterly amazed at the educated people here who think that a Cameron Mitchell restaurant will be offering diner grub at a bargain price.  If you simply drive up to the place, and view the extensive patio area and the bar, I think you may be able to figure out that this is no ""Nancy's"", ""Chef's House"" (a Hilliard favorite) or the ""Goody Boy"".  I do not know of a diner with alcohol service either - unless it's a ""pub""....In my opinion, you can get a great meal here that is imaginative, served with flair. it is a coffee shop turned finer diner with the front dining room resembling a dining car, while the back room is large and open with high ceilings and a very cozy fireplaceA quick run down on the pricing and the menu:Appetizers - Maytag Blue Cheese Potato Chips to Boiled Shrimp - priceed between $6 and 10.00.  Big portions - easy to share...Salads - cool, fresh ranging from side portions to entree sized, priced from $5.00 to 10.00 - Next ttime, why not share a side salad with your entree - no one says you have to have a whole one for yourself, especially if you have another big food plate coming?  I suggest teh 2 apple/spinach salad.Sandwiches - Burgers, Ruebens, Clubs (with salmon if you like), Turkey Burger, Meat Loaf Melt - priced between $6.00 and 10.00.Entrees - Romano Crusted Fried Chicken, Pecan Crusted Pork Chops, Ponzu Glazed Salmon,  Meatloaf - thick sliced, piled high with potatoes and vegetable - not your typical 80/20 hamburg here....Daily specials.  All entrees come with two AMPLE side dishes - if you don't like the sides listed, feel free to ask for a substitution.  Entree prices are $12.00 to 20.00.  To me - the portions are AMPLE - I eat half my entree and take the other half home for the next day - that usually doesn't happen at the other diners for me.  Fantastic sides - sticky rice, pasta cake, buttered noodles, various mashed potato blends with cheese and peppers, skillet green beans (steamed with pecans and red peppers), spinach saute with shallots and tomato - excellent, FRESH preparationsEven better - you can ask for the ""Lunch"" portion - half the entree  priced between 8.00 and 14.00.Deeserts - wow - huge portions once again - really ""BIG"" chocolate cake, carrot cake, apple pie with almond crust, cherry pie, ley lime tart, Bananas Foster, Bread Pudding..  Most are priced between $5.00 and 7.00.  I guess I don't take offense to the pricing for this eclectic food like others do.  In my opinion, their prices are not out of line with any casual dining chain restaurant you might flock to - and there is the opportunity to eat cheaper with a side salad and an appetizer, a sandwich, a shared entree, etc.  I find the alcohol pricing to be comparable with any other restaurant with a full bar - if that's too prohibitive - maybe drink before dinner?  I assume you must have some disposable income - because you are eating out.  Even the 5 star chicken finger place charges you $8.00 for a sooped up meal - and you likely feel hungry after eating it.As for your dress code - I wore jeans and a sweater tonight.  I saw jeans and tennis shoes,  If you go on Sunday morning for brunch - yes you will see some people dressed - likely because they are coming from Church.  I can say the same thing for First Watch or my local Bob Evans...The menu is creative - stretch your limits - order something fun instead of the entree salad - there are plenty of healthy offerings without having to resort to the salad like other posters.  Stop your whining, order something interesting, enjoy the excellent and accomodating service, and full bar if you've got the cash.  Great outside dining when the weather is nice!  Just enjoy the very reason you go out to dinner - great tasting food.",Dan D.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,1/20/12,The blue cheese potato chips are sinfully good along with the Romano Crusted chicken.  The Roman chicken is a very large portion - so it is best to share to save for a meal the next day.,Cathy W.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2011/11/8,"By far my favorite all around restaurant in Columbus.  The food is moderately priced for the quality.  Larry, if he is still the head chef (he is!), is great at creating amazing comfort food of outstanding quality.  If you order a plate you likely won't spend over $17, and if you go the sandwich route, you'll be walking out under $10.  Cameron Mitchell isn't a self-made millionaire for nothing.   Unless you catch your server on a terrible night, you will probably get some of the best service you've ever had.  Cap City has the same standards as Cameron's or any of CMR's other locations, but with a slightly better price because it is, after all, a diner.  The Sunday brunch is the highlight of Cap City, in my opinion.  So many amazing omelet options, fantastic cinnamon rolls (instead of dinner rolls), great fresh fruit, specials, I could go on.  Each night has a blue plate special, as well as a nightly special.  Furthermore, I don't even like meatloaf, but Cap City has, and I absolutely mean this, the best meatloaf on the planet.  Yes, it is better than your mother's.  I'm sorry, it's true.They usually feature a few seasonal beers at the bar, nothing too fancy though.  Like all CMR joints, it has a drink menu, amazing desserts and a dessert drink list featuring coffee drinks and ports.  It is also great for large parties and kids.Oh, also, for summer months there is a great patio that features live jazz on Friday nights.I take all of my out-of-town friends here at least once.  They walk away full and happy.",Luke T.,,,,,,

If you ever stop here and get dinner, lunch or breakfast I would suggest the Maytag Blue Cheese Potato Chips and Old Bay Peel and Eat Shrimp as appetizers.

As with all 'fine'dining you get what you pay for.I would not consider cap city fine dining but the quality ingredients are superior to what you would find at a traditional diner.The interior is fun and a bit kitschy. The menu is a crowd pleasure as well as the cheese covered chips as a group starter.I like small plates so I always USED to get the corn and chees risotto that was recently dropped from the menue with a side of vegetarian chili.There are not many vegetarian options but if you ask, like I do with the chili they will accomodate.Deserts are huge and delicious. I usually split the apple pie with a partner.Don't expect a greasy spoon at cap city or a check under $50 for two, but it is well worth it.",doreen w.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2003/1/9,"What makes Cap City Diner so great is how owner Cameron Mitchell gives you a high-end service experience in a super-casual setting.  It makes you feel like you're a great meal without the uncomfortable formality of an upscale restaurant.  You can feel the value for the dollar.Get the Romano Crusted Chicken.  It's pan-fried chicken breasts on spaghetti with a tomato sauce.  The sauce makes it great.  I don't know what they put in it, maybe a bit of cream?  It has this punch to it that's absolutely addicting.  The lunch portion is smaller than the dinner portion (two chicken breasts vs. three).  It makes top-shelf leftovers.The peel and eat shrimp are excellent appetizers, and the Long Island Iced Tea is the wife's drink of choice.  Either the deep dish apple pie (how do they do that?), or the seriously big chocolate cake are musts if you still have room (get 'em to go if you don't).",Gabriel M.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,4/29/13,"Would I ever not give this place 5 stars? Is the Parmesan chicken one of the best dishes I have ever eaten? Does the chocolate covered peanut butter pie make this my favorite eatery in Columbus? Will I stop asking rhetorical questions that you probably already know the answer to ? No, Yes, YYEEEESSSsS, and not in this review.The only time I had a ""bad experience"" at this restaurant was when a waiter forgot to take our order and ended up waiting 20 minutes to place our order. The reason I put sarcastic quotes around bad experience is this only happened once and because the waiter gave us two free desserts in the restaurant and begged us to take something else home. 99 out of 100 times I get the Parmesan chicken and the other one time I got the meatloaf and 100 out of 100 times I am very satisfied. The chicken is fried and lays over buttered noodles and i think there is some type of creamy dressing in between the chicken and the fried layer. ( This is not a complaint). The meatloaf is a little heavy for my taste especially on top of a thick piece of bread and comes with broccoli (Really?) but when you want a solid meatloaf, pull into cap city and then tomorrow whilst running on a treadmill think to yourself it was worth it.To summarize,is this the best restaurant with the finest quality ingredients, probably not but I have gotten a great meal every time  and is perfect if you want slightly upscale dinner food.",JJ P.,,,,,,

I hadn't been here for several years but I was back in Columbus to see my family and I thought it would make for a nice place to take my mom and sister for lunch.  The place was packed so i thought it had to still have the same quality of food that I had known several years ago.  I was wrong.  Everything was bland. Greasy and just not worth it.  I would put it on the same level of Cheesecake Factory.  All the sandwiches taste the same and they appear to be going for more ""quantity"" than ""quality"".  This place has fallen far.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,2001/2/9,"I love Cameron Mitchell restaurants across the board, but of all the concepts, this is my least favorite. It's not a reflection of the food or even the popularity with so many others, but it's just my personal opinion. A diner is an interesting American concept, yet I can't connect with the idea of an 'upscale', somewhat overpriced ""diner"". It's hard to leave Cap City with a $75 bill, feeling like you had a diner experience... but ahhh... remember the name is Cap City FINER DINER. That's the catch! The food is awesome and WELL worth the $75 bill, which we just had last night. I may not patronize Cap City as often as some folks, but I'd say once a quarter is enough to recognize I drop a pretty chunk of change every time I eat here. But I'm OK with it. Just be advised... it is not your greasy spoon diner. The booze, on the other hand is overpriced (especially, when I just want a casual dining experience), but Cap City's happy hour is another thing. Certain appetizers are on sale, as are a handful of drinks. Not the most generous discounts, but if you like the atmosphere, it's certainly worth a visit between 4 and 7. We just had dinner here last night and were seated in the ""original"" diner section (as opposed to the dining room), which we speculated could have been inspired by the original hotel diner previously located in the same area of this building. We also thought the 80's-ish music, which is not what one would expect to be playing at a ""traditional"" diner, was nostalgic enough to evoke a newer ""diner ambiance"". Interesting and updated idea. I like that Mitchell takes what could be an outdated concept and gives it a new and modern twist. My only complaint: The tableside service (including last night) wavers between mediocre and good, but I've always had great bartender service. Our server last night more or less tossed our food on the table and ran off, but everything came out piping hot and tasted great. I stand firm in my three star review based simply on the fact that I have had five star service at other Cameron Mitchell restaurants.

I've wanted to come here for brunch for a while now but the menu looks so ordinary--boy was I wrong about the ordinary part. Yes, Cap City has an all-American menu, but they just do it better. Lunch hour was pretty busy and we were seated in the ""3-season porch""--it was pleasant and quiet and warm too. My dining partner had the Philly cheese steak and it was huge. He couldn't fold the sandwich together so ate it open with a knife and fork--I have a feeling that all of their sandwiches will be like this. I had the salmon with rice and it was delicious. The sauce was sooo good and rich--I think there was a ton of butter in it, very un-Asian (as it was supposed to be Asian salmon), but it was so good that I don't care. I ate most of the rice in the restaurant and had only fish left so when they packed my box, they put extra rice in there for me! Now that's great service :) The bread came out after the main courses did but I didn't really mind--the bread was good but smothered in butter. The reason I give this location only four stars is because parking is a b****. They share a small front lot with Ohio Health offices and the back lot is precarious. I can't wait to try some of their more populat dishes next time.",Arafina B.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,7/22/08,"This is one of those places that is worth all the hype it receives. Cap City Diner is a perfect combination of classy ambiance and approachable food (tamarind glazed chicken wings, steamed mussels, their famous gourmet meatloaf).The prices, particularly at lunch, are very reasonable for the serving size and presentation. The atmosphere is great. You feel like you're eating at a much nicer (and more expensive) place than you really are. Crowds can get out of hand at the Grandview location. The Gahanna location is much easier to get into. Enjoy.Of all the Cameron Mitchell restaurants, this is my favorite.",Randy S.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,2,8/25/08,"Cap City Fine Diner bills itself as a diner that's also upscale. Wait, what?That's not a very good concept to me. The whole reason for diners is to get bad food, hopefully fast, some bad coffee, hopefully often, and a touch of class from sitting in a greasy, cramped little dive where the locals are loud, the regulars are rude, and if you're lucky, a few truckers will offer to give you Bibles- it happened to me!None of that's going to happen at Cap City. It's all way too much. It's too dark to be a diner. The booths are too high backed. The music is too obvious. It's really nothing like a diner, even in passing- at least visually. The menu does have some sort of semblance to diner food- I guess I've seen a few diners serve meatloaf (eggs are fare more common, right?). It's just kind of nothing like a diner. The food- it's not bad. The meatloaf I had didn't strike me as anything all that more extravagant than any other meatloaf I've had. The onion rings were a nice touch, but - well, for a few less dollars it'd have been pretty awesome, actually. But the prices are far more north of diner fare than the actual fare offered.But at the end: a huge cup o' chocolate. I'm pretty sure that's fairly close to the real name on the menu. It was huge. It was o' chocolate. And it was delicious- I had to share it three ways, but we finished it. And I wanted more, although I knew it might kill me.Cap City, you confound me. You creeped me out the whole time I was there with your weird, gothic take on a diner. But I liked your food. Even loved dessert. Couldn't you make this easier on me?",Matthew B.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2001/12/9,"This is, by far, my favorite restaurant in Columbus.The lunch prices are amazing when you take into account the amount of food you get. The food is also fantastic. I don't think I've ever had anything I wouldn't eat every bite of if I had the stomach capacity. The meatloaf is of course incredibly note worthy. And I've always been impressed with their appetizers. The potato chips are wonderful, just enough blue cheese to give it a little bite. The wings are fab. I really love the sauce they use on them.I'm a huge fan of Cameron Mitchell restaurants. I wish I could find something like them in Boston. The service is always fast and friendly, the atmospheres are cute and always appropriate and the food is to die for. I love me some Cap City!!Oh, and if you need somewhere to listen to jazz, sit out on a porch and drink a beer, you've got it at Cap City. Their outdoor seating area is rather fantastic, especially if you get a wedge salad to nom on. Mmmmm.",Andra G.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,10/13/08,"Firstly, don't come here expecting diner prices.  My boyfriend and I once spent $70 here for two drinks, an appetizer, two entrees and a piece of pie.  Cap City is an ""upscale"" diner and is priced accordingly.I've had both the vegetable plate (which i do enjoy, since I tend to get bored with a big entree - the plate offers a few different things like pasta, veggies, and a spring roll) and the huevos quesadilla and while both were fine, neither was particularly impressive.  The brunch dish did provide a lot of food between the quesadilla, the included side of fruit, and the yummy rolls that are on every table.  Cap City's brunch has a good mix of breakfast food, sandwiches, and heartier entrees - sure to please any group.Service has always been very good here.  This was an excellent choice for my family when they were visiting - it's close to campus but not overrun with hungover undergrads, the service is good, the food is better than cafeteria food and in my experience you'll get a table faster than you would at Bob Evans.Overall, not my favorite restaurant in Columbus (or even my favorite Cameron Mitchell restaurant) but the brunch is probably the best of the restaurants close to campus.",Emily H.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2005/6/9,"I heart this place. It's awesome for parties big and small. The food comes in enormous portions so that you can always take the leftovers for lunch the next day. I can't say that I have had a bad meal here. The chicken parm is great; you get like 4 chicken cutlets! The chocolate cake is gimormous. I also love the Sunday brunch menu. They serve it with glazed cinnamon rolls that are gooey and to die for. The servers are super accommodating. My bridesmaids had planned a shower on the patio for me during GRADUATION week, so you know it was super busy. Well, it ended up raining so they moved our entire party inside without blinking an eye.

What better way to end a day of endless walking then with some good old comfort food? I ordered the Basil Lemonade for my beverage and it was very tasty, a different twist on the typical lemonde. For my entree I ordered the Romano Chicken which was your typical crusted chicken but very good nonetheless. For dessert I had the bread pudding which was excellent, I had to restrain myself from licking the dish. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the experience in general and our server was very attentive and honest regarding menu suggestions. I wouldn't rate this high on the ""value for price"" scale. Our bill was hovering right around $100 mark for three of us including tip and not one of us had cocktails!

Admittedly, I've only ever had the meatloaf (delicious!), but he's had the fish sandwich, the Romano crusted chicken, and the Reuben, and always been extremely satisfied. I recall the steamed mussels being really good too. Prices are definitely reasonable imo.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,2003/9/11,"Usually I would give this place another star, but on this particular occassion we had the WORST server ever. I wish I would have gotten her name so I could warn everyone, but she was so off putting I didn't really care.Drink orders wrong, empty glasses at the table, not caring about us, etc... which would have given any other restuarant a much lower scale, but here despite the fact that we had some bitch serving us we had a good time amongst friends and the food was excellent. Keith dined on his usual Balsamic Chicken. He expects them to mess it up each time he gets it because it is such a great dish for him, but they never do. Todd ordered the Raviolli, which was something I was considering doing, and it is large cheese filled squares with huge meatballs. Matt had the Meatloaf sandwich- an open faced sandwich that is served with mashed potatoes on top. It is a mystery to me how he does it. I had the Oriental Salad, which was very good, but I suggest that you order the dressing on the side since they seem to drown the salad in it. A fact that I have learned that a lot of Columbus restaurants do.Atmosphere is nice, Causal dining. I am not sure why some family decided to bring their small children out at 10pm, but I am not Children Services so I can't really comment on poor parenting now can I! So, all in all, despite lack luster service we had a great meal, and a nice time.",Robert T.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,5/20/13,"To be honest, being a Cameron Mitchell Restaurant, I had higher expectations. Food was okay. For the price, nothing spectacular. Definitely wasn't blown away. This place is always busy on the weekends, though, so maybe I'm way off base. Be sure to make reservations if you're going on a Friday night, the wait can be brutal! Love that you can reserve a table via Yelp. Made dining a lot easier!",Robby C.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,1/24/09,"I guess I had pretty high expectations for Cap City. You always hear such great things about Cameron Mitchell restaurants and I had never been here before. A couple of friends and I decided to come here one Sunday afternoon for lunch.It's located in a good spot - right on Olentangy River Rd so it's easy to spot. It's also kind of big and hard to miss.We went in and sort of felt out of place. This place was a bit fancier than we expected. I think the word ""diner"" in the title through us off. We were all hungover and wearing our clothes from the bar the night before. Yeah, it was one of those Sundays. To sum this experience up, I'll just say that we would have been better off going to our regular First Watch.But we were seated anyway. I guess we didn't look too bad. It was really pretty in there, but also very bright. One of the walls was all glass, and that allowed you to see right onto the patio where many people were seated outside enjoying the weather. I bet the patio is really great, it just wasn't for us that particular afternoon. The tables were covered in white table cloths and the napkins were cloth as well.Our server filled our glasses with water which we all drank very quickly. They were pretty good about refilling the waters. When I looked at the menu I was quite surprised with how expensive everything was. There was no way I was getting a meal under $10. I didn't want too much to eat, but I wasn't wanting to spend a fortune, either. Again, the diner thing fooled us. I wanted something light so I went for a salad. I got the BBQ Chopped Salad. My boyfriend got the mussels and one of my friends got the meatloaf. Apparently they are famous for their meatloaf, but I had never heard of it before.We were waiting quite a while for our food. They might have been pretty busy but it didn't look too bad. Of course, I couldn't see how many people were out on the patio. When our food finally came we were anxious to eat. My salad was pretty big, and it was good, but there was nothing about it that really stood out. It was sort of plain compared to other BBQ salads I've had (see BJ's or Surly Girl's! - the best!). It was about $12 for my salad. Most other places manage to keep the salads under $10. My boyfriend rather enjoyed his mussels and my friend devoured his meatloaf. This meatloaf looked ridiculous. It was in layers. There was a layer of mashed potatoes, a layer of onion rings and the meatloaf itself. It looked really good. Maybe I'll have to give it a try sometime.They had a pretty extensive menu and there were a lot of choices, I just don't think that I went with the right one. This salad seemed so unexciting compared to what most people got. The service was pretty good, but if you ever feel like checking this place out, maybe dress a bit nicer and prepare to spend a little more money than what you might normally spend at a diner! It really seems like they are going for a sort of casual elegance here.",Stephanie B.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,10/27/13,"Definitely recommend, especially if your gluten free!  Largest gluten free menu that I've ever seen!  Food is very good! Service is quick. Definitely going back.",Lynnette B.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2009/5/8,"Gourmet meatloaf. They even have the billboards all over town to prove it. That should serve as a perfect indicator as to what this Grandview ""diner"" really is all about.The first time I ate here was before I had any idea who Cameron Mitchell was, but once a friend that worked there explained his MO and a few of his other more well known restaurants to, everything here made perfect sense. Basically, this is a yuppy white guy's take on the prototypical neighborhood diner of the good old days- the kind with a neon ""Eat at Joe's"" sign outside and a table full of lazy cops on the inside. It reminded me a lot of a place Bruce Wayne would meet Commissioner Gordon in ""Batman: The Animated Series"" before he mysteriously disappeared in to the night to fight crime. Subtle, this place is not. A willful suspension of disbelief is definitely a prerequisite to enjoying your dinner here.As for the food, the menu is a charming mix of gourmet classics (like that Meatloaf) as well as other Cameron Mitchell twists on American cuisine. Expected favorites like grilled cheese sandwiches, BLTs, and pork chops get modern updates for the Volvo-NPR set, and they sit quite nicely amongst more inventive dishes like the Blackened Tilapia Po' Boy and the Blue Cheese Kobe Burger. With the latter being the exception, most of these dishes are under $10- not bad at all!Once you get in to the ""Famous Large Plates"" section, however, things take a sharp turn in the pricey direction. That meatloaf plate I keep talking about will run you $15.95, and although it comes with some of the best onion rings you'll ever get to taste this side of the Mississippi, I still have a hard time believing anyone would spend almost 16 bucks on a piece of meatloaf. Herein lies the essence of Cap City Diner, and Cameron Mitchell's entire chain of restaurants for that matter- the prices are needlessly dressed up to give you the impression that your dining experience truly is ""upscale"". This is Grandview, after all- you don't need to tack a few extra dollars on to every dish in order to keep out the riff raff. If the food wasn't as good as it is, I'd refuse to eat here on principle. Luckily, there's plenty of great sandwiches that you won't find anywhere else that are sure to keep you coming back whenever you run out of better ideas for dinner. The word ""diner"" might be something of a misnomer, however. Besides the subtle aesthetics and the obvious neon lines on the exterior, Cap City has precious little in common with places like Tee Jaye's or Denny's. That's definitely a good thing, though.",Pete C.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2002/12/8,"Cap City is another one of Cameron Mitchell's creations. Its upscale for a diner, but casual clothes are just fine here. You'll find many comfort foods made with quality ingrediants. There is a mix of diner style booths, contemporary tables, a bar area, and even a handful of barstools facing the kitchen to choose from when you are seated.The signature plate here is the Cap City meatloaf. It is famous around the city and even referred to on the menu's of other restaurants where they claim to have meatloaf, ""cap city style.""The meatloaf is primarily made of veal, pork, beef, and shittake mushrooms. Served open face as a 1 inch thick slice on a slice of bread. On top of that comes a scoop of buttermilk chive mashed potatoes. It is covered with their own homemade bbq sauce. The top is sprinkled with some fried onion straws. Broccoli comes on the side. This is must try item makes Cap City worthy of making a special effort to try. The BBQ sauce is absolutely delicious and my favorite component of the meal. The quality of service here is excellent. The staff here is top notch and quick to resolve any issue you might have. I'm a big fan for good service and I'll give them an extra star for this alone. My only compliant is the size of the desserts. They are enormous and if your not going to share one you will need a to-go box. After a meal, I like a nicely portioned dessert.. Most items on the menu are going to fill you up. Afterwards, there's no slight way to just satisfy your sweet tooth. Desserts here are just too much.Going above and beyond. If you find a menu item you enjoy, their website has a recipe section where you can find out exactly how to make it.TIP : Seek out the Grandview location over the Gahanna location. I think there is more character and diner feel at the Grandview place.",Roland K.,,,,,,

I don't know what the stigma is - or maybe it's just that they never cross my mind. At any rate -Cap City is a ""fine"" diner, meaning its comfort food, but at a premium. While we didn't spend as much as some others have commented on their reviews, it isn't a place to go when you're trying to eat diner food for cheap (that's what the dube is for, people!)We had about a 20 minute wait, but for a saturday night that was understandable. In addition to the excellent rolls (i love bread, i will slay any bread basket in front of me), I had the lobster bisque (very rich, very tasty on a cold night) and the salmon salad. the salmon was cooked well although the portion was small, but the salad itself was very good. I also had the Great Lakes Nosferatu on tap.Our server was extremely friendly and funny, and while she was very busy, her banter gave us a few laughs. When a server is obviously busy, I'm not one to get upset unless it's really a ridiculous situation, so the fact that we had to wait a little bit was no big deal. Overall, it was a good experience. Didn't blow my mind, but I'd go back for the rolls.",Erin R.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,2009/11/8,"Cap City Diner seems to be a bit confused to me.  Not really a diner at all, but with sort of a mod-diner feel and little to no diner food.  Cap City seems to be trying to to dress up basic American semi-classics such as the much-Yelped meatloaf.I cannot be the judge as to whether or not they hit the mark on the meatloaf, as I have not yet gotten over my childhood disdain of the dish and have never tried it.  I always fall for one the sandwiches, pork chops or occasional chicken dish.The front of the restaurant and hostess area looks an awful lot like a diner but that is where the similarities really stop.  As a Cameron Mitchell joint it is not cheap, making the price-point over standard diner fare.  The bar area is nice but the TV's are small, too small to really get any good sports watching done.OH, and the blue-cheese chips.  Yes please.  Love 'em but they cannot be good for you.  The old ""Steve's afternoon delight"" chips at Betty's are the only ones better.",Nathan L.,,,,,,

Their lemonade and raspberry tea were both delicious. I was trying to be health conscious and got a greek salad, which was okay, but I instantly regretted it once I saw everyone else's food come out. My mother in law got the meatloaf... it was great. The mashed potatoes were some of the best I've ever tasted. (they have two types there, butter and chive, and chipotle cheddar, and both are great)As other reviews have said, for the prices, the portions are nothing spectacular, but it's the quality and service you're really paying for. I can tell they make their food fresh everyday and nothing comes from a bag. The service we've gotten both times were wonderful, both servers had personality and paid very special attention to our needs. The second time I went was with my boyfriend on a date. I got the steak this time and it was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. My mashed potatoes were perfect and garlicky and my green beans were hot and crunchy. My boyfriend got the Reuben, and I've never been a fan of reubens but if i had to eat one, it would definitely be from here. The meat was chunky and tender and the sauerkraut was actually sour and crunchy.Their soups there are also pretty amazing. Too bad they only have one soup per day (which I can understand since it is made from scratch everyday), or I would order multiple soups everytime I go! I've only tasted the Buffalo Chicken (which is spicy, I love it!), and the Southwestern Chili (with tender chunks of beef), but I'm looking forward to tasting more of their soups in the future. As for desserts, definitely try their huge chocolate cake sometime- it's enough to feed 4 people, but you can always take some home! The cup o' chocolate was good at first, but as you get deeper into the cup, it gets less chocolatey. All in all, I'm looking forward to future trips. The food is fresh and delicious.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,12/26/07,"The concept here - upscale American greasy spoon food - is not especially interesting or original.  This does not prevent Cap City from being a very good restaurant, and one I really enjoy.  The service is excellent, the food consistently pleasing.  I have found it a great place to enjoy a meal with parents and grandparents, as their uncomplicated menu has something for everyone and delivers value for your dollar.  My favorite entree is probably the Romano-crusted chicken.  The meatloaf is a lot like my mother's: delicious, but not exactly difficult to make.  My grandfather says you can't go wrong with prime rib (which I believe they have every Saturday) and Cap City's made him a happy man.  I got prime rib hash as a blue plate special there one Saturday morning: strips of prime rib, shredded potatoes, and two eggs all fried in a skillet that was upended on my plate.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,8/16/10,"Cap City is a Cameron Mitchell take on American diner fare.  While you can get some of your old favourites, most of the menu features items that would be expected to be found anywhere but a diner.  There is a small area at the front that has been made to look like an old diner with the white tiles and formica tables.To your right, as you step in, is the bar area but it is small.  Don't expect to find a seat here easily on the weekends or game days.  They take reservations but I've never had a problem with getting a table within a few minutes.The fish and chips are always good and no matter what you order, the portions are large.  Salads, and the rest of the food for that matter, are always fresh.  The meat loaf is also a must try dish.  The bread that comes out at the beginning is piping hot and always delicious.  Apart from the main dining area, there is a patio out back that features a bar area and some lounge seats.  This area is perfect in the Spring, Summer or Autumn and there is occasionally live music, depending on the night.  Food is priced well, as are the drinks.  Parking is relatively easy to find as there is a lot out back.  On weekends, parking can be a hassle but I've never had to wait long to get a spot.  Not far from downtown, campus or Grandview, you always get a wide range of people through the door from the young to the old.  Good place to go when the parents are in town to visit OSU.

The meatloaf has been my go to dish because I know what I will be getting, but I was severly disappointed with the salmon BLT, which came to me with soggy bread on top and bottom. The drinks are also quite pricey and the bar service was bad considering there were only 5 or 6 people sitting at the bar.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2005/8/7,"One of Cameron Mitchell's earliest concepts, and still one of my favorites.  Cap City is basically slightly higher-end diner food, but all very well prepared & presented, with a great variety of options.The Maytag Blue Cheese chips are excellent, and the Calamari appetizer (the same/very similar appears at other CM locations around town) is excellent.The classic favorites have already been mentioned - the Meatloaf (and it's cousin, the Meatloaf sandwich) are perennial favorites - though the sauce is different than what some might be used to, and can be a bit off-putting for folks expecting the standard ketchup or brown gravy.   Also see the Romano Crusted Chicken (with angel hair & a good version of vodka sauce).  Daily blue plates are available, and brunch options on Sundays... though I'd steer clear of the beef hash & eggs - it's strips of thinly sliced steak-style beef instead of the standard corned beef, and just comes across as too bland with the potato hash.Atmosphere-wise... well, it's a diner theme, though with a LOT more table seating than bar/counter seating.

It's not that Cap City isn't a nice place. It's really beautifully designed with great lightening and interesting seating. But the addition of diner music and neon signs doesn't figure well into the equation.The food is the saving grace of Cap City. Our table started off with the Maytag Blue Cheese Potato Chips, and while the concept was good I think the Alfredo sauce made the appetizer too heavy. For dinner all I had to do was look at the giant neon sign on the wall the proclaimed ""Cheese Steak"". Their version of the Philly is piled high with shaved prime rib and topped with veggies and white cheddar cheese. This was one helluva sandwich, and this might sound strange but the mushrooms on this Philly were the freshest and best tasting mushrooms I've had in a long time.A friend ordered the Knife and Fork Chili Dog and while they were good he remarked that they were not worth the $7.25 for two dogs. My boyfriend ordered the meatloaf and devoured it in record time.Of course we had to try dessert and whenever I see Crme Brle on a menu I dive for it. ""Topped with fresh berries"" in this case meant strawberries and I was a little disappointed because I really craving some raspberries and blueberries. Somehow in our dining orgy we also ordered the Big Cup O' Chocolate. The warm chocolate lava cake and cold vanilla ice cream does not disappoint. I recommend this.So with all the great reviews on food, why am I giving this place only 3 stars? Service was slow, and I mean really slow. I felt under dressed as well, which adds to my confusion of ""upscale diner"". I just don't think this concept works.",Lisa S.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2008/2/10,"Simple review:The food is delicious and well made.The seating is plentiful and the atmosphere is nice.The bar is large and well stocked.It's Cameron Mitchell, so it feels noisy and busy, but that can be fun.I've been here several times. Meat loaf is wonderful, as are the sandwiches.This is the best place near OSU for family visits. You get a good meal, and everyone has a good time. Recommended.",Sam C.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,2009/7/8,"Brunch 4-5 stars, dinner 3The blue cheese covered chips are amazing.  I don't even like blue cheese and I go there just for them.  They fry the chips just right too.  That's a great way to start a brunch, mix in some nicely done coffee, and follow it up with a wonderful entree (I'm partial to the desert-like French toast), and you're off to a good start on Sunday.  FYI, they don't open until 11am on Sunday (I've shown up early and was rather disappointed).Dinner is hit and miss, alternating between good (but certainly not great) to very good (but never remarkable).  I'd go back,  but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to do so (unless I really want those blue cheese chips).",Shane L.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,2008/6/9,"We were visiting in Columbus so I don't want to be snobbish about this place, but our food and dining experience was just okay. Had the prices been a tad bit lower, I think I would have been more pleased. The one good thing is that the portion sizes were huge so we were able to split an entree. We had the fish and chips ($14.95) and I had high expectations for the beer battered fish fillets. They were good, not excellent, but good. The fish wasn't cod, but it was another white fish (that I can't recall). The batter was okay, but I've had much better and more flavorful beer batter before. The tarter sauce was also okay, but I expected more flair and not something that tasted as mainstream. The blue cheese coleslaw was better than most coleslaws that I've tasted, but I didn't get any of the blue cheese flavor. Most appalling was the 2.50 tea, which is on the high end for regular lipton brews. The fries were also decent, but not fried properly so they were squishy instead of crisp. The fillets were also greasy and oily which I wish they would have been drained properly before serving. The restaurant was very nice to split our entree onto separate plates and we left pretty full but still had room for desert. Coming from the south, I was amused at the dining experience because it seemed so akin to home. The sweet rolls were traditional but I would have preferred them not to be slathered in butter. In short, I've had much better fish and chips for the same price, or even lower. Like I said, the meal wasn't terrible, but it wasn't anything to really write home about. For the entree costing 14.95, I expect more flavor or other interesting components (like better tarter sauce or a flavorful beer batter) to justify a $5.00 (in quality) meal. Personally I would much rather have small portions of something very flavorful instead of greasy large portions of ""okay"" food that one could gorge themselves on.",Miss Rza M.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,1,5/22/14,"My husband and I met a friend for dinner last night and had an absolutely weird and totally uncomfortable experience with our server. Things seemed fined at first we were greeted (I was the last to arrive) and provided waters. Then it came time to order our meal. I attempted to order half of the Two Apple Spinach Salad and our server stopped my order right then and stated that they do not do a half portion of that salad. I said ok and moved on and ordered the rest of my meal without the salad. Then I asked if this was a new policy because I had just had half of that salad last week (it was actually just 4 days prior to this). He stated he had been there for 7 years and they had never done it in all that time. He stated they only do half orders of the entree salads. Was the server trying to bully me into allowing him to pad my bill? I was puzzled and starting to get angry and uncomfortable, it seemed like I was going to have a confrontation with the SERVER! Whaaaat?!!! Anyway the rest of the table ordered their meals. When it came time to remove the menu's the server stood in front of me and just looked at me until I HANDED my menu to him. That was the last straw, now I was definitely angry. We left. I advised the hostesses that we were leaving and we were leaving because our server was so rude. We went next door to The Fish Market and had AMAZING service and food. The lady who served us there was a breath of fresh air after our experience at Cap City.  It was the most bizarre restaurant experience I've ever had. Incredibly embarrassing. I've never had bad service EVER at a Cameron Mitchell restaurant until last night. I've been eating at his restaurants ever since Cameron's opened in Linworth.  I won't be back and I'm spreading the word. Sorry guys but gesh that guy does NOT belong around people.",Joy S.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,12/24/07,"My favorite of the Cameron Mitchell restaurants.  Cap City is a traditional diner with a slightly trendy and upscale twist.  It's a place you can dress up and go to, or just roll up in jeans and a sweater, and not feel out of place either time.  The patio is absolutely fantastic, especially in the spring and fall when the weather in Columbus is conducive to eating outside.The Maytag blue cheese chips are the number one reason I go to Cap City.  I've tried blue cheese chips at other restaurants and they do not even compare to Cap City's.  I think the reason they are the best at Cap City is that they come with alfredo sauce and have just a slight kick of blue cheese without being overwhelming.  The sandwiches and salads on the menu are delicious as well.  Of course, you have to save room for dessert, which are awesome.  In fact, just order one dessert for the table because they are huge!",Melissa H.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2011/6/10,"My fiance and I have gone here quite often in the past 5 years since we discovered it and we always love it. I've never had a bad time there or bad service. There was maybe one time where we had a server who wasn't as talkative as others, but that's it.My fiance always orders the meatloaf, which is wonderful, and I usually order the Balsamic Chicken. One time I ordered the Romano Crusted Chicken, it wasn't terrible but was rather bland and I'll probably never order it again. Also, if you go during the morning/lunch time rather than dinner, the Triple Decker Grilled Cheese is a great choice. As stated by many others, the Blue Cheese Potato Chips are heaven and if you've never tried them, you have to order them!As for drinks I will usually order a strawberry lemonade (the alcoholic one), which is delicious!",Emily T.,,,,,,

This is one of very few restaurants that can pull of both quantity and quality at the same time.  If you want huge portions and great food this is the place to go.  The only negatives are that this place is always packed and for a diner the prices are kind of high but it is a ""Fine Diner"".  If you live in Columbus and haven't been here yet it's worth your time.",Jay E.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,8/15/11,"Cap City is a great staple restaurant to have in your dining out repertoire. I have been to both locations but usually choose this one as it is closer to where I live. The atmosphere is that of an upscale diner which is a nice change of pace and since its Cameron Mitchell you know the food will be great. Over the course of my visits I've tried and tasted many different things. Some of my favorites include the PEI Mussels as an appetizer, and for entrees Six Cheese Ravioli (with meatballs!) and the Smoked Turkey Reuben. I am not a meatloaf person (I know--what a sin!) but from my friends who die for meatloaf Cap City's is hard to beat. Their desserts are huge and great for sharing if you so desire! The bar at Cap City is also nice--try their Pineapple Infused Vodka! I also love eating out on the patio in the summer if the weather permits. Overall Cap City is a great place to have your fill of some fine dining in a relaxed, casual atmosphere!",Liz C.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2003/8/9,"I will always remember this place for many reasons. I embarked on my 3,000 mile journey with my late grandfather in the Fall of 2005 from Boston and after 15 hours of driving we settled in Columbus to stay the night. We had no idea we would end up finding one of the Best diners i have ever eaten in. It was a good sign when i walked in 5 minutes past close and the manager said to come on in. It was first class from the folded cloth napkins to the decor and the plates and silverware. I order to this day one of the best fried chicken dinners with a side of mashed potatoes that i would have again in a heartbeat. Cap City Diner will always be remembered. 93/100",Chuck D.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,4,6/22/10,"I should start off stating that I am a Cameron Mitchell fanatic and this is one of my favorite places in Columbus.  My friends and I frequent the restaurant, mainly due to the amazing dessert options...  The ""diner"" food is fantastic, I definitely suggest getting the meatloaf sandwich for a smaller meal or the meatloaf entree if you are extra hungry.  Recently my friend split a half order of the maytag blue cheese chips (you can get a half order, just ask the server), the meatloaf sandwich, a carafe of sangria, and the piÌ¬ce de rÌ©sistance, the big cup o' chocolate .  In the end we couldn't finish the chocolate since it was too much food for the two of us.  Word to the wise, don't be naive and try to finish the cup by yourself, it is so rich and delicious that you might get stuck.

I tried the Philly cheese steak which was not my favorite but good and also the Romona chicken which was amazing.  The service that we had both times was awesome.  The servers gave us recommendations when deciding between different options.  I was not going to have desert till I saw a cup of chocolate go past, then I just had to have one.  The cup of chocolate is amazing but with two of us eating it we still can't finish it.   I also did not have to wait to be seated .

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,2012/9/8,"It wouldn't be my first pick on the CMR list, but when it's the boss' treat...I went to Cap City today for the first time. I wasn't very impressed with the menu. It's lacking in vegetarian options. So, if you're a veg head, beware - the only plates you can have are the vegetable plate or the omelet (which sometimes has bacon or ham). I actually went with the vegetable plate, a heap of baked spaghetti with a slight bit of marinara sauce, two stalks of broccoli, a pile of spinach with onions, a mix of green beans and carrots, and a spring rolls featuring portabella mushrooms. The spaghetti itself was delicious but left me with unbearably bad breath. If you get it, be sure to pocket some mints on the way out. I'm a fan of semi-crisp steamed veggies, but the broccoli was barely steamed at all, way too crisp for my tastes. The spinach was totally opposite - total mush and not the most pleasant flavor, which is odd because I usually like spinach. The green beans and carrots were very good, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. The spring rolls were the stars of the plate. I could have eaten about fifty of those spring rolls. Oh, and the entire expanse was littered with wonderful soft goat cheese.Before the entrees came, we munched on the hot and sour calamari. One of my coworkers was worried about it being too spicy, but she was happy to find it was much more akin to sweet and sour sauce, not at all hot. The calamari was good. The Maytag chips we had were unremarkable - despite some rave reviews from other people at the table who apparently eat at Cap City all the time. The chips were kettle cooked. The cheese was a bit salty but otherwise pretty tasteless. There was a lot lacking there.The dÌ©cor was okay. It felt very warm, and the huge hanging lights were fun. But other than the entryway and the design of the menus, it definitely didn't feel like a diner - not even like an upscale diner.The service was very good. I noticed the bus staff clearing the empty table of a large group that had been behind us. They didn't let the dirty plates sit on the table at all. They were there as soon as the group walked away. Our waiter had a good sense of humor. The best thing about the meal was the short wait time. Despite the restaurant being packed, we were seated immediately, ordered quickly, and were brought our food in record time. I couldn't believe my eyes when the entrees came out seemingly minutes after placing our orders. And the food was at a great temperature, not scoldingly hot like it had just come straight from the oven onto my tongue.Very wimpy drink menu. I liked the calamari, wasn't blown away by the entrÌ©e, but would go back to try the dessert, which I hear is amazing.",Morgan D.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,5,2004/4/9,"AMAZING FOOD.  Hands down, this restaurant is my favorite place in Columbus.  The food is not your typical diner food.  Their pecan encrusted pork chop and the balsamic chicken are incredible.  We ended up moving out to New England for the past 6 years and took the Cameron Mitchell cookbook with us and used it frequently to get our ""Cap City"" fix.  The recipe for the Buttermilk Mashers and the online recipe for the Maytag Blue Cheese chips helped us survive until we returned to Ohio.  It can be thought to be a bit pricey, but the quality of the food and service demands the price.  They also allow you to order the lunch portions for dinner (which cuts down the price and still gives you plenty of food).  I have ordered most of the things on the menu at one point or another and have NEVER had anything that I was disappointed with.  Cap City Diner ROCKS!",James L.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,10/27/11,"Very cute, upscale, diner themed restaurant. Food was decent, but the descriptions of the food were tastier than the food.

I do miss Cap City the most since moving away. My husband and I used to eat here almost once a week. The Philly Cheesesteak is probably my favorite dish. The sauce is incredible. I have the recipe, but haven't been able to replicate it. I love the melted white cheddar cheese draped over the tender steak and bell peppers. Yum yum! The chocolate cake is also great. They did change their cake though since we moved. I've been absent from Columbus since January 2007. We visited in November 2007 and they had changed their menu. They also changed some of their existing menu items. The cake no longer stands up on the plate. They lie it down on the plate. Also, the icing is not nearly as thick as it used to be. I'm also bummed they took the corn risotto off of their menu. That was one of my favorite side dishes. I still would frequent Cap City if we lived there, but like some of the other reviews: They have switched for less expensive ingredients to make more money. I'm all for making money, but when it affects the taste/quality of the product or food, I disagree.",Ann W.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Columbus,429,4,3,2/25/12,"Let me just say that I was anxiously awaiting the Meatloaf Diner Plate. I could have kept on waiting, I was not impressed. The potatoes were great but the sauce on the meatloaf left me  underwhelmed. The fact that you only get two broccoli spears was also making me feel like $16.95 was way too much, for what I received. The other people I dined with got the Philly Cheese Steak and they enjoyed their meals. I ordered a Peach Palmer and it had a wonderful flavor, it just isn't that sweet. For some that may be okay, but for me and my sister we needed some sugar to sweeten things up. I would order that again. Now another reason I did not give this restaurant more stars was because when I got my glass for that delicious Peach Palmer, I ran my fingers down the outside of the glass and felt the worse case of ""unwashed glass grit"" on its surface. After making sure the very nice waitress felt what I had felt, I asked for and was given a much more seemingly cleaner glass. Service was timely and the staff seemed friendly. Even though we were warned by friends there may be a wait, the wait wasn't as long as we thought it would be. For a diner the place had a nice look to it. For a supposedly upscale diner it was just okay. I can't honestly say I would go back again. I don't mind paying a little more for my meals, but only if the food and the whole experience is included in that price. Sadly, for me, it was not in this case.",Jannet M.,,,,,,

The diner atmosphere is there. I ordered the cod and crispy shrimp. The cod and shrimp were cooked nicely. It was the sauce on it that was disappointing. First some how it was searing hot. Hotter than the fish some how. I could not eat my dish for awhile. When I did the sauce was salty and had a greasy feel and taste. I enjoyed the fact that it came with steamed broccoli but some how a whole shallot was used in the cooking of the broccoli and was too much. My husband ordered the signature meatloaf.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,4,9/19/17,"Atmosphere: The Cap City Fine Diner has three locations and we stopped at the newest in Dublin our way home. It's attached at the bottom of high rises so it's not the stereotypical, big metallic diner, however, the inside is shiney, metallic and everything you could want in a diner.  Service: The waitress was one of the best we've had in a while.  She came to our table, refilled beverages, and was just extremely friendly.  She was in the top 5% of waitresses I've ever had the pleasure of having.  Coffee: The coffee wasn't the greatest.  It wasn't as hot as I hoped and there were grounds in a couple of the refills.  It wasn't terrible but having grounds in the coffee is a turnoff.  Food: There are plenty of menu options at the Cap City Fine Diner.  The menu isn't overwhelming but they have the standard breakfast, lunch and dinner options plus a few unique options.  We ordered the salmon spread to split.  It came with salmon spread (almost like a cream cheese), hard bagel chips, a deviled egg, and pickles.  The salmon spread had huge chunks of salmon which I appreciated.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the app. I decided to order the fish and chips and it was one of the better fish and chips I've had lately.  It wasn't the best, but it was good.  The fish itself was cooked well with a crispy outside.  Personally, I like a lot of crunch without being burnt.  The French fries tasted good, they weren't overly cooked or soggy. Dessert: I went crazy and ordered both a milkshake at the beginning of the meal and my husband and I split the carrot cake.  The milkshake was good.  It was thick and she brought the extra in a mug to continue to refill.  It had banana, caramel and vanilla ice cream.  My husband wanted to try the carrot cake.  Since he ran a marathon, he got to choose.  While carrot cake is not my first pick, I do like it.  This was one of the best carrot cakes I've wver had.  The frosting was tangy and the cake had plenty of actual carrots and raisins cooked in.  It made me a recent carrot cake convert! Would I come Back:I enjoyed the Cap City Diner.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,3,2011/5/17,"When I lived in Columbus I would go to the original cap city and just loved it. I was so excited to hear that they put a location in Dublin, which is close to my parents home. We came on a Friday night with reservations. I strongly recommend that you make reservations ahead because it was very busy. There is a parking garage right across the street and also street parking. The initial lobby when you walk in is tiny and uncomfortably crowded. We were seated quickly but unfortunately were seated in the closed in patio. It was cold. We had to ask the server several times to turn off the fan. My mother had to put on her coat. It was also incredibly loud. It was impossible to have a conversation without shouting. The service was prompt and friendly. The dinner came out within a good period of time and our drinks were refilled quickly. The food was overall disappointing. The pork chops were good. The meatloaf was about as I remember it- good but only if you really like meatloaf. My dad got the walleye special and it was bland and dry. Would definitely not get that again, and it was the most expensive thing that we got. I got the carrot cake for dessert and that was totally outstanding! I think that I you want to come for overpriced diner food in a trendy/ loud restaurant then this is a good bet. There are many more intimate restaurants in the area that I will go to instead. If it is cold ask to sit inside because the closed in patio was not comfortable.",Sarah S.,,,,,,

Turned out to be a good idea. The place kept me awake as it was quite busy (good) and had fun music playing throughout. We were promptly seated in a nice booth and the service was pretty good overall. For appetizers, we got the wings --- they are sweet, not spicy --- but very good and the portion size was large. We also shared their meatloaf, which was sufficient as a meal, unless you're really hungry.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,5,9/14/17,"Service was awesome.  Food was very good and reasonably priced for what I got.  I had the Romano Chicken, two thin sliced and lightly breaded chicken breasts with a delicious red sauce.Will definitely be back when in town again.",Josh D.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,3,7/26/17,"Have only been to one of the other CC's once so was thrilled to find this one closer to home.  Be warned that it is right off a very busy street and parking can get dodgy.  There is on the street parking but that goes quickly but there is a garage behind it.While in the spirit of things it has the accoutrements of a diner it is, you could say, upscale diner as in no older than old grease or stains on the counters and while there are diner specials (seriously, the meatloaf was flying out of there) there are also not so typical diner foods like smoked salmon spread and pecan crusted pork chops. Plus there is this big bar in the front with happy hour going on.It is a beautiful place but the mood was dampened by the wait and buss staff hanging out in a space right behind our booth and yucking it up while they waited to do their jobs.  There was about 6 of them standing there to the point that some of the ""overflow"" was standing practically next to us.  Told our server this was not cool and they moved.  Managers and hosts came and apologized.Even though it's not classic diner food I had the salmon and that was pretty darn tasty and hubs liked his chicken.  The rolls on the other hand were so dry I let them be.  Was bummed that they ran out of the pie I wanted but my root beer float substitute was great; that red and white striped paper straw was a nice touch.  Prices are reasonable and will have to return when it's a daily special I'd like.",Teri D.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,5,7/20/17,"This new Cap City is fabulous!  We have have been in five times since they opened.  We have tried their lunch, dinner, happy hour and carry out.  There is a majorly professional crew running the place!  We feel like VIPs every time we visit.  The food is spectacular.  Amazing salads, blue plate specials, salmon, veggie plate, gourmet and simple kid's meals.  We tried out the Tuesday ""beer and burger.""  That's any burger on the menu, and a beer for $10!  They even custom made a portobello burger for me.  We have had many special requests while dining here.  All of them were met with a ""can-do"" and eager willingness to please their guests.  Chris, Eric, Lindsay and Amanda are all top notch.Very elegantly designed and decorated retro diner.

We got the BBQ chicken salad, balsamic chicken veggie platter, fish and chips and the salmon salad.  Each of us enjoyed our meals, the servings are large and there were a couple of doggie bags!!  Mondays are Margerita Mondays so 2 of us ordered margeritas... very nicely done.  I love the restaurants that Cameron Mitchel owns.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous. Last time I checked GPS will take you to the back of this restaurant. It is in a new development and you will want to turn on the side street just up from the restaurant. That will take you to a parking garage that is free.",Liz C.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,2,2001/4/18,"Our waitress was great and the restaurant has a cool vibe but my meal was horrible .  I ordered the meatloaf meal and there wasn't much taste to  the meat. The mashed potatoes were cold and a piece of the broccoli was  partially frozen.  I have had this same dish at the other Cap City and it was amazing, unfortunately the Dublin location isn't up to par. My friend ordered a salmon appetizer, took two bites and couldn't finish it. The waitress noticed that she didn't eat it and without asking removed the charge from the bill because she said many people didn't like the appetizer.",N K.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,3,2009/3/17,Had the meatloaf and it was ok. Not great and not worth the wait to get a table. The mashed potatoes were fine. Gravy was ok. Crispy onions were good. Overall not that impressed.,Sara S.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,1,8/19/17,"Was very disappointed with my experience in Dublin.  we all felt all staff members needed more training and manager was not helpful. Sat with a table of 3 near the bar - service was very slow. Our waiter was nice but seemed totally unsure of any questions we asked him . MY SALMON SALAD WAS A JOKE SALMON WAS TINY ( child sized) portion. Also we had a leaking pipe over our heads.  I ended up with my hair and dress wet - we asked for the manager -when he finally arrived -he said  it  was from the humidity and maybe I needed an umbrella -we all felt he was condescending  with that comment. I was Very disappointed and think the Grandview location is far better than this. Will never go backone.",Linda S.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,5,2008/7/17,Had brunch here on Saturday and it was so good I came running back after church on Sunday. No wait either day. Food and service exceeded my expectations. Love that the iced tea comes out fresh in a carafe. The meatloaf sandwich is their claim to fame but I think their French Toast is even better. So many interesting things on the menu that I can't wait to try!! Patio is beautiful and I did not find any street noises to be a distraction.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,3,8/27/17,"We finally checked out Cap City @ Bridge Park this past Friday. And while the food was good the service was disappointingly below that. A group of 7 of us went around 8pm. 2 of us ordered appetizers, 1 a salad and the blue cheese potato chips for the table. Salad came out first then about 5 min later the chips. While the chips were delish we were slightly surprised by what seemed like straight out of the Kettle's bag kettle chips. We were expecting homemade potato chips. For the entrees we ordered roasted chicken greek salad, romano crusted chicken, ponzu glazed salmon, thanksgiving day sandwich and 2 of the walleye special.  1 walleye came out then 12min later 4 more entrees and another 5min later the last 2 entrees. By the time we all had our food the first walleye that came out was cold. No complaints on the taste of the food (pretty average) or the service itself (very friendly staff) but just bad/long/poorly timed service. Overall the atmosphere was lively & we loved the music that was playing. Since we were in no rush & enjoying each others company we still had a great time despite the poor timing on delivery.",Crystal D.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,4,12/28/17,"So, aside from having perhaps the best meatloaf in town, and definitely the best slice of apple pie, this is just a darn good spot. Just as good as the original and a little cooler with the new decor. I feel confident that no matter what I order at this place it will always be a good meal. The staff is always attentive and competent or better. I'm not a fan of the parking, that just seems to be life in Columbus nowadays. Other than that, I can't think of a single negative thing to say about this place; fantastic.",Nick F.,,,,,,

Only after asking the manager for help did we finally get seated. But then we sat at a table with a leaky a/c vent overhead. It was like eating in a rainforest. Asked the manager for help once again and was told they are aware of the problem and it will be corrected - thanks for nothing. As a positive four of us ordered dinner salads and we all enjoyed them. Two salads, a glass of beer and a glass of wine - $46 before tip.",Bill W.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,3,2010/9/17,We love Cap City in Gahanna and on Olentangy - we were excited to try the new one close to our home in Dublin.  Great location - friendly staff nice seating BUT what happen to my favorite dish?   Meatloaf.  It looks - feels and taste like they added filler to the hamburger!   I didn't even eat 1/2. And no I didn't take the left over home.  Sad! Hope they make the meatloaf like the other locations.,Barb C.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,5,2012/9/17,"Best in Dublin, IMO. Been here four times. Every dish is solid and done well. When your reuben comes crisp - and not soggy, with the right amount of kraut, a schmear of russian, and a heap of moist corned beef minus the gristle... you know it's a keeper. The crew is friendly and mingle up the crowd. It's nice. They're always looking to engage. I can't figure out when to go as they're jammed, not jammed, jammed... with no pattern I can figure. Basically, when I see no line, I divert in. This place aint cheap, but they respect the eater with an appropriate heap of food. We've hit most of the menu at this point and haven't come across any misses. It's like the diners back on the Island or in Jersey - but classier.",Dan S.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,4,2010/8/17,"I went to Cap City in Dublin on a Saturday at around 4:45(I had to set a reservation and that was the only time slot due to homecoming). I can't say enough about having a great waiter to make a dinner experience good.  Our waiter there was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed and than some.  We had the meatloaf and it was good. My daughter had the ribeye and it was more fat than meat(I know ribeye is more fatty but she got two small bites of meat and it cost almost 30.00). That wasn't worth the money.  The dessert was fabulous and made up for the ribeye. Apple pie, brownie sundae, and the big chocolate cake were ordered and they didn't disappoint!! I am rating it four stars because of the over priced ribeye, otherwise everything was good.It can be pricey but it would be nice to go to for a birthday dinner etc...",Danielle B.,,,,,,

I had the Romano Chicken (always a favorite) and my sister had the Vegi Plate (hope you like peppers if you order this).  I love Cap City, but am always disappointed when a vegetarian companion has such limited options.",Kim B.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,5,11/25/17,Had a great experience here. We made reservations through Open Table but when we arrived our table wasn't ready. (The wait was 45 minutes on a Friday night.) The staff informed us the patio had a table available and confirmed it was enclosed and heated so we went with it. After being seated the staff provided us with two glasses of champagne for our inconvenience which was a huge surprise and just demonstrated the quality of service there. We got the pretzels for an appetizer-- they were okay but not the best. I ordered the meatloaf which was delicious and huge. I was able to take home half. My fiancÌ© got the meatloaf sandwich and liked it too. We got the carrot cake for dessert and loved it! So amazing! Very sweet and decadent like I never knew carrot cake could be! I'd highly recommend Cap City Dublin-just make reservations.,Amanda B.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,3,9/17/17,"Went a few weeks ago with some family. Place was a zoo. Great deal with the half off wine Wednesday. Server was very nice, although I think he was extremely overwhelmed with his section. He struggled to open the wine bottle, and we really didn't see him much after that. Shame, because my mother's food came out wrong and it took 30 minutes to find someone to fix it. Food was pretty good. Took awhile to get our bill and he sent another server to drop off our card and apologize for his absence. Was a little odd. Overall, food was good and service was mediocre.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,3,2008/2/17,"So we wanted to take my mom out, for just being her awesome self, and we thoight we would check out cap city. The grandview one is awesome and this is closer. Plus i am a fan of Camron Mitchell food in general.    There was a wait which was expected and they quoted us at 30-50 min which is cool....an hr and 15 min later we get our table which is still fine. The server was friendly enough but clearly was super confused and overwhelmed....he had no clue and couldnt answer questions....about anything....it was super awkward to watch him struggle and almost cut off his thumb opening a bottle of wine w his wine key....the struggle is real....but bro you need your thumb... I almost asked to show him. Well food came eventually from a runner and all was well until they bought my mother the wrong food out first minus ours......then never came back. Finally ours comes but before we can ask them to fix the runner runs off. Food was terrific but then not a single person came back for 30 min...so then when i ask for dessert menu to try to push the fates i took that time to ask for her food to be fixed.So then me and my sis polished off the bottle of wine we were gonna save waiting for our server to come back and let us order a delicous slice of choc cake....never happened bc by the time he came back we were over it. It was 9:00 we had been there since 6:30!!...so to his apology he finally brought our checks. Oh and dont worry those didnt come out right away either. Again 22 min later bc i timed it he came back and dropped our checks off....we felt like we were being kidnapped....then after he took our checks he had another server drop them off and tell us he would be by to say goodbye. Oooooook yeah thanks but no thanks, he didnt anyway. So all in all on a positvie note he brought us bread twice....but thanks but no thanks service was terrible and food wasnt even worth how awful the service was.",Courtney W.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,5,8/24/17,"I'm very happy with the new Cap City in Dublin.  There was plenty of parking in the new Longstreet Garage across the street from the Diner.  Our server, Samantha was wonderful! She knew the menu and kept our drinks full.  I had the Romano Crusted Chicken.  It was very flavorful and the portion size was perfect.  One of our group raved over the Pecan Crusted Pork Chops, huge chops! That may be my next meal at Cap City.  The Seasonal Vegetable Plate and the Southern Fried Chicken at our table also looked great!   We ogled the meatloaf at the next table over as it was delivered and demolished by the happy couple. The four of us sat on the busy large patio that faces west.  They had sun screens that let in plenty of light yet blocked the sun sufficiently.  The ambiance was great and you could easily hold a conversation without raising your voice even being next to busy Riverside Drive.  I'll be back for sure!",Tina T.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,3,8/19/17,"This was an uneven experience- bar service was good, got seated promptly close to our reservation time. The premeal bread was tasteless, very disappointing. I'm not sure why this is hard for anybody . I got the short rib special and it was very good. My partners harvest salad  faired poorly to Wendy's. Actually that's an insult to Wendy's . The turkey would disappoint a high school cafeteria and ended up being comped due to its appearance as a grey gelatinous blob. My meal was worth going back for- but I'll give them time to work out the flaws first for the rest. A firmer hand in the kitchen could solve the ills.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,5,8/13/17,"A few bumps in the service but overall I am very happy with the Dublin Cap City. Sweet and sour calamari was cooked perfectly and delicious. Definitely enough for three of us to share as an appetizer. I had the Greek salad with chicken, dressing on the side. The vegetables were perfectly crisp and the chicken was nicely seasoned, sliced, and served warm on the side - which probably helped the lettuce stay crisp. Genius. Iced tea was freshly brewed and served with plenty of ice. The absolute best thing was the banana bread pudding. I loved it. The bananas were amazing with a thin carmelized coating on one side. The bread pudding was both creamy and substantial. The best texture I've ever had in bread pudding. They must have used magic bread. Truly amazing. Atmosphere was stylish and eclectic. It was a fun place to take my teenage boys and would be even more fun for a grown up date night. We didn't get the promised rolls but didn't remind the server because we were saving room for dessert. There was a little mix up with the dessert order but it was handled perfectly by the wait staff and I left very happy. Tips: I found street parking on Riverside but the entrance on that side is a back door so we had to walk all through the restaurant to find the host stand. The giant gumball machine didn't work right. It took our quarter but no gumball came out. Luckily the host had a container of gumballs and gave us one. So no loss. I'll be back for sure.",Lisa L.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Dublin,43,4,3,2008/2/17,"I've been a big fan of the Grandview Cap City for years and was excited to try this location for the first time since it's close to home. Have to say I was disappointed. Perhaps it was because we stopped in after 9:00 on a Saturday, but our waitress disappeared for long stretches (she did inform us she was taking some extra tables on the patio), the potato soup was watery and lukewarm, as was my meatloaf. On the plus side my wife enjoyed her salad, the portion sizes were good, the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was nice and clean (which I would hope for being less than a month old).  The hostess asked us how our dinner was but seemed uninterested in why when we told her we were disappointed. Based on our overall positive experiences with Mitchell restaurants I'm sure we'll try again and hope for a better result.",Chuck V.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,10/26/17,"This is one of those super cool places that you go to when the kids are away.

My wife always gets the meatloaf and that's great too. 4.5 stars for sure. Now, what I'm about to tell you all is a bit of a secret between a friend and I. Beer and chocolate cake go great together so I went with a brown ale and a piece of their chocolate cake and holy cow it was better than dinner I think. Cake slice is massive and very very good. Definitely enough for 2 if not more. I have previously had the calamari and it is bad to the bone!

I'm so glad I settled here. The atmosphere is fun, a little more classy than average but still welcoming. I was happy to bring my family to a place that had a menu we could all enjoy.

I know and trust it's exactly the same every time I go. The salad dressing is like no other, very unique and delicious, tangy and sweet! The Romano crusted chicken is the perfect portion of crispy chicken pieces and perfectly dressed pasta so it doesn't stick together. It's also perfectly cooked, never mushy. It's a must have. Lastly the chocolate cake is TO DIE FOR. Three large layers and the perfect ratio of frosting to moist cake. I love this restaurant!",Blaire W.,,,,,,

They serve the home style food but with a city flair.  Their portion sizes are diner sized(hearty) and the quality of the food meets city-like standards.  I had the fish sandwich the flavors were good, the fish big and flakey and the fry on the fish was just right.

Context is hard here: it's a diner, but an upscale one (and Cameron Mitchell owned), so how do you judge?First the food...very good. The meatloaf, as noted in other reviews, is hard to beat. Everything about it is great: flavor, portion, composition. We also tried the Romano crusted chicken, which was tasty. The creamy tomato sauce it came with had a lot of flavor.The service is what was lacking. First off I my silverware had food crusted on it. Not a great way to start the meal. The server apologized but didn't really seem fazed by it. She was busy with a lot of other tables and we didn't see a whole lot of her. If comfort food is your craving this is a perfect choice.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,2005/4/17,"This place was amazing!  The general manager for our local location mentioned he had made reservations for dinner at a place that we may consider out of the ordinary.  He mentioned it was a diner, but so much more.  So perhaps a bit wary, we made our way to Cap City which is tucked into a strip mall in a suburb of Columbus.Perusing the menu, I saw quite a few of what you would consider ""diner standards"".  Pork chops, meatloaf, fish & chips...they even have a nightly blue plate special!  So I mainly heard rave reviews of the meatloaf, but I decided to break the mold a bit and went with the pecan crusted pork chop.  I've been on a pork kick lately...so I figured what the heck.  Dinner started with warm, yeasty rolls that reminded me of what is served at O'Charley's...which is actually a good thing...they're some of my favorites.  Oh my goodness...one of the best pork chops I have ever had.  Two huge perfectly cooked chops crusted in candied pecans and drizzled in a bit of apple cider glaze.  They were perfectly complemented by some amazing chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes and lightly sauteed spinach.  This was so much more than greasy diner food...not that there is anything wrong with that, it has it's place.  But this place was delicious and I'm glad the general manager overlooked our dubious expressions when he mentioned where we were eating.

Honestly, I've never had a bad meal and I continue to bring out-of-towners here to showcase food in Columbus. Vegetarian options are few, but usually very well done, so a great spot for a larger gathering which includes people with dietary restrictions. Service is always excellent; attentive without being pushy. First time? Go with the pork chop, the meatloaf or even the vegetable plate. Yum!",Anna S.,,,,,,

I also like the balsamic chicken (gluten-free). My husband swears by the pecan crusted pork chops, and also likes the fish and chips. My husband recommended the pork chops to a visiting friend and he said they were incredible.I love that they bring me gluten-free bread when they bring my husband his regular bread. The best thing about Cap City is I can order off the gluten-friendly menu and not worry about getting sick.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,9/14/17,I have had many things on the menu and they have all be great. They have a wide assortment of food from sandwiches to pasta to hearty dinners.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,2007/10/16,Cap City is one of those places where you go to get a great experience every time.. I recently went and our reservation was about 30 minutes or so off from when myself and friends had called for.. And they completely made up for it by offering us each a complimentary drink or dessert and of course we each chose dessert;) the porkchops and salmon salad and wings are all my go-to's but every time I try something new I am still impressed.. Cameron Mitchell fine dining but at a great price! My favorite dessert is the key lime pie but the carrot cake is equally amazing:),Stephanie K.,,,,,,

Reservations made months in advance.  Food was outstanding, but the way they handled us not liking our original table was genuine outstanding service. That seems to be a theme at Cameron Mitchell establishments.  Jeremy one of the managers sent one of their staff members to Kroger for Hot Chocolate after he heard my daughter order it and the server tell her they did not have it in summer months.  Nicely done Cap City!  See you next Mother's Day if not before.",Matt N.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,3,2006/8/16,"Fiancee and I decided to head to Cap City tonight for dinner.  Food was good, service was meh...let's go deeper!We arrived a little after 6:30 PM.  Didn't have to wait for a table, which is always nice!Seated by the host (didn't catch his name, but he was extremely nice); he advised that our waitress Candie would be with us shortly.We were seated a bit too long for my taste before Candie visited us.  When she did, she took our drink orders (Diet Pepsi for me, Sangria for my date).  Drinks came out quickly.  At this point, we also put in an order for calamari (everyone reading should know this by now!) along with our dinner orders; Ponzu Salmon for me and Fish & Chips for my lovely bride to be.After this, we didn't see our waitress for 20-30 minutes.  The host brought our calamari to the table (which was delicious, still not as good as Ocean Club's, but that's a tough dish to beat).  We munched on that for a bit, along with the awesome rolls that Cap City provides.  Probably 7-10 minutes after the calamari came out, the same host (again, I wish I knew his name, he was great) brought out our dinners.  Salmon came with a generous portion of rice along with some stir fried veggies (peas, mushrooms and peppers I believe) along with a ponzu glaze; date's fish and chips was a HUGE portion ( I think four pieces of fish) with fries, slaw, and dipping sauce.I finished my entire meal without receiving a refill on my drink; I finally received one about five minutes after I was finished.  This kinda stinks because I tried to position my empty glass to be as visible as possible, but this was to no avail.  By the time I received my refill I was already somewhat irritated about it.  My salmon was great, veggies were crisp, and rice was tasty...couldn't even finish it because I got so full.  My date (as is the norm) ate one piece of fish along with fries before she was done.  She really enjoyed the food, she just becomes full way too fast!We sat at our table for at least ten minutes after we were finished before we were approached by Candie to ask if we wanted dessert.  We declined as we were too full, but I witnessed several AWESOME looking dishes going out that somewhat make me sad that I didn't order anything (Strawberry Shortcake, Chocolate Cake especially).  When the check was delivered, I immediately had my card placed with it; Candie serviced nearby tables without grabbing it for about 10 more minutes.  She eventually came and retrieved it and we paid up.  Unfortunately, due to the timeliness of this (along with her not showing up at all throughout our meal despite seeing nearby patrons being visited quite a bit by their waiters) I ended up taking five dollars off the tip.It's a shame; we love Cap City, and the food was great, but tonight the service left more to be desired.  I hope this is just a fluke, because we love the menu there!Give it a shot!  As I said, the food is great!  Hopefully you receive a little bit better service then we did, but we still will be back.",Zack S.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,3,2/19/17,"My husband and I went to Cap City for dinner a few days ago, and it was an ok experience. Essentially, I found the whole visit neither underwhelming nor particularly stellar. We were seated pretty quickly, and the service was good. I always appreciate free bread, but I felt like this bread was a bit on the dry side and could have used a little assistance (perhaps a butter or jam). I had the fried chicken dinner, and there were a couple things I really enjoyed about it. The mashed potatoes were great, and the crunch on the fried chicken was delightful. I'm always concerned that people will overcook boneless chicken to the extreme, but that wasn't an issue here. My only complaint with the chicken i that most of the flavor seemed to reside in the breading rather than penetrating down into the meat. The meal also came with green beans, but I didn't particularly care for their sweetness (this doesn't mean they were poorly prepared, but rather that they just weren't a hit for me). One cool thing about their food is that they have great portion sizes, so I was able to have a sandwich made with a leftover piece of chicken for lunch the next day. All in all, I'm not sure that I'll be returning for dinner, but I will perhaps visit to check out the brunch options.",Jacinta Y.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,12/14/16,"The only annoying part of our meal was at the outset. We'd taken care to make reservations, but it didn't seem to make much of a difference and we had a long wait for our table while it seemed that seating went strictly as first-come, first-serve, reservation be damned. That was extremely annoying and, as the place was VERY busy with limited waiting area, it was a difficult wait for a woman with a cane and arthritis. The restaurant has a faux-50's diner decor with a large open kitchen. As I said, it was extremely busy and so it was both loud and the food smells from the kitchen are very prominent, so expect to walk out with it all over your clothes and in your hair. The booths are large and comfortable and the service was good. Our waiter was friendly and diligent, going so far as to make up to-go cups for me and my husband. The portions sizes were VERY generous and the food was AMAZING. I had the pecan crusted pork chops. The chops were enormous, cooked perfectly (bone in) all the way through, juicy and the pecan crust and apple cider glaze complimented the meat perfectly. The house made drinks were excellent; we had all three, the strawberry-basil lemonade (a little heavy on the basil over the strawberry, but grassy and fresh), the peach palmer (lemonade, iced tea and peach puree that was just sweet enough without being cloying or sour) and the passionfruit fresca (which is a little sweet for some but was delicious and sparkly). The drinks come in carafes from which you can pour your own refills; a generous size for the price and taste! We didn't have room for appetizers or dessert, but looking at them on other tables, they're definitely a group activity; they were much too large for a single person to go it alone. I'd definitely go again--hopefully at a time it was less busy.",Erin B.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,2006/11/17,Came here on a suggestion from a friend before seeing a show at the Newport. Food was great! The chips with bleu cheese appetizer was delicious. The burger ranks as one of the top 5 I've ever had. The Reuben was good but needed extra dressing. It's more of a roast instead of shaved or sliced. Atmosphere is busy but we were seated very quickly and service was fast and very friendly. Convenient that this eatery is so close to high street so we could eat and make it to the Newport easily.,Jessica G.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,3,5/23/16,So they say they are known for their meatloaf. Maybe I don't know meatloaf but this was not their best. Ours came out in about 2 min and was just ok. A very solid block of meat with some ok bread underneath. Dinner rolls were also kind of dry and not fresh. They did make up for it with their walleye and pork chops. Both were great followed by a very good desert. Would love to give 4 stars but the oversight on the meatloaf seems unforgivable.,Matthew H.,,,,,,

I got the fried chicken and my wife had the fish sandwich both of them were tasty. We had to top it off with a strawberry short cake i have to say this is one of the best short cakes ive had.

They did this once before and it was terrible and I did not return to the restaurant until they changed back to the original Balsamic chicken which was an  airline breast , this was always  Juicy tender and wonderful and I love that dish. The three medallions are always small dry tough no flavor and nasty. They also got rid of the muscles which for a diner they always made wonderfully and it happy hour it was the best appetizer ever.

We were brought dinner rolls that were dry and there was no butter brought out with them.  2 people at our table ordered the Meat Loaf, one ordered Chicken Romano and I ordered Fish & Chips.  We all pretty much had the same comment about our meals....common.  Our meals had no ""KA-POW"" to them.  My fish was not crispy battered.  It was limp like it was in a styrofoam container for a while.  The fries were just warm and blah.  The jalapeno cole slaw was pretty good.

We had to ask twice today before the server would bring any.But the food was all good and we were enjoying the meal until we all ran dry of drinks. How hard is it bring a glass of soda? The server then brought drinks after we had finished eating. Finally we bought three overpriced deserts and the banana bread pudding came in a bowl less than half emptyI guess that was not the servers fault but it just left a bad taste which is not why I spent 100+ for Sunday brunchThis CapCity should not be confused with the one in Grandview  It had always been good.",Bill L.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,3,2001/6/17,"I have always been a avid Cap City Diner fan.  Today for lunch my wife had her usual Meat Loaf dinner.  I tried something new to me, the Shrimp Banh Mi Wrap.  This is where the the lunch went south.  Our dinners set under the warming lamps for 13 minutes.  I had to go to the gentlemen at the front counter to inform him of this situation.  No one had picked up any food for over 15 minutes until this gentlemen brought us our dinners.  Then there was a flurry of servers picking up food.  My wife's dinner was luke warm.  Mine was the same, but I ate mine.  The server came by after one bite of the Meat Loaf and returned it to the kitchen.  She returned in a few minutes with a hot dinner.  My wife's dinner was what we come to expect.  I ordered a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream for desert.  Thinking that our server was totalling our bill.  We waited about 10 minutes for our server to return, only to ask if we wanted anything else.  She immediately tallied our bill and we paid and we were done.  Taste of the food was great.  Temperature of food and service, not so hot!",Don T.,,,,,,

Spent 100.00 on dinner for family of five and was very disappointed and wish we went somewhere else.  Froze in our booth from the door opening and closing (poor design) which was perpetuated by very slow service.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,5,2009/4/16,"After some of the worst service at an Easton restaurant, the staff and manager at Cap City turned a disappointing anniversary diner into an evening we will not forget. We called after walking out of another restaurant and Cap City told us they would be waiting with a secluded booth. They greeted us with flowers and a champagne toast at our table. Our waiter, Magic (sp?) was thoughtful and gave us all the time we needed to turn the evening around. Our food, blue cheese chips, a chicken Milanese Caesar salad and the pork chops were outstanding. The manager came over to wish us a happy anniversary and make sure everything was great! That is an understatement. We cannot be more thankful to the caring staff at Cap City for their delicious food and their commitment to making our night meaningful.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,3,9/28/17,"Disappointing birthday experience. My husband and I, along with our 2 children went here last night to celebrate my birthday (which was yesterday Sept 27th).  My husband made a reservation and noted it was my birthday.  When we arrived, we were greeted by the hostess who wished me a Happy Birthday and was very friendly.  I would have assumed the birthday message was relayed to our waitress, but we came to find out that it was not.  Our waitress was not very friendly.  She never acknowledged my birthday or anything.  The food was pretty good, as we do love coming to Cap City for milestone celebrations.  The waitress asked us at the end if we'd like dessert, and I asked for the Carrot Cake (which is AMAZING!).  When she walked away... I said to my husband, I bet it won't come out with a candle. He said that he was sure it would because he had noted it in the reservation.  Well... she walked out with no candle in the cake.  When she placed it on the table, my husband nicely asked if she could please bring a candle.  She took the cake back, and returned a minute later with a candle.  She never said Happy Birthday or anything.  When we received our bill, the cake was on there!!  We did ask if birthday celebrations are still acknowledged with a complimentary piece of cake.  She did end up taking it off... it was just a disappointing experience, and not what we've come to expect from Cap City.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,3,10/18/15,"Cap City Diner in Grandview is one of my favorite Cameron Mitchell restaurants. As the Cap City Diner in Gahanna has pretty much the same menu, you would think that I'd like it just as much. That unfortunately was not the case.First, the building is sorely lacking in natural light and makes the interior look drab. Second, they have less than half the draft beer selection of the Cap City in Grandview. Third, their buttered rolls tasted a little stale compared to the fresh out of the oven fresh that seems to be the standard at Cap City in Grandview.But the dinner entree were still just as plentiful and yummy. We had their pecan crusted porkchop and the southern fried chicken-- both just as good as the version served in Grandview. So if you live on the east side of Columbus, this location is likely still a good dinner option. If you live anywhere else in Columbus however, go to the Cap City in Grandview.

This local chain began more than 20 years ago.This location is situated in a large strip mall shopping center.   Although plenty of parking around, the location is quite busy, especially on weekends.   I do recommend making reservations on weekends to minimize long waits.  I'd describe the interior as a contemporary looking diner with silver plated doors and red vinyl seating.   It was pretty noisy inside with all the sounds of families celebrating special occasions and a hustling kitchen staff.   Same great menu selections as available at her sister location in Grandview.

My appetizer was also accompanied by a wedge salad which was very tasty with the right amount of toppings.For dinner, I had the short rub which was a blue plate special. Great flavor and you could basically eat this with just a fork, it was THAT tender. The side was carrots and parsnips which is not terribly common. The carrots were as expected and the parsnips were very crisp and light with a sweet flavor. They paired well with the short ribs which are richer and heavier.The better half had the New York Strip which was so so. The flavor was decent but could have used more salt. The vegetables were enjoyable, crisp and decent flavor, nothing over the moon. All in all it was an $80+ dinner, and we walked away asking how. Would I recommend it? Well, I'm fifty fifty I guess. It was good, just seemed a bit overpriced for what we got.",Lisa R.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,5,12/26/16,Just dined here tonight with my hubby and 2 kids. A little slower to bring out our entrees but did get regular check ins about the status from the manager. We received 40% off our final bill for the wait and the creme de la creme was the manager waiting at the door with 4 pieces of chocolate cake. Great service great food and fab for families!!,Grace M.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,2004/10/16,"We've only ever been for brunch, and it's terrific... from the complimentary basket of glazed rolls, to the bagel and lox plate or the breakfast burrito. The teenager ordered the stuffed French toast, and it looked incredibly decadent. The Eggs Benedict is perfect with one (or two!) of their delicious mimosas... although they no longer use or serve freshly squeezed orange juice. I do wish it opened a little earlier than 11am on the weekend, but I can usually hold out to make it to Cap City Diner.",Corin C.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,7/23/12,"We planned on going here last tuesday and had a reservation for 6pm.While we were on our way, we got a call due to a kitchen fire they were going to be closed that evening.I was dissapointed and expected something to make up for the trouble they offered but nothing other than an apology.Saturday we were in the area again and made a reservation for lunch.It was my husbands birthday and the manager came to apologize about last time and invited us to dessert.Good start, I had asked for a nice table but we were seated right at the kitchen which made it unavoidable to watch and wait for our food being made.We sat right at the screen with the orders which was annoying to watch and hear the time pass and see our order ready under the heatlamps, and moved by 3 different servers, plate wiped, put back again and so on.Sometimes I don't want to know what all is going on before I get my plate or how long it is actually sitting there before it is brought out.About 45 minutes later the food came, romano crusted chicken and breakfast burrito for the birthday boy and the BBQ chicken salad with salmon instead for me.All of it tasted great, was warm, no complaints other than a different table next time.I'm actually pretty glad tuesday dinner got cancelled since saturday and sundays you get the fabulous cinnamon rolls instead of regular rolls, they are probably my favorite thing about Cap City Diner.For dessert we got the chocolate cake, the carrot cake and the peanut butter pie.I don't agree with the other raving reviews of the chocolate cake, sure it is a huge slice but tastewise it is your usual rich devils food cake with chocolate frosting that you can just as well make at home.The carrot cake a bit too ""healthy"" too many carrots, pineapple, too moist almost raw tasting.Now the peanut butter pie is where its at!Now you won't get a whopping slice like with the first two but the taste will blow you away!Real oreo crust, not the premade grocery one, smooth and silky super peanut buttery, chocolate, whipped cream and peanuts on top.Yup, this was the winner of the day!",Nijole T.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,5,10/20/15,I always get the meatloaf and my husband says their liver n onions is the best he's ever had!  You MUST order an appetizer and it has to be the Blue Maytag chips!  To die for!!  Never have a bad experience here!,Amanda W.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,5,12/15/13,"Cap City is great!  Service is friendly and attentive, and the manager stopped by to see how we were doing.  The decor and menu reflect the fine diner atmosphere very well, with a retro look to the place and a menu that includes blue plate specials and diner favorites.My husband had the Fried Chicken, which is his favorite dish at both locations.  Portion size is generous, and the chicken is moist and juicy with a nice crust.  He especially likes the addition of nuts to the green beans.  Mashed potatoes and gravy round out the meal.The gluten free menu here has more options than at the other location, and they also offer gluten free rolls - including with the delicious cinnamon topping during weekend brunch!  That was a nice touch that I very much enjoyed.  My goal in traveling out to try this Cap City was to try the Crispy Fish & Chips off the gluten free menu, which is not offered at the Grandview location.  It was well worth it!  The fish is moist and flavorful, and the coating, made from Red Bridge gf beer and Bob's Red Mill gf flour, is light and crispy.  The fries were golden and perfect, and the slaw was delicious (and I'm not normally a slaw person).  The serving was quite generous, and I brought half home.Located in a shopping center, this Cap City also wins on ease of parking... it was plentiful, and easy to get in and out of this location.",Marissa C.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,2011/4/14,"True story: A long time ago, this was the first Cameron Mitchell restaurant I ever ate in.More years later than I want to admit, they haven't changed much, but I don't think that's so bad. You go to Cap CIty because you want the upscale diner atmosphere, the drinks, the well executed comfort food (dat mealoaf!!!) and going to a restaurant where the ""experience"" has been carefully crafted and polished over the years.I've never had a bad meal here, and on the rare occasions where I felt there was a problem, the staff was quick to respond and correct it. Aside from the meatloaf, some of my favorites here are the maytag bleu cheese chips, the crab cake sandwhich (stuffed to the brim with ACTUAL CRAB!), and their blue plate special Beef Stroganoff - fantastic, creamy, and almost overloaded with mushrooms!Somehow, despite going here again and again, I've never been for brunch - always lunch or dinner - but I have no doubt that it's just as solid. Oh, and don't forget to leave room for the truly massive chocolate cake...",Matt W.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,1,7/14/16,"Why have a table in bar area if one cannot get service. We sat there for 15 minutes- asked about service, given menus. No service. Not going back. Ever.",M P.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,3,10/13/14,"Went here the other night to celebrate a birthday and eat before a blue jackets game so it was pretty early.  Reservations were definitely not necessary at 5 pm...  However by 6 pm it was packed so I would definitely recommend reservations for normal dinner time.  It was early so there wasn't much ambiance.  We got stuck at a corner table.  I can tell they tried to give off a 50s diner vibe but it really isn't working at this location.  The one on Olentangy feels much more like a diner.  Something about the darkness of this spot reminds you that you are literally sitting next to a grocery store.We ordered pretty quickly and the food came out eerily fast.   I had the pork chops.  They were tiny if you were Hagrid from Harry Potter (honestly, I shouldn't have to explain that reference).  Okay, so they were massive.  The meat was super tender, but the glaze topping was too sweet and gave me Charlie and the Chocolate Factory flashbacks.  The cheddar mashed potatoes and spinach were  delightful.  I would order this again just for the sides.  That's how good they were.My friend ordered the meatloaf.  It was a massive pile of food that Hagrid couldn't even finish (2nd reference).  Needless to say, we needed boxes after about 5 minutes because we were stuffed full (this is a good thing).We knew we had to get dessert and ordered the key lime pie.  The pie was a work of art and it was pretty tasty.  My only complaint was it needed more lime.  I think everyone who has been falsely accused of opening the chamber of secrets would agree with me (hat trick).The service was excellent but I think I left a little disappointed overall.  I feel like for the price, you should get so much more.  But I would probably go back again if in the area because there isn't much else around here.  Stick to the sandwiches and plan on getting dessert.",Jeff H.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,5,9/28/16,Probably the best gluten free fish and chips anywhere!! They really take care of the gluten sensitive with many menu options available.  Service was attentive and timely. I come here every time I'm in Columbus.,Mike H.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,3,9/20/15,"Well, the rest of the group settled on Cap for our 200th birthday  (two of us just turned 70 and another 60; add it up).Tad over priced, but pretty decent beer and cheddar soup with bacon crumbles.  JMO, but needed diced green onions too.  I had the meatloaf and I rarely order commercially made meatloaf but had it at the Grandview site and it's pretty good, one other joined me in ordering the meatloaf. Another had salmon, one a veggie plate, one the eggs benedict,  one chicken Caesar, one the Cap City Trio, I believe.Didn't hear any complaints.  We did get desserts.  (they put candles on our celebrant's) and I obviously ordered the wrong dessert, their Big Cup'o Chocolate.  About all I can say is that it was in a big cup, dark brown, warm and sweet. I even saw a couple chocolate morsels but no chocolate flavor at all.I used a credit card.  I do not sign my cards, I put ""Request ID"" on the signature line.  Obviously never looked at the back, so ID wasn't requested.    Wonderful to see people again.  We all worked together at one time.  Took our time and at no time felt rushed.  Other than the CC, our server was fine.  Fun and food, what can you complain about.Just not someplace I'd go far out of my way to go back.  YMMV.",William D.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,2006/6/15,"As I'm fairly new to the Columbus area, I'm never short on suggestions from co-workers and acquaintances on what restaurants are the best in the area. I've heard from several people that Cap City is a Columbus-must, so we finally gave it a shot last night. They take reservations, which is always a plus on my list! I made a reservation for 7:30 on a Friday night - but we were just too hungry and made it in about 20 minutes early. It was busy and bustling with people, but there wasn't a wait and we were seated right away! I was surprised when we walked in the door... nothing about the restaurant screams ""Diner"" to me, outside of some diner-like options on the menu. Maybe it's just me, but when I think of ""diner"" I think of the atmosphere more than I think of the food. It's supposed to be a diner/artsy mixture, but I really didn't feel the diner vibe at all. Not having my expectations met wasn't a bad thing - I loved the decor and the vibe of the place, it was casual but not too casual, full of a variety of ages... there were couples and families and big groups.Our waitress was excellent. She made us feel the ""fine"" in Fine Dining & Bar. She was professional and polite, knowledgeable about the menu, available throughout our experience, friendly, and efficient! Now, the food! If you're looking for super cheap drinks, you're not in the right place. The cheapest beer on the menu was $4.50, which for a Bud Light, is not impressive. I ordered the non-alcoholic Peach Palmer and it came with an adorable little pitcher of its own, which ended up being about 2 1/2 drinks worth. Not bad for $3.49. Your meal starts with BREAD, which for some is an unwanted temptation and for others the most exciting part of the meal :-) These do make me think diner, if by diner you mean cheap and bland. Not great. Definitely not up to par with the menu items they offer.My husband got the Romano Crusted Chicken. It was good but not spectacular. The sauce was delicious, but the chicken didn't bring anything special to the table. I don't know that it's worth $17.29... but then again, it's one of the cheaper items on the ""large plates"" menu, so maybe if you spend more money you get your money's worth ;-) I got the Crab Cake Melt for 13.49 and it was AH-MAZING. The jalapeno remoulade really made the difference for me. I was unsure about the English Muffin when I ordered it, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I loved, loved, loved it!! Cap City really is a great experience with delicious food but I'm going to have to take a star away for the price. I don't know that I'm a fan of a casual atmosphere with a non-casual menu and price tag. If I want to spend a little more money on good food, I'm usually up for more of a ""date night"" atmosphere with a little bit of fancy in the mixture. There were kids everywhere, which is appropriate in the atmosphere, but I don't think I want to spend the money to eat at a place that has a mother and young son in a bit of a verbal brawl at the next table. Great experience, just not my style.",Sarah D.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,1/15/16,"Great food, fantastic service!!! The romano chicken is one of my favorites and I finally tried the Carrot Cake after hearing so many people rave about it. I have to say it was pretty good.. but doesn't compare to mine!",Sabrina H.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,11/23/12,"It was our first time here - my wife and I decided to take our daughter and my wife's parents here for dinner. They like meat and fish, I am a vegetarian (not vegan).Your meal starts with buttered rolls for everyone at the table. They were pretty good, my wife says she's had better.Two veggie options that I saw: 3-cheese grilled cheese or black bean veggie burger.  I do love black bean burgers, but since I'm quite familiar with them, I went for the grilled cheese. It had tomatoes, fried egg, scallions, and a dijon mayonnaise sauce. It was very good, as were the fries. You get your choice of fries, fresh fruit, coleslaw, or a couple of other things with any sandwich.My daughter had the kids' mac and cheese, which I also sampled. Very tasty.My mother-in-law ordered the fish and chips and my father-in-law ordered Philly Cheese steak. They both enjoyed their meal.We all agreed that the fries were very good. The service was great too, the waiter was on task the entire time, although it was pretty slow (Friday at 5pm).Plenty of soft drinks, wine, beer, and other to choose from. I was surprised that just offered ""coffee"", but nothing like a capuccino or special coffee drink, which I was sort of craving. But they are going for a standard diner menu, so I guess this makes sense.The decor and atmosphere were great. It was sort of a classic diner meets swanky restaurant type of feel. Kudos to the designers for the look and feel.I would recommend this place. If you're a meat eater, you have so much to choose from. Everything sounded pretty good, although a bit pricey. We're talkin' $10-20 a plate if you get anything more fancy than a grilled cheese. You're also paying for the experience of dining here. Even as a veggie, I was pleased. I'd go again - I don't know whether I'd get the grilled cheese again, the mac and cheese (if there is an adult portion), or the black bean burger!",Steve P.,,,,,,

Great decor, dining area, and energy!  The food is consistently good or better and you always know what to expect.Came in for lunch and ordered the Cap City Meatloaf.  It's a great, consistent product and a fan favorite.  Before the entree, fresh, buttered dinner rolls were served.  Pillowy, soft, fresh, and rich.  You can't eat just one!After a few short minutes the Mile High Meatloaf arrived.  The presentation was excellent and looked very close to Cameron's cookbook, ""The Art of the Meal.""  A garlic bread base, mashed potatoes, the ground veal, beef, and pork meatloaf, BBQ gravy, and crispy onions on top. Surrounded by a few choice pieces of steamed broccoli seasoned with butter.  To me, a rich, flavorful ""special occasion"" dish that is meant for mild indulgence.  Risked my life in ""white out"" snow conditions on 315 and I-270 for this meal!  Haven't had this dish in a few years, but as good as I always remembered it.For the most part, a great dining experience.  Great food, decor, and for the most part service.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,2007/1/13,"I think this might be my brunch spot for the forseeable future. I need to explore the myriad of lemonades on the menu. There were 3 of us at brunch yesterday, all sleepy and starving. This place hit the spot. The other 2 had mimosas while I went for the strawberry basil lemonade. The only thing I liked better than the lemonade was the rolls they set out; they were the usual Cap City rolls but with butter, cinnamon/sugar and a drizzle of glaze. The boyfriend was away from the table and we had to force ourselves to leave him one. I ended up with the breakfast burrito which was spicy, yet flavorful. It was stuffed with chorizo sausage and a light smattering of eggs (perfect proportions, IMO). The boy had the steak and eggs which looked good, although he wasn't impressed with the potatoes on the side. Our third had the stuffed french toast which looked amazing. She said they were sweet but not too sweet. Overall, I was pleased. We walked out of there a little lighter in the wallets but pleasantly full and happy.",Stephanie P.,,,,,,

Period.  I have always really enjoyed Cap City, however, it has been several years since our last visit.  So when we planned to visit for a birthday celebration I was excited to get back there.  We made a reservation for six and were seated fairly quickly when we arrived.  I was extremely disappointed to see the hostess walk us to a booth built for four and expect 6 adults to squeeze in.  If this meal was going to cost me $50 instead of $150, I still would have been disappointed with crowding in.  I couldn't say anything because I wanted to be sure I didn't ruin the mood.We all ordered interesting meals and they all were served professionally and looked great.  The part that really surprised us was that there is zero flavor in their food.  The pork chops were tough and bland.  The best thing on the plate was the cooked greens.  What did I just say? That's crazy.  The crusted chicken didn't have flavor either.   The southern fried chicken? Same thing.  What goes in this stuff? It all taste the same.  How do they make it look so good?  But can't give it a flavor or seasoning that makes it special?  I really thought that this food came off of a healthy recipe menu being pushed by Dr Oz.One of us were lucky and ordered the popular meatloaf and it was as good as we remembered it.  For that I give it the three stars.  The restaurant looks great and it is filled with people.  Makes it an interesting place to go.I did forget how bad their cheese dip is in the pretzel appetizer.  Don't order that.  The rolls that are served are as plain as a cheap piece of white sandwich bread.  Don't waste the calories.

The fried chicken was good but a little much on the honey for my taste.  We also had a slice of apple pie for desert where  the meal took a turn. We really did not like the pie.  I prefer a flaky pie crust made in the classic way with shortening.  The pie crust was made with butter and was the texture of a croissant.  It was very bad tasting and the texture was awful.  The seasoning of the pie was also poorly flavored.  I think they are trying too hard.  Use the home cooked inspiration you got for your meatloaf, fellas and apply it to you apple pie.  The slice was large but 8 bucks?  Not close to good value.  Cap city is good but  I'd avoid the apple pie until they get a new recipe.",Mike S.,,,,,,

Now I can only eat homemade burgers so I was a little worried. I ordered it medium well. Let me tell you, this was probably the best burger I ever had. It was cooked to perfection. The cooking area was extremely clean and organized. After dinner we ordered dessert.  Not wanting a large slice of cake that I would never finish, the waitress split the cake slice into thirds. That is how big one slice is. We took it to-go because we were so full. Later while in my hotel room I ate the cake. OMG, this chocolate cake was amazing.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,3,1/20/13,"Since moving to Columbus 7 years ago, I have been to Cap City in Gahanna dozens of times for both brunch and dinner. My favorite dish is the Balsamic Chicken. The portion is large, and the dish is extremely flavorful. I have never had a bad meal, but I also wouldn't rate the food best in Columbus. It is just consistently good. The service has also been good nearly every visit. My husband and I had a bad experience with a shift manager a couple of years ago which resulted in a loud argument in the dining room and me calling the general manager to complain. We also struggled with service when hosting a work holiday party there in December 2011. Small parties seem to fare better. Because of its dependable service and food quality, Cap City has been my restaurant of choice when entertaining out of town coworkers, and this will continue.",Danielle A.,,,,,,

It always seems to be busy when I'm there, which I take as a good sign.Meatloaf is their calling-card, I believe, but everything is good.

It was the perfect choice. Cap City delivered! Our guests were overly impressed with the decor, service, menu, and the complimentary cinnamon rolls. Then, when the food came out no one was complaining, or talking for that matter because the food was great. The BEST brunch I've had there to date. I hope they never take that breakfast burrito off the menu. I could have kicked myself for not ordering that before. Their prices beat Northstar and they have a better selection. Any restaurant that really impresses an out of towner and doesn't break the bank is a 5 star place in my book and I'll continue returning to Cap City with pleasure.",Liz M.,,,,,,

My hubby and I live across the street and order the creme brÌÈlÌ©e and carrot cake to go regularly when we need an indulgence!!!! The first trip was a bit of a shock-we had never been to a Cameron Mitchell restaurant and got a gift card as a gift. It was shockingly family oriented-so I was a bit over dressed-but I should have expected that!!! The only complaint I have is we made our reservations 3 weeks in advanced, and was sat in a booth with a family who had 3 screaming children. The hostess was clearly annoyed and very rude when we asked to be moved somewhere else-so we just stayed where we were sitting and told her to forget it. Our waitress was great, however-and I ordered the tilapia topped with crab imperial-do yourself a favor-GET THIS! I'm from maryland so I never order seafood here in Ohio-this is a great dish though. The potatoes and veggies (including zucchini-my fav!) that came with were perfect. My hubby got the meat loaf-if you're into meatloaf-this is it. The site of meatloaf typically turns my off-but he made me try a bite-and I can honestly say I'd consider ordering it myself.Like I said, desert was great as well. So glad to have found creme brÌÈlÌ©e near by-it's my fav!!! If you're looking for somewhere on the nicer side-but still family friendly -this is for you!",Rebecca L.,,,,,,

His hash was intensely delicious- there was a good balance of short rib, potato, onion and pepper.  My french toast was really good, the sauce was intense.  Overall, I would've liked to see more ""brunch"" items (there are only 6 listed and no pancakes or waffles, in fact the french toast is their only sweet option).

This place was pretty much the opposite!For dinner, I started out with the potato chips (which have some sort of blue cheese melted all over them!) Divine!! So tasty! Then had the meatloaf (of course) as I've heard all the raves over it. It was pretty much amazing, I must say! The bottom was a large piece of Texas toast, covered by a slab of meatloaf, topped with mashed potatoes and onion straws I believe. It'd definitely try it again!

We were seated right away.  Soon after we noticed part of the restaurant being set up for birthday party.  The service was spot on, even the manager Chase stopped by to check in, so the big party did not cause the service to suffer.  As for the food, I am on a bit of a restriced diet, so I went with the pan seared ribeye medium, and asked to leave off the garlic butter and mashed potato cake.  It came with the potato on the side (easy to put on another plate for family to share) but I can't have any oil or butter, and when I enquired they actually brought someone out from the kitchen to reassure me that it didn't have any butter.  It was pure, cooked to perfection, tender juicy steak heaven.  Steamed broccoli on the side was nice.  Next time I'm in town, I would go back.",Margaret W.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,2/13/12,"I thought I'd bump my review up a star.  I've been here a couple times in the last month or so (the latest being a few hours before writing this).  I think they've stepped up the service and quality a bit.  I don't know if it's a new manager or what but it's been a lot better.  The Flat Iron Potroast was really good.  It's one of the blue plate specials served on Thursdays.  The mussel app is really good too.  I had a scallop and lobster special tonight.  It was really good.  Scallops and chunks of lobster meat, nice cream sauce, green beans, and mash potatoes.  A little pricey at $26 but for scallops and lobster it's par for the course I guess.One minor complaint:  The spinach and apple salad sounds great on the menu but it leaves something to be desired.  I feel like the oversized chunks of cheddar cheese are misplaced.  It should be served with small crumbles of goat cheese or gorgonzola or something.   Maybe it could be substituted, I don't know.",Mike H.,,,,,,

My last visit it seemed like they changed the burger patty, a little thinner and more dry, which was good and bad. The burger wasn't as moist, but it was cooked. My previous visit I had been served a thick turkey burger that was raw in the middle. The staff made it right, and packaged a properly cooked one to go since at that point my husband finished his meal and I was tired and prefered to eat it later (delicious the next day!!).  So while I had one bad experience with the previous burger (out of dozens), i thought the old thicker ones had more flavor but more risk of not cooking through. I have tried other dishes, this is just my goto since it is something i normally wouldn't have at home.My husband usually gets the meatloaf and is very happy with the taste and portions.The happy hour is a great time to come! It is always fun eating at the bar and trying out new drinks. The food is good. Love the Pepperoni Flatbread and wings. The mussels seem to usually be sold out, but recently we finally were able to try this dish out. The mussels were good but not great.For the price the food is good but nothing special. It could be just that the menu has changed very little over the past 10 years, and a lot of the dishes my husband cooks better at home. For the price I want something a little more special.",Crystal K.,,,,,,

We went to the Gahana location around 11:30 and the restaurant was half empty so we were seated right away.  The Server took our drink order and then disappeared maybe 15 mins later she returned with some of the drinks and it took a while to get the rest.  The rest of the meal was the same way Server was nowhere to be found.  We're a pretty low maintenance group but I'd like to see somebody stopping by occasionally just to see if anybody has been sitting with an empty glass for 10 minutes.With 6 people we ordered a good sample of items from the menu and it was good but not great as it has been in the past.

I was just talking about the roasted garlic and baguette that they used to serve at Cameron's the other day.  I *still* miss it.  But I digress.Cap City is one of my standbys for good solid food that will fill you up...and give you your money's worth.The Chopped Salad is fantastic.  So fantastic that I've started to see similar on other restaurants menus!  I don't know what they do to make their dressing (or where they get it from), but it's unlike any other ranch I've ever had.  Full of flavor and not gloppy, more liquidy.The Romano Crusted Chicken is a gut buster, so plan for leftovers!  Three chicken breasts come on this dish, with a side of delicious pasta and a tomato drizzle.However, I saved the best for last.  The Maytag Blue Cheese Chips.  I don't care if you think it sounds weird.  Buy it anyway.  You WILL thank me later.  So unbelievably good, and you can get it for take out!  They box the sauce up separately, so you can assemble a fresh delight when you get home.  *Drool*",Mindy W.,,,,,,

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,10/30/11,"I love Cap City! Its one of my favorite restaurants for a casual non planned night out.  My favorite entrees are the Romano Crusted Chicken, Meatloaf, and the Pecan crusted pork chops.  Many times I go just for salad too, I love the Apple Spinach one, but I substitute the dressing.  Their Waldorff Dressing is AMAZING!!! I must have it on any salad I order there.  I wish I could buy some to take home. When I get a salad, I usually get the peel and eat shrimp for an app, which is perfectly seasoned with Old Bay. YUM!!I love this place because you can eat a lot or a little. The prices are a bit high for such a casual place, but the quality is just so much better than say, Applebees or Fridays.  I would rather pay a couple extra dollars and get better food and service.  Their servers are all well trained and very attentive.  Such a nice change after having bad service so often at other places.  Joanna is awesome, she is full of suggestions and has that perfect blend of humor and friendliness.Brunch was a little disappointing when I went, but maybe I ordered the wrong thing, I would be willing to try again.  The other thing that I usually find disappointing is their wine list.  This always surprises me for a Cameron Mitchell restaurant, but again, maybe I just seem to pick the wrong thing.  I'm going to try wine night this week, maybe I'll choose better this time.  :)Also, seriously needs a patio!!!",Kristie K.,,,,,,

The appetizers were more in price then the meal I had even ate, I'm normally a fan of blue cheese but what ever they did to it it tasted like a big fried snot bubble.  It was so bad. The mood was alright about the place but the managers tried too hard and buzzed around like flys asking people questions. The bread that came before the appetizer was soaked in nasty butter and the 'butter' they put on top was old and gritty tasting like it was the last bit in a old tub sitting out all day. The chicken pasta was alright but by the time I got halfway through it, and my boyfriend got the same and can agree that it was not worth it.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,2010/10/10,"I was excited to see a ""diner"" nearby when I first moved to Columbus, but when I checked their website and saw their prices it was clear to me this was not a real diner, it's almost a ""diner-themed"" nice restaurant or something.  That disappointment aside, I like the retro decor, and the comfort food style menu. The prices are a bit much for the food you're getting (more than a place like Max & Ermas), so this is not a casual dining for every occasion, but nice on occasion. I read the reviews here and everyone raved for the Maytag blue cheese chips, so we decided to try them, despite me hating bleu cheese because our waitress said that even people who don't like bleu cheese still love them. Everyone in my party was unimpressed. I really am not sure what the appeal is there...and I have to disagree with the waitress, the bleu cheese was very evident (in certain bites) and was pretty gross for those of us who hate the stuff.Our dinners were pretty good, though there was a broad range of ratings at our table. We got a thumbs down for the ravioli and an enthusiastic thumbs up and even a ""one of the best things I've eaten"" review on the fried chicken. Chicken and salmon dishes for a ""pretty good"" rating.It wouldn't be a favorite, but I'd be all for going again if the occasion arose.",Anne C.,,,,,,

The upscale diner felt forced and made my experience awkward. However, this same concept in the Gahanna strip-mall seemed to work!Another reason I'm raising my rating on Cap City is their amazing brunch menu! I'm a girl who loves her brunch, and Cap City offered up some delicious ""diner"" fare with thoughtful twists that you wouldn't see in a greasy spoon diner. Eggs on Hash allows you to taste the short rib - the same Cola Braised Short Ribs they serve on Saturdays for $19.95. The Hash version of these short ribs top a pile of hash, green peppers, caramelized onions and Vermont White Cheddar. Oh yeah, and topped with two fried eggs. All for under $10, this allows you to sample the short ribs and decide if you want to come back and spend twice as much a dinner's worth of short ribs. And trust me, you do. Brilliant!I was really impressed with the Eggs Benedict. Such a wonderful thick flavor in the sauce. And such thick cuts of bacon! Mm, I would always recommend this to a friend.The service I experienced at this Cap City was generally more pleasant and welcoming than the service I experienced in Grandview.Good job!

I've been known to come just for the seriously big chocolate cake.My favorite reason to visit Cap City is for their brunch. It's a classic brunch menu. Their usual dinner rolls transform into magical cinnamon rolls. My friends and I usually go through several baskets. I usually opt for the omelet.

I ordered the appetizer Maryland Crab Cakex2 as an entree and boy was it a great  balanced dish. It had which I believe it to be balsamic  surrounding the cakes with tomato salsa in the middle to compliment the main dish. Very neat, clean fresh seafood taste. A great choice if you are the type to portion control, or just not that hungry. My date had Shrimp Linguini, which had like a slightly lemon taste, but he says it was awesome. Very well cooked shrimp, and overall a great dish, especially if your a pasta lover. Only issue I would say, is that it maybe a bit too overpriced. Maybe. I feel like if everything was about $2-$7 cheaper, then I would rate it 4 stars. Prices are about $30 and under.",Sagim T.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,3,2009/3/12,"Went here with my sister awhile ago for drinks.  It was cold, so we ended up trying some scotch to warm our bones.  I love scotch, and my sister was getting a bit of an introduction to it, so we tried a couple different ones to see what she liked most.  The bartender was nice and attentive, and our choice of spirits attracted attention.  You see, women don't usually drink scotch.  It puts hair on your chest.  I think the guys were going to buy us a drink... until they realized it was scotch.  You see, our bill was around $160.  Yeah.  We were shocked, too.  And all we could do was laugh.  Maybe the amount of alcohol we consumed made us jolly instead of angry.  I drink scotch all the time, so I know it can be expensive, but damn!  We had no idea how much each glass cost, but when it's THAT expensive, I think they should tell you.  Good times, nonetheless.  Would like this place more if it weren't in a strip mall.  Yes, I'm a strip mall snob.",Lisa G.,,,,,,

She was so geeked to take us there.  :(  I dont even want to say anything bad so I'll keep it LIGHT, in case she sees this.  hahahahha!  UMMMMM...where do I start?  I wasnt sure what to expect when I walked in.  The decor has an old school vibe to it, with linens on the table.  The waitress was everything you could ask for!!  Cute, Friendly, helpful and all that stuff we like!  My drink was great!!!! I'll start with that....Again...this is a common theme.  I must have some kinda problema I'm not aware of.  hahaha! However.....you know when you're staring at a menu and nothing jumps out at you and you're like WTF?  It took me forever to order something b/c I didnt WANT anything on the menu.  THAT'S WACK!!!!!!  REAL WACK!!!  I mean....the waitress was really confident about the food and I'm still trying to figure out WHY? I ordered the chicken parmesean on angel hair noodles.  It was okay....but I could've made it better at home!  UGH!!!!!!  I just wasnt really impressed with the selection and I would not let her drag me back.  But, it really is a nice place.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,4,11/22/08,"Who says there's no good diners in Columbus?! Right back atcha!This bustling bistro is another marvelous masterpiece devised by our very own home-grown native, Cameron Mitchell. Cap City Fine Diner is not your typical ""diner"" like those that developed my highly-paid professional pallet back in New Jersey. The Greater Philadelphia & New York Diners are unbelievable to say the least. The menus are as long as the Constitution with every type of entree you can imagine. That type of menu isn't necessary for Mitchell's success. He takes the best of the best and adds more flavor than can can actaully fit into the portions. Their website states that they add ""upscale touches"" to the typical diner favorites. Their creations burst in every bite!Speaking of flavor, we always, always, always order the Veggie Platter either as an appetizer or an entree. Talk about unique and creative! You have to order it. I won't ruin the surprise by discussing all the details. As for the rest of the menu, you can't go wrong with the hot and tasty soups. Any meat and potato entree will please tantalize your taste buds, especially the meatloaf and mashed potatoes! Ohhhhhh Yeeeeaaaah! Now we're talkin'!You can dine-in and experience a high-energy crowd either in the dining room or at the boisterous bar. Or, you can order your feast to go and enjoy all that flavor at home or better yet, at somebody else's so that you don't have to do all the cleaning. :) Enjoy the experience of Columbus' most succesful restauranteur and unleash your taste buds for some real flavorful fun!",Roy H.,,,,,,

We paid 76 bucks for 2 short rib plates, one desert, one ice tea, and 2 coffees( 2.99 each cup, that's crazy and wasn't special).  It will be a very long while before we come back.  There is something not so special about this place anymore.  The short rib is such a cheap piece of beef.  22 bucks I can't get over that.",Matthew H.,,,,,,
Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,2,2007/11/10,"Generally when I go to a restaurant, I'll scan the menu, and four or five dishes will stand out right away, based on their ingredients/descriptions.  Then I spend the next few minutes trying to decide between those four or five dishes.  When I go to Cap City, I dunno, nothing ever seems to appeal to me based on the menu.  I look and look, and can't get enthused about anything.  Eventually I pick something, and it's always competent, but never outstanding.  Maybe someone can suggest a dish to me that will change my mind.Another note... the chocolate cake.  Everyone loves the chocolate cake, because the serving size could keep a third-world country well-fed for a week.  I am not impressed by quantity.  I can't comment on the quality because I've never ordered it, but just seeing one of those slabs of cake being delivered to a table annoys me.",Dennis L.,,,,,,

There's nothing extraordinary about Cap City's Sunday Brunch, but everything is consistently good. Every time. We usually show up with our large brunching crowd, and Cap City is always happy to make accommodations for us.  The servers are always extremely helpful, efficient, and professional.  The food is always good - never hit or miss.  Oh, and don't even get me started on the sweet rolls they bring before the meal!  So, go to Cap City and try anything on the brunch menu - with confidence that it'll be a good experience!

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,3,2003/12/10,"I recently came to this location for the 'boyfriend meeting the parents for the first time' dinner and it was a great choice!  I've always liked the food at the other location but we chose this one because it was the weekend with the Arnold Festival and the home and garden show and the gallery hop and we knew that everything closer to downtown would be packed.  I think every one else thought the same thing.We had made reservations and the hostess at the door informed us that they were running behind and it would be about 15 minutes.  Exactly 15 minutes later we were called.  I don't mind having to wait when they are so on top of things as they are.  Our server was nice but didn't seem overly interesting in making sure that our drinks were kept full and coming back to get our orders after getting our drink orders.I had one of their turkey Reuben sandwiches which I love that they use coleslaw instead of sauerkraut which gives it a nice, not-greasy crunch.  Unfortunately, I couldn't have my favorite part of Cap City Diner - the dessert - I gave up sweets for Lent!  I counted it off one star just because the other location is my favorite because of the patio.  Still a great pace to come and I recommend it.",Amy S.,,,,,,

The dishes are far from what you'd expect at a diner, and the balsamic chicken with spinach and peppers is to die for!The service can be slow on occasion, but it's worth the wait., especially if you've managed to save room for dessert.  My husband loves the creme brulee, but for me it's go big or go home, and that means ordering a slice of the chocolate cake.  It's easily big enough to serve three, and there's nothing quite like taking half home and taking it to work for lunch the next day.All in all I highly recommend Cap City!",Sabrina L.,,,,,,

But with a roll the meal was just enough for lunch.Colleagues had everything from the fork and knife hot dog (looked delicious) to the meatloaf (great presentation).Since most of the colleagues had not ate here before I ordered the chocolate cake, I love a good laugh.  It was hysterical when they delivered one slice and one fork.   One slice of cake at this diner can feed a family.  Of course I shared and had some left over.Lunch was good.",Meredith M.,,,,,,

If you go for brunch on the weekends, be sure to try the complimentary cinnamon rolls - delicious!Like other reviewers, I suggest getting the Maytag Blue Cheese chips - always a crowd pleaser.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,2,9/14/13,Very disappointing meal there.  Cucumber pear gimlet cocktail was watery and didn't taste like pear at all.  Bad drink.  But the glass of wine was nice.  The Saturday blue plate special was a huge plate of overcooked food.  But the side of wild rice salad was excellent.  The service was poor in that the waiter seemed really out of it and it took him forever to bring things at 9:30 pm when the place was not very crowded.  Pretzel and cheese dip appetizer was the best part of the meal.  I had not eaten at a Cap City Diner in probably 6 or 7 years; the last time was at the one on Olentangy River Road.

Cap City Fine Diner and Bar - Gahanna,182,4,5,10/13/08,"I love this Cap City for family events and expense account lunches. It is food so good you will forget its not really healthy fare.Gahanna's Cap City is different from Grandview's because of volume both in people and sound. You can actually have a conversation here during lunch, and get a reservation for dinner. I am nutty over the turkey Reuben, skillet beans, and chicken Romano. The meatloaf and balsamic chicken are also popular favorites. For those who want to pretend to health food, try the salads. Each salad excluding the Cesar and House are truly big enough to constitute a meal. If you are still worried this won't fill you up, get a cup of their chili. The chili is full of flavor and goes nicely dipped in bread.Insider secret...Speaking of the dinner rolls, you can easily order them not baked and take home ready.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,8/28/17,"We decided last minute to splurge Saturday night. We wanted to try a place that we had never been to before. We had meaning for years to try Cameron's American Bistro, it is the original, where it all began for the famous Cameron Mitchell's restaurants. We did not have reservations. We hoped that they had a bar. When we arrived the hostess greeted us pleasantly and she said that they have full service at their bar. It is inviting and modern. The restaurant is quaint, and beautiful inside. We explained to our bartender that this was our very first visit and she made us feel extremely welcomed. We started with the cocktail shrimp which tasted perfect. Hot bread with a whole roast garlic was also served. Our bartender explained that you spread the garlic on the bread and it was amazing. I had never had roasted garlic like that before and I can't wait to impress my friends and do it at home. My main dish was the teriyaki salmon and it was cooked to absolute perfection. It made my mouth so happy. We both agreed that after this wonderful dinner and experience we can't wait to get back to Cameron's for a truly amazing evening.",Fawn S.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,3,2001/1/18,"Cameron's has been a bit of a tradition for my wife and I during New Year's Eve over the past decade. Like most establishments in the CM portfolio they throw out party favors and comped bubbly before the ball drops. It is always fun and I always enjoy bringing friends to this event in one of the more intimate restaurant options available.That being said...Over the years I have seen menu prices go up, and while the food quality is very, very good, it has become more of a place that puts emphasis on plating and service over quantity or innovative ingenuity. For a place that bills it's distinction on a quirky fusion of flavors that spins the idea of American bistro comfort food on its head, it doesn't really inspire me any longer. I think that Cameron's is coasting on a steady diet of aging locales perfectly content to play $25+ for the privilege of experiencing the same safe meal, surrounded by the same safe faces, enjoying the same safe experience.It may help pad the bottom line but it just feels stifling with so many other options out there now, even other locations run by the Cameron Mitchell organization. The Barn and The Pearl are both excellent examples of uniqueness padded with consistency that the oldest of the family, so to speak, can borrow a page from to remain relevant in years to come.One note of extreme merit however - whoever tended bar that night is an angel. He or she poured me the tallest glass of high shelf scotch (Laguvalin 16!!) I have *ever * seen. I even attached a photo of it here as proof. Hats off to you, whoever you are.",Brent F.,,,,,,

In my opinion, and my opinion only, I believe there may be better options when it comes to value.  We started our dinner with the Calamari and Flatbread. The red chili's that accompany the Calamari really set this apart from other similar dishes we've had around Columbus.  For my dinner, I went with the baked Flounder & Crab Cake.  It was exactly as I would expect from a CM restaurant - on point with flavor and plate presentation. I would definitely order this special again.  We went on a Friday night.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,1/18/17,"Overall rating was pretty close to a 5, I am just being really picky here. I did really enjoy my dining experience here at Cameron's American Bistro! Highly recommend! [Service] Very friendly staff. She was attentive enough, but not overly, which left me and my friend a great space to catch up. Waiting time between each course was just about right.  [Ambience]Feels pretty cozy. Tables were kind of close to each other. Requesting for booth would probably be a better idea, which we did. It's not a huge restaurant, not a lot of seats so I would suggest calling ahead of time to make reservations. By the time we left, I saw quite a few groups waiting by the entrance. Liked the music, but it was loud...can barely hear anything. It may not be a suitable restaurant if you are coming with a new date, yet should work out nicely with a not so new date - if that makes sense! [Parking, Location]Oddly located in a strip mall. Parking spots are limited so depend on your luck! [Food]- BreadFluffy, warm, sourdough-like bread. Served with butter and a bulb of roasted garlic. Loved it. It was different from anywhere else. We ate too many slices without realizing. Way over stuffed before we even started our meal...-Appetizer: Oysters bingo, must tryPrepared perfectly. Asiago aioli Parmesan brought some of that cheesy taste, but thankfully not too cheesy!! Just about the right amount to cover up the sometimes not so pleasant seafood smell/taste. Creamed spinach perfectly blended in with cheese and oysters.-Entree: Braised beef short ribsRib was very tender, not overly braised - I am glad that it was cooked to the right taste. Potatoes were good. Just not so much the roots vegetables. May be slightly undercooked. Still a great dish though! -Dessert: Creme BrÌÈlÌ©e, must try I have an addiction to creme brÌÈlÌ©e. I order it wherever I go. Theirs was fantastic!!! Very creamy and silky. Top part was not overly sweet which may sometimes stick into teeth (pretty annoying I know, if you've had the same experience as me, you know what I mean). The berries on top were sweet and fresh. I hate when I have to consume sour fruits on desserts! [Others]Restroom wasn't the prettiest haha I had expected more!",Mirabelle L.,,,,,,

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,2011/5/16,"Cameron's is such a nice restaurant and this is also Cameron Mitchell's first restaurant of many around Columbus. Our waitress explained that their culture is that ""the answer is always yes, and they will modify anything on the menu to your preference.""Our meals were wonderful. This is the kind of restaurant that you go to because you can't possibly make something that amazing at home. We shared the crab cake appetizer and it was so smooth and delicious! It comes on a unique slaw with mustard that pairs perfectly! Although the crab cake is generously large, I wanted more!! I had the teriyaki salmon and it was cooked to perfection over a sticky rice. SO good! There was a mushroom layer between the salmon and the rice that I didn't care for, so I must have missed that on the menu when I ordered. I usually love mushrooms but I've had these particular mushrooms before and I wasn't a fan. They're sort of chewy instead of melt-in-your-mouth, so beware if you don't like that. (Not sure what they're called, sorry!)My husband had the scallops and he was very impressed. He makes scallops at home a lot and is a pretty impressive chef, but again, not just anyone can cook like the chef at Cameron's!All that being said, the location is unexpected because it's amidst a strip mall and next door to a Wendy's. We had a table by the window and my view was of cars and the UDF across the street. I do think that detracts from the ambiance a little bit, but if you're not by the front window, you probably don't even notice. It was also a bit chilly by the window on a November evening! Still giving 5 stars because Cameron's is an impressive meal that is certainly a special treat!",Sarah T.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,2001/12/17,"We dined on a Saturday night with friends--a family of four with a teenage daughter and ten year old son. One diner had allergies that required special preparation, and the server consulted with the chef before presenting several tempting arrangements that had me debating my selection. (Note: a special ""allergy"" menu with two or three options would be a great addition.) Not only did the chef have a great command of her provisions, the server delivered the selections in a patient and very pleasing manner. The ten year old ordered from the children's menu, which was full of kid-friendly favorites. He even got an ice cream treat as a bonus. Everyone was happy with their food; it even inspired me to cook a similar dinner on Sunday night.The restaurant is very stylish on the inside...much nicer than one may assume from the exterior. The staff was very pleasant and attentive.",Michael R.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,1,8/25/17,"My husband and I love this restaurant however we just had such an awful experience that I'm not sure we will return. We put our name in with the hostess and then walked over to the bar to order a cocktail while we waited. Something we have done several times before. Standing at the bar, four seats opened up and my husband and I sat down along with a couple of guys whom we didn't know. After the bartender served us our drinks he asked us to get up and give our seats to another couple who had been apparently standing around the bar for 30 minutes. The bar is first come first serve. We have never been asked to get up once we have sat down because someone else had been waiting for an area that is FIRST COME FIRST SERVE! If you aren't paying attention and seats open up at the bar that's your problem..",Judy S.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,4/29/16,"We dined at Cameron's for my boyfriend's birthday. It was our first time there and I have to say it was a great experience! We made reservations and were seated immediately by the friendly hostess. The service here was awesome. Our waitress kept our drinks full, was super knowledgeable about the menu and the ingredients in the dishes, and to our surprise - offered a free birthday dessert!Everything from the bread service with roasted garlic to our dessert was exactly you'd expect from a Cameron Mitchell restaurant - delicious.We split the goat cheese salad and I had the vegetable plate. I knew it was going to be tasty - but I was so happy it exceeded my expectations! The eggplant was perfectly crisp and the marinara had the slightest kick. The sweet corn ravioli was really interesting, not something I've ever had before! My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his steak and it was cooked to perfection.We shared the lemon gratin for dessert. It was both light and decadent.Overall I was really happy with our experience and I'll definitely be back!",Amanda C.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,2002/9/15,"This was one of the few Cameron Mitchell restaurants that I hadn't tried, so when I received a coupon for BOGO entrees, I figured it was time to try it out.The restaurant can be a little hard to find as it is in a small strip mall; not your typical Cameron Mitchell location. I called a few days before and tried to make a reservation for a Sunday night. No such luck, the earliest they had was 9:30PM...So we decided to arrive on the earlier side with the hopes of getting a table, but the wait was already an hour at 5:15, so we put our name in and headed to the Crafty Pint across the street. About 20 minutes later, Cameron's called saying the table was ready! I was shocked, and also slightly disappointed that I had to abandon my beer at Crafty Pint, but we promptly headed back over.I ordered the salmon and my roommate had the scallops. Both were delicious and seemed to be on the same level as seafood dishes from Fish Market and Cap City. In fact, the salmon tasted and looked almost identical to the salmon dish at Cap City.To end our meal, we ordered carrot cake and we were not disappointed. It was served warm with fresh cream cheese icing and candied carrots on top. YUM! This is a great romantic restaurant for a birthday or anniversary, it's small and quiet. But if you're looking for a place for just an every day dinner or a place to take kids, I would choose Cap City or Fish Market over Cameron's.",Gina M.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,1,2/15/17,"The food and service are great. I would spend boatloads of money here since I eat out probably 3x per week and I like a regular place with a nice bar and good bourbon based cocktails - all of which this place has. However, I will not ever go back due to the geriatric bigots who sat next to us at the bar.  They were clearly regulars because the bartender knew their names and drinks - so I figure, to enjoy this place is to endure those people.  So, if you love loud drunk anti-semitic septuagenarians, this place is for you.  If you prefer to hold the hate with your meal, you may want to get a table.",Den W.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,2/17/17,"I have been coming to Camerons now for years. I started as a young kid coming for dinner or even Easter brunch with my parents. I have celebrated many birthdays here, and now as an adult still eat here with my boyfriend. It is an absolute classic with wonderful food, a great atmosphere, and even better staff.",Steph A.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,11/13/14,"First visit to this outpost of the ever expanding Cameron Mitchell empire for a Date Night dinner.  Cameron's American Bistro is smaller and more intimate than some of the other CM restaurants, but better for it I think.  It also feels less contrived than some of the newer CM restaurants like The Pearl and Hudson 29.For starters my wife went with the Caesar Salad, which she enjoyed.  I had the Bingo Oysters which were freaking awesome.  Oysters on the half shell with a cheese crust?  Please and thank you.  Seriously, if you don't have these with dinner I will point and laugh at you.  Our main courses were Filet Mignon for my wife and Braised Beef Short Rib for me.  Both were excellent, playing to Cameron Mitchell's strengths--cow-based protein.  I actually prefer the American Bistro version of Filet Mignon to the Ocean Club version.  The demi glace around the filet was very tasty.Special mention goes to the roasted garlic served with the bread--awesome stuff.  I try not to fill up on bread and butter before dinner, but I couldn't help myself because of the butter/garlic combo.  And I don't feel bad about it either.As always, the service was excellent.  I think I've found my new favorite Cameron Mitchell restaurant.",Vin R.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,2010/2/16,"Great menu and service. They have a half priced wine special on Sundays as well. We had a great meal and our waitress and the other staff were attentive and knowledgeable. We had the mushroom gnocchi as an appetizer which was delicious. The chop chop salad is awesome and we had the crab cakes and filet as entrees which were both delicious. We'll definitely be back!",Ryan S.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,2012/5/16,"In typical Cameron style the dishes were simple but nicely executed. The asparagus soup was delicious but would have benefited from a pass though a fine chinois to remove all of the ""pulp"". The short rib was also tasty but the mashed potatoes were a bit loose and the glazed root crop consisted largely of steamed carrots. Dessert was the best part of the meal, a flawless cashew and hazelnut tart. Service was terrific.",Michael M.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,2007/8/17,"From the hostess greeting to our dessert, everything was perfect.  Our first visit, but not our last.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,2,2009/11/17,"So much for our favorite Birthday Dinner spot. We made the mistake of driving from Sunbury and arriving at opening with no reservation(our fault I know) but since the place was always empty when we made our 5pm reservations, we decided to hold off this night. The dining area was mostly empty like we are accustomed to but were told it would be a 45 minute wait and we could sit at the bar. No problem, we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks. After 45 minutes we gave up our seats at the bar so others could use them. We then waited another 15 minutes while the 2 hostesses acted like they worked at Fridays and avoided eye contact. My wife asked how much longer the wait would be and was told ""oh it's going to be at least another 1/2 hour.""  We then headed back home and stopped by Brio's so we could eat something and actually ended up having a wonderful meal. I am sure the meal at Cameron's would have been very good but the front end help will make us never come back.",Dean R.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,4/29/16,"Since we moved back to Ohio, to Columbus specifically, all we've heard about is how much Columbus has become a ""foodie's delight"" and that this renaissance is due to the local chef and restaurateur Cameron Mitchell.  My first reaction was ""Cameron Who?"".  If you don't live in Columbus, you've probably never heard of him.  He has branched out to eleven other cities across the US (e.g. NYC, Beverly Hills, Denver, and Dallas), but he doesn't have the name recognition that someone like Bobby Flay or even Cleveland's Michael Symon has.  But, we've been wanting to try one of his local restaurants for the past two years, happened to be in the area of his first Columbus restaurant, American Bistro, and were due a night out -- so we grabbed the opportunity.We walked in the door early, just before 5, and the wait staff was still in it's pre-shift meeting, but were warmly greeted and offered to wait in the bar to be seated as soon as the restaurant was ready.First of all, we were hit with the sound of jazz as soon as we walked in.  Perfect.  The restaurant's a bit small -- the waiting area's small, the seating area is small, the bar is average size, but combined with the music, dimmed lights, and decoration, it's comfortable, classy, and cozy.The bartender was great and the drinks even better.  My better-half ordered an old favorite, and Appletini, and I asked for one of the custom house drinks, a Red Whiskey.  Fantastic.  I'll hope that mine is still on the drink menu the next time we come back.  The wife said hers was the best she's had in a long while.We were seated in about 10 minutes...just enough time to take one sip of our drinks.I cannot say enough good things about the wait staff -- our servers and the rest of the staff were quick, smiling, attentive, and friendly.  Special kudos to Becky our server.June had the roast chicken with asparagus and fingerling potatoes.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sides were wonderful.  I had the Walleye with garlic potatoes and sauteed french green beans.  Becky had mentioned that the Walleye was a favorite, seasonal, and was just added back to the menu.  I'm not a big Walleye fan, but I tried it.  Pretty good.  I know that's not a glowing review, but I did clean my plate...so there's that.  Oh...I will say that I'm not a big fan of overcooked green beans.  These were not overcooked.  They were dead-on wonderful -- crisp and tasty.Cameron's was also offering a new wine they added to the list, Cote du Rhone Blanc, by the glass that night.  It was a perfect compliment to the fish.When a restaurant's floor manager or host stops by to ask you how your meal went, it's usually polite but perfunctory and quick.  Cameron's was not quick but chatty, helpful, and genuine.  I guess we struck the right cord because we got a complimentary dessert that night.  Yeah!  (And...no...I don't write favorable reviews for a free apple crisp.  I'm not that cheap or easy. :)).This is not one of Cameron Mitchell's biggest or fanciest restaurants...but it's one that we will always remember, bring friends to, and make our new ""favorite place"" in Columbus.",Dave D.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,5/17/16,"Wonderful experience from beginning to end.  In town for the night, and we always try to find great restaurants...this one exceeded expectations.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,1,2/13/17,"The food was great and the service from the bartender was outstanding. Unfortunately, the clientele at the bar ruined the night.  The regulars seem to be a bunch of aging bigots whose overly loud conversation consisted of anti-Semitic slurs, gossip about all the lawyers in town, and lots of other intolerant comments.  Oh yeah-and napkin throwing over our heads. They ruined what was to be an early valentine's day dinner.  Given they were known by name and clearly the regular crowd, we won't be going back. If you're a bigot, you'll have a nice dinner.  Everyone else, try one of the many other wonderful restaurants in town.",Rebecca N.,,,,,,

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,2003/9/16,"My wife and I had a very enjoyable dinner here last night. This was our first visit to this restaurant and although it seems smaller than most of the places owned by Mr. Mitchell, it was set up well and seemed to be almost full of patrons. The staff here looked alert & happy and they did smile a lot, so right from the minute you walked in the door, you feel welcomed. We had a 7:00pm reservation and although I was 15 minutes early, they led me to our table straight away. My wife joined me about 10 minutes later and we started looking over the menu.The menu was full of the kind of dishes we had been used to seeing back in the SF Bay area. Lots of fresh fish, (Salmon, Trout and Snapper), and a few steaks but there were also dishes like what I ordered, which was the pork chop with clams. My wife ordered the Dixie Fried Chicken.When our food came, it looked spectacular. I should have taken photos, as it looked that good. Best part was, it tasted even better. The pork chop and clams came with a pan jus, which totally made the dish great. The chop was large, the clams were fresh and took no time at all to go through them all. The fried chicken was two pieces, the breast and the thigh. Both had a semi sweet taste to them, with that super satisfying crunch that comes with this dish when perfectly cooked. We tried to save some food for leftovers, but it was not to be, we ate it all.For dessert, my wife ordered the Creme Brule, which was larger then we imagined, perfect for two people to split!Yes, this restaurant is a little pricey and yes, it's not in the fanciest neighborhood, but we will be going back!",Jay P.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,2004/8/15,"Still a great choice...This is Cameron's first restaurant.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,2004/4/16,"Giving Cameron's a top rating since we came here for Easter brunch, which in many places can be a bit of a mob scene! However, the management had everything organized perfectly! Not too crowded, tables spaces well, host and seating efficient (they were setting up appetizers by the door in case there was a line later). As for the food, it was great! A good variety to choose from and we ended up pretty stuffed! Our waitress was prompt with drink refills, and the room was decorated nicely. Interesting architecture-it felt hospitable. Would be worth trying again on a regular evening. Giving a top rating because I appreciate how holiday brunches can be hard to run perfectly.",Keith S.,,,,,,

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,2006/4/16,"Had a birthday dinner for my sister and finally made it to Cameron's. As other Cameron Mitchell restaurants classy decor nice atmosphere.. Ordered 2 appetizers crab cake and calamari .. Highly recommend calamari coated lightly tasty light delicious.. Looked and tasted like zucchini chips.. Delicious, with lemon wedges fried as garnish.. Crab Cake was ok, after living in Maryland for many years I have high expectations for the tasty cakes.. Cameron's version was average, undersized for $13... Pass on it.. Dinners included 2 walleye dinners, trout, and a caeser salad. Caeser salad very tasty with shaved yarns of Parmesan and just the right amount of dressing.. Ordered mushroom Gnocchi as accompaniment, tasty but light and not filling..Walleye dinners were exceptional, walleye cooked perfectly, light, 2 pieces over a mash and tasty green beans.. Highly recommend the dish.. Trout was flaky full of flavor, cooked perfectly.. Dessert was Meyer lemon gratin.. Similar to a lemon cheesecake (I think they used ricotta), with hard sugary top via creme brÌÈlÌ©e and excellent vanilla sauce and berries... Recommend and big enough to share with a friend... Our service was outstanding, waters were constantly filled and Kraft of Iced Tea placed on table for us.. Restrooms clean, with mouthwash for post dinner swish...Really nice experience, thanks again Cameron Mitchell for making our celebration special ...",Chris C.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,2009/12/14,"A hidden gem in the Linworth neighborhood off of 161, Cameron's is one of our favorite Cameron Mitchell restaurants.

I took my wife here for our anniversary dinner on 9/10/14. We've been coming here on and off for about 5 years now, and we've yet to have a bad meal here. All of their entrees are excellent, and reasonably priced. One thing that's pretty unique about this restaurant is that they will bring out a whole clove of roasted garlic to use as a spread on your bread. For those of you worried about your breath afterwards, they have complementary mouth wash in the bathroom. lol.",Kaoru M.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,2008/11/14,"Went for a birthday dinner and we all had an excellent meal. It started with amazing, still-warm sourdough bread served with butter and roasted garlic. The garlic really made it amazing.I ordered the vegetable plate but requested that it be made vegan. The server knew exactly what needed to be changed to make it vegan: grill the eggplant instead of breaded eggplant, take off the cheese, and no ravioli. But she also noted that the chef would be sure to make the other vegetable selections bigger to make up for the ravioli that I can't eat. So I ended up with grilled eggplant in marinara sauce, grilled squash and peppers, and a quinoa salad that reminded me of tabbouleh. All three were amazing except that the grilled squash and peppers were over salted. I'm sure they would have happily remade it, but it wasn't a big enough problem for me to mention to our server. Though I expected difficulties with my vegan requirements, it was a surprisingly delicious vegan meal!The rest of my family got walleye, catfish, and a seafood pasta. They all raved about their dishes. And to top the meal off, my mom got a complimentary desert for her birthday. Wonderful meal and service!",Jacky W.,,,,,,

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,2009/10/12,"I really like Cameron's it's just in an ""out of the way place"" for me.  I had Sunday dinner here a couple weeks ago with a few of my friends.  The only problem I have with Cameron's is that it's always REALLY loud--I'm not sure why.  The service also tends to be on the slow side...you will wait for drinks here, and wait, and wait, and wait for refills, and wait for more refills...and you will leave with a sore neck from having to turn your head so many times toward the bar to see what's going on.  It's been like this for years, and never fails that each time I go here drinks are slow to come by.  I suggest ordering two at a time.This time around I had the chop-chop salad, that has bacon, eggs, gorgonzola, red onion, and lots of other good stuff.  This is one of my favorite salads, and a good salad for someone like me who hates salad to order.  They give you bread with a whole bulb of roasted garlic for spreading that's a nice touch and something I always look forward to.  If you're a virgin to roasted garlic just squeeze the whole bulb and the cloves pop right out.  Knowing how to do it the right way can really impress a hot date and increases your chances for a happy ending.Next up I had the walleye which is just perfect.  It's fried up in a ritz cracker crust in a shallot cream sauce :-P.  It's usually served with some crab chunks on top, but this time I didn't see any, so I'm not sure if they changed it, ran out of crab or were just being cheap and didn't think I'd notice.  But I notice these things.  One good thing about CM restaurants is that they let you sub out sides---I got rid of the gross broccolini and subbed in collard greens that were delicious, nice and smokey with lots of bacon.For dessert I had the bread pudding--it was good but nothing special.Other good things here:  crab cake appetizer, calamari, goat cheese ravioli, veggie plate, scallops and fried chicken.  Their filet is just so-so to me, so don't get it here.  I'd also stay away from the shrimp and grits--if you've lived in the south or traveled there enough to have real shrimp and grits this will underwhelm you.  And, the carrot cake here is great.That's it, also love the atmosphere.  Worth the money, and for the most part consistent.",Jared E.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,4/30/15,"Gourmet comfort food! We arrived late on a midweek evening, in search of a classy satisfying meal yet unaware of their hours. The service was impeccable! My dear friend and guest for the night is British and felt treated like a queen. She had the flat bread for an appetizer with a glass of red, I had the house bread with a whole bulb of roasted garlic to spread along with butter. For dinner she had shrimp and grits, I had fried catfish with cornbread and fried eggplant. All I can say is delicious!! The night ended beautifully because of our stop here. We had a savory sensory overload that made us slow down to enjoy every bite. Phones were off the table for this stop so no photos to share, it is a must experience for yourself type of dining event. Enjoy!",Tanisha S.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,1/20/16,"Our reservation for two, was for 7:30pm on a Tuesday evening. After being promptly seated we then ended up waiting until 7:55pm before anyone knew we were there. Evidently our waitress just didn't see us because she was busy with a regular's birthday or something. I would have normally let this kind of a start to dinner affect my mood, but once we got ahold of someone it steered back on coarse for a truly exceptional dining experience. Because of our wait, we received our Cucumber Smash cocktails (pineapple vodka, jalapeÌ±o agave, and cucumber+ awesome) and some fried goat cheese risotto balls for free!! Then came the bread...holy crap. They bake it in house and they give you a steamed whole garlic clove to spread on you bread with butter! It's insane. Like ridiculous. The chop and wedge salads were huge and fresh. Our entrees were cooked perfectly and seasoned with a love. I had the best lamb I've ever eaten and their strip with wild mushrooms and onions was to die for. We capped the night with some Irish coffee. Total cost for two, $112.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,12/22/14,"One of the best CM restaurants!! The place was intimate, not superly grand and felt kinda homey and friendly. Somehow, one of the things I loved from my visit was the free yet delicious roasted garlic bread, haha. It was so amazing that I asked for another round. I ordered the oyster and it was kinda creamy and heavy for an appetizer but it was delicious. There were 3 oysters, and I felt one of them was not super fresh, but not making a big deal out of it. It's Ohio anyway, freshness sometimes get sacrificed. I ordered the rack of lamb, it has this crunchiness on the outside that I liked, and the sauce helped to give more flavor, although a little bit too salty for me. It came with this big portion of baked potato, which was nice again, but kinda too heavy and creamy. I was looking for something to clean my palate and lighten it up. For dessert, we ordered the warm chocolate cake, and for me, as long as you have that ice cream and warm gooey cake, I am all satisfied. Overall, a good restaurant, will come back for sure.",Gerry J.,,,,,,

I had to wait for the manager to stop by after the entree to request coffee and dessert menus.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,11/14/14,"So delicious. The roasted garlic with the bread is amazing.We got the calamari and zucchini chips as an appetizer - the zucchini chips were very similar to those at Marcella's (another one of Cameron Mitchell's restaurants) and were delicious.I ordered the shrimp and grits, with no sausage because I am pescatarian. The waitress was very accommodating and the meal came out perfect. Boyfriend ordered the walleye and potato puree. Both of us loved our meals and were stuffed by the end - great portion sizes.The dining room is definitely small, but doesn't feel overcrowded. The meal ended up being a bit more expensive than we usually do, but so worth it. I can't wait to go back!",Ray J.,,,,,,

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,3/14/15,"Wow I'm still going wow...it was that awesome to me and its one of my new places Id like to go to for special occasions or for the whatever about it...I really really liked it...my husband and I went on our date night and we really liked the whole ambiance of the place.  We started out with ordering cocktails, I got a Cosmo and he got the Red Whiskey...very good...our server Rachel, explained to us about their special red and white wine deal but I was in a martini kind of mood.  They delivered some really good warm bread with butter and roasted garlic....um really I love roasted garlic and now you got my attention...I ordered shrimp cocktail as my appetizer and my husband got the oysters bingo...oh yes I love their shrimp soaked in house made horseradish sauce...tingly nose sensations...yay...for our main entrees I got the rack of lamb and my husband got the shrimp and grits...my lamb was medium rare and had English peas, carrots, and pearl onions and a potato gratin...mmmmmmm I was in hog heaven...ok so the Mr.'s must of been good because he never even offered me a taste...um ok what a butthead...anyhow we were too full to partake of any desserts so I can't comment on that but oh yeah we will be back...glad we finally made it in here...we will be back.",Suzanne F.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,3,2007/5/15,"Camerons is a classic. I am going to list a couple negatives first then end on the high note. To write a slam about it being too noisy is pointless. It has always been noisy, will always be noisy. The only reason to mention it is for those who have not been there to alert them. Alert: it is noisy. If you have elderly parents you want to treat to dinner, or want to break up with your significant other, this is not the place because you will not be able to hear each other or have a quiet conversation.Another cautionary note: women dining with other women do not get as good service as when they are accompanied by men. Unfortunately, the servers here perpetuate the myth that women are lousy tippers (interestingly another place where this is true is Ocean Club, another Cameron Mitchell restaurant). They give less than their best service in anticipation, then get less of a tip because of it. Self-fulfilling prophesy. Alert: most of the women I know are professionals with good paying jobs and tip more than the men I know. Unfortunately, I am so continually irked by this in restaurants that I dropped a star off the rating because of it. I feel a bit like a hypocrite for continuing to go in there when in mixed company, but I steer ladies night dinners to other, more gender friendly establishments. Lastly, the bar is always slow at this restaurant. Expect to wait. And wait. And wait for your drink.What's good? You can have what you want to eat prepared the way you want it prepared, and it will always taste amazing. Cameron's just serves great food. And, if you decide to split a meal or any item off the menu, they dress up the presentation in a way that doesn't make you feel like they think you're being cheap. We split meals because we try to manage our portion size. It's very nice not to get an eye roll from the server when we ask. My vote for best menu item is the mushroom gnocchi starter. It is so rich, I don't know if one person could eat a whole portion, but for two it is a decadent taste and textural experience.  I'll be back - just not with the girls.",Kate F.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,2003/6/16,"One of the best restaurants in the CM portfolio.  Dined with my family of four and started with Calamari appetizer - delicious - very tender and cooked to perfection.  Caesar salads all around which were perfectly dressed and not drowning in dressing.  Orders for the table were pasta with shrimp, scallops and mussels; filet mignon; crab cakes; and blackened snapper- all done to perfection.  Arrived at the table piping hot which is a good sign of a well orchestrated kitchen.  Finished the meal with warm servings of carrot cake and rich chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream - absolutely fantastic ending to a great dinner.  This is what I expect from this restaurant and it's one of my 'go to' places in the Columbus area. And can't forget to post that the service was top notch !",Kevin O.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,2,2001/10/15,"I really really REALLY wanted this restaurant to be what i always imagined it to be. Especially with many of the reviews being so positive. Unfortunately, our experience wasn't all that great or anything close to what the reviews were. First of all, we showed up at the restaurant 20 minutes early for our 7:45 reservation, so we thought we'd grab a drink at the bar beforehand while we waited for the rest of our party. The bar was busy, but not out of control. The problem was that the bar staff was so busy serving the food patrons at the bar and couldn't be bothered by the patrons that did not have seats, but would like a drink while they stood and waited. When someone finally decided to make eye contact- we ordered our drinks. The barmaid's demeanor was very ""hurry up, i do not have time to wait for you"" so I went ahead and ordered an easy quick vodka tonic to make it easier on her.  I was disappointed that my drink mixer was flat--yuck.  I let them know this and another barmaid was gracious enough to make me something else. But I had already paid and at this point we were being seated. The second barmaid informed the first of the situation with my drink and i was made to wait 10 extra minutes to adjust the bill rather than just ""let it go"". How much different could the bill have actually been, especially when 4 drinks came up to 39.00- and 2 were domestic beers?? Uh...I think they got enough out of me.  And to add insult to injury- the Cosmopolitan wasn't even good!  Not a great start to the evening or first impression.All in all the dinner experience wash't all that impressive or special. The one thing that actually was was the flatbread appetizer. That was very good. But the Chop Chop salad, and the shrimp and grits were nothing special at all. If you are going to serve shrimp as your main protein- PLEASE do not overcook them. It seemed as though they might have been frozen, fully cooked medium size shrimp that they threw in and cooked to the point of rubbery. Pathetic for what is supposed to be a highly regarded restaurant. My husband had the steak frites and wasn't all that impressed. He reports that although it was cooked well, the flavor/seasoning was lacking. Our guests reported the liked the scallops, catfish, and salmon. In fact, my friend thought the scallops were the best she'd had in Columbus. Which I was happy to hear. All in all, I really wanted this restaurant to be better because I've been wanting to eat here since i moved to Columbus in the 90's. Truthfully, I want so badly to like the Cameron Mitchell chain. Unfortunately, so far, we've been disappointed in all of their ""higher end"" experiences. I guess we'll just save our money and stick with places like Figlio or Moretti's, where they truly care about the quality of the food and experience and not overcharge you for the name.",Stacey L.,,,,,,

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,2007/8/13,"My husband and I had a giftcard so we decided to come here as we had never been.  We sat in the bar for a drink because we arrived early for our 7:00 reservation.  Both bartenders were wonderful and our drinks were very good.  I had a special Elderflower Martini, that was suggested to me.  Delicious.  She asked if we wanted a starter, so we ordered the Crispy Fried Calamari.  The hostess actually came shortly after to tell us our table was ready, and the bartender told us she would bring the starter to our table.  We were seated and the server came a moment later.  She brought us water, and we ordered a bottle of wine.  She (her name was Justina) was very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list.  The bartender brought our starter, which was the best calamari I've ever had.  My husband was going to get a salad, but after Justina named vichyssoise as a special, ordered that.  He really enjoyed it.  I had the shrimp bisque, which was listed as a starter.  It arrived in a large bowl and was enough for a meal.  It really filled me up, so I only took a few bites of my entree, which was Cameron's Walleye (with mashed potatoes and broccolini).   It was just as good reheated the next day.  My husband was very satisfied with the Steak Frites entree.   The dessert menu was very tempting, but we passed, to save a few bucks.We had a nice experience, but for the cost, we will probably venture to other places before we come back.",Anna H.,,,,,,

She was so helpful and pleasant, even brought my husband a pair of reading glasses since we forgot ours.there were special touches along with another surprise that I won't give away. They had a nice wine list and our server Ryan knew the wines well. The goat cheese salad was delectable! My husband ordered the sea bass special which was unbelievably delicious. Absolutely heavenly actually.  I ordered frute' de' mare which is different ever single place I go. It was good. The seafood fresh but the marinara overpowered it.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,2/19/13,"Came here for a quiet birthday dinner last night and I fell in love. I definitely like the ""neighborhood"" feel here that counters being somewhere like the short north or downtown. Parking is no big deal, and the service is as genuine and attentive as ever. It is definitely a lot smaller than I thought, but again, I kind of like that about Cameron's. The hostess was very sweet, checked our coats, and seated us promptly. A full bar is available as you walk in, with the small dining area to the left. You can see some of the chefs cooking and every now and then a big flame will pop up in the back of the room. The food was great - as all Cameron Mitchell restaurants can boast a great menu. After splitting the calamari appetizer, my date and I both devoured our entrees. He got the filet mignon medium rare and I got the salmon. Both were deliciously prepared. The staff is incredibly observant... almost eerily so. We never told anyone it was my boyfriend's birthday, and I didn't even bring him a gift to open. I just gave him a card at the table after dinner. However, the hostess suddenly came over with a pink rose in a little vase and told him happy birthday. And our waitress informed him of a complimentary dessert. He ordered the carrot cake. He loved it. I took a bite, and it was definitely delicious, but almost a little too sweet for me. Overall a really nice experience.",Bee S.,,,,,,

I especially love the roasted garlic they present with the bread. My favorite appetizer is the Crispy Fried Calamari because of the red pepper jam. The Portabella French Fries were interesting and tasty. My favorite dish is the Grilled Fillet Mignon. It's an excellent combination of mashed potatoes, green beans with a red wine sauce garnished with crispy onion rings. The steak itself is seasoned well and cooked perfectly. I've also had a fish dish here that was delicious. Unfortunately, it was a smaller portion than other dishes, and it seems to not be on the menu anymore.This is my go to for special occasions.",Leo S.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,2/18/13,"Cameron's is a great restaurant.  It is a little out of the way in a strip mall next door to a Wendy's, but it's well worth finding it.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance, although we did notice it can get pretty loud in there.  The staff was very friendly and professional throughout our visit.  We were greeted and seated promptly, having made a reservation, and they checked our coats for us.  The meal started off with bread brought to the table.  My husband had the regular offering of honey wheat bread, while I received the gluten free Hawaiian rolls, which were really delightful.  Butter and a whole bulb of roasted garlic accompanied the bread.  The roasted garlic was a very nice touch, and was perfectly cooked to allow it to easily spread on the bread.The menu offers a wide variety of dishes featuring a number of different proteins and preparations - everything from Asian-style dishes like the duck or the salmon to shrimp and grits to scallops, lamb, and filets.  My husband had the Caesar Salad and the Heritage Farm Pork Chop.  He reported that the meat was tender and juicy and enjoyed the accompanying red skin potatoes and roasted veggies.  I found that the gluten-free menu was very generous - I had multiple dishes from which to choose, but finally settled on the Ponzu Salmon.  The salmon was delicious and came with sticky rice and stir fried veggies, all over a flavorful citrus sauce.  The chefs were very accommodating as, in addition to requesting the gluten free preparation, I asked for the salmon to be prepared well instead of their usual medium.  It came out perfectly.  Portion size was good - we both brought home leftover containers.The dessert and coffee menu had a nice variety, and offered two gluten free options, including what the server told us was the restaurant's signature dessert, the Meyer Lemon Gratin, which we decided to split.  The gratin has the texture of a cheesecake and comes with a lovely lemon cream and fresh raspberries.  It was a really fantastic dessert, very fluffy and delicious.  I don't usually order dessert, but I would definitely have this one again!",Marissa C.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,3,2/17/11,"Location is in a strip mall but the restaurant inside is nice.Service wasn't bad just not great, we poured our own wine, I'd put it up there with a Denny's.  They could do with sprucing up the staff, and certainly the staff look like the overly enjoy their food, and their outfits if this is fine dining need to reflect that.  Kind of an interesting night, although the restaurant was busy it did not have any atmosphere, felt like there was no one present.Wine list is limited but passable, I don't remember seeing a bottle above $100 which is not an issue but the quality was very mid-range.  No major stand-outs either in quality or in price on the list.For appetizers we ordered the calamari and the lobster perogies.  Calamari and its sauce was king of blah.  The perogies were buried under a small mound of vegetables, again not memorable and really lacking any distinct taste.  The entrees - the lamb two of us ordered, one well done and the other medium rare looked the same - again just okay.  The standout for us was the brownie, we asked them to remove all the crap they had with it - ice cream etc. and just serve it with fresh fruit.  Having the dessert as we ordered with our wine choice was a great call.For what we got and the price you pay I can't imagine rushing back.",Des D.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,3,2005/2/12,"Ate here last night and it was ok.  I had a glass of the Syrah-Shriaz blend but it came in a rather smallish glass, a white wine glass, not a larger red wine glass, so that was a bit off putting, but that's fine.  The lobster perogies for appetizer were appealing, although I thought it wasnt rich/creamy enough, but perhaps that is my personal taste.  There wasnt that much lobster, but was decent. The warm bread with roasted garlic and whipped butter was nice, but if you're going to give roasted garlic, you have to give olive oil and balsamic vinegar, right?!  oh well.  Entree was the short rib beef stroganoff, where the beef was nice and tender, but wasn't cut to suit a human mouth, so i had to do some cutting.  The noodles were good, but definitely overcooked and not al dente.  I did, however, enjoy the different tastes with each fork full as the garlic, mushroom, and spinach definitely changed the taste with each bite to keep things interesting.Dessert was their special of the day, something about a raspberry ice cream with white chocolate and candied pecans.  That was good, but the whipped cream was not sweet enough for me.Overall, a good experience, definitely a good value as the prices are relatively lower than what I would have expected for the attention to plating, ambience, and general target consumer they are going for.  For the price, you're getting good value, but if they paid attention to a bit more detail in the food, I think it could be spectacular.",Moses S.,,,,,,

The staff here is wonderful and I always feel like lingering a bit longer with my dinner companion when I'm here.The specials have never been that ""special"" but I've developed favorites from the menu so I'm never feel like I'm missing out. I'd like to see some additional vegetable dishes that are more interesting than the standard sides.The bar, although crowded at times, is cozy and friendly.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,2002/10/14,"We were there for the ""grand re-opening."" The restaurant is lively, meaning noisy for us. The interior decorating, by contrast, is neutral, or bland. The food however was another story. I had steak which I don't ordinarily eat out except at steak houses. The meat was of exceptional quality, and was actually cooked, as ordered, medium rare. I don't recall the sides served, but I do recall enjoying them. We shared the chopped salad, which they split onto separate plates. The salad was good, but not entirely ""chopped.""

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,2007/4/11,"I've had mixed results with Cameron Mitchell's places.  On one hand, M is my favorite restaurant in town, and the default choice for special occasions.  On the other hand, I'm not a fan of Cap City, and some of the other places like Molly Woo's and Marcella's have been good but didn't blow me away.Cameron's now joins M on my list of favorite places in town.  I really like its low-key location (not downtown or in a mall like his other restaurants), and the small interior has modern decor.  The food was the star of the show, however.  I started with a delicious spinach salad with candied pecans, orange basil dressing and ""goat cheese mousse"" (a reviewer commented on the number of dishes that contain goat cheese, but I don't see how that could possibly be bad).  My wife, who had a different salad, and I both agreed they were two of the best salads we'd ever had.My entree was an Asian-inspired salmon with a butter-sriracha sauce, ginger-glazed carrots and snap peas, and pineapple rice.  Perfectly cooked and mouth-wateringly good.  I was somewhat disappointed that the sriracha wasn't more prevalent in the sauce, but I had no complaints.  My wife got the scallops, which were nicely presented with truffle chips and mashed potatoes.  A connoisseur of scallops, my wife declared the dish to be the best restaurant meal she'd ever eaten!For dessert, I tried the meyer lemon gratin.  I didn't make the ""gratin = cheese"" connection until I tasted it, so it wasn't what I was expecting, but it was delicious... a tangy lemon cheesecake with a cottage-cheese-like texture, loaded with lemon zest and caramelized on top, served with a thin cinnamon cookie with hazelnuts.  Scrumptious.  My wife had the peanut butter chocolate pot de creme, which tasted like a rich Reese's pudding.  Neither of us could finish the rich desserts after the huge and filling entrees.Extra star for the excellent service.  Our server Rachel took great care of us, and the restaurant gave my wife the dessert of her choice free on her birthday, plus a single rose in a vase.  Very nice touch.We'll return to this excellent neighborhood restaurant.",Dennis L.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,2,5/28/11,"In the interest of full disclosure I'll say that I have sort of a love hate relationship with Cameron Mitchell Restaurants. On the one hand I love some of the things Cameron Mitchell has done for the Columbus Culinary Community and often times they have some great food. On the other hand, even for a small corporate chain, they sometimes can be a bit too ""chain restauranty"" for me in the bad sense. Not that I have anything against corporate restaurants (I work for a very corporate place myself), it's just there are certain things that often happen with chain restaurants (especially fine dining) that I don't necessarily like. Rambling aside I won't don't hold that against them for purposes of reviews as my review of one of their other places will attest.If theres one thing I've come to expect consistently from different Cameron Mitchell Restaurants it's awesome customer service. This was probably the only time I've ever been to one and not experienced that. From the start things weren't good. The hostess was visibly distracted when we came in. I could accept a hostess at a casual place doing her homework at the hostess stand, but when part of what you're paying for is a dining experience I don't think you should have to wait for the hostess to put down her latest reading assignment to get sat. From there our server seemed to have better things to do than check on her tables (all two of them). I'm not demanding when it comes to service, but I was a little irritated at how long we had to wait for her to come back just to see if we were ready to order. She was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu though.Speaking of the menu, I did get a chuckle out of the fact that goat cheese was used on eight or nine different menu items, if my memory serves me correctly. I'm a big fan of chevre, but geez man was there a sale? My wife and I ended up splitting the lobster pierogies to start, then I had the duck and she had the short rib stroganoff.  I really love a well executed duck breast and it's not something you can get anywhere you go, so I was really looking forward to my dinner.All of the dishes were presented very beautifully. The pierogies were very good, a perfect portion to share just to get your appetite going. The entrees though pretty on the plate, left a lot to be desired on the pallet. The duck was cooked to the temperature as I had asked, but it was pretty clear that the cook barely seared it if at all before tossing it into the oven. There was hardly any crispiness to the skin at all, it was very chewy. The fried rice was more like sticky rice and the orange sauce was bland to put it nicely. The only thing really right about the dish was the baby bok choy was perfectly cooked. My wife enjoyed the stroganoff although she said and I tasted and confirmed that the beef was a bit chewy for braised short rib.As a result of not being overly impressed with our meals we had plenty of room to give dessert a try. I am a fan of all things lemon and creamy so I had to try the meyer lemon gratin. While I'd like to nit pick the fact that they call it a gratin and there was no sort of nicely browned crust on top of it, I can't. Sadly the dish, while basically just a dome shaped lemon cheesecake was far to delicious for me to get too hung up on proper nomenclature. After dessert we got the check. The check was what you'd expect for a dinner for two with one drink each, a shared app and dessert at a nice fine dining restaurant. Problem was the food and service just weren't up to that level. It was a slow weeknight, but that still no reason to slack off. Food should be coming out perfect on a slow night and the only service complaints should be things like ""my server was so bored they wouldn't leave us alone"" not ""my server can't be found"" or ""why is the sous chef standing at the FOH side of the pass reading something while trying to coax a drop of gatorade out of his frozen bottle"" (yes that happened)All these things added up to a very disappointing experience.",Kevin R.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,6/29/15,"We've wanted to try this restaurant for a while and finally got the opportunity. Let me begin by saying that the service was excellent and friendly. The decor is nicer on the inside than the outside and setting would imply. I had the grape gimlet, and we both started with the shrimp bisque. The bisque had a rich, almost roasted flavor and was very creamy. We also enjoyed the bread, butter, and roasted garlic. The pace of the meal was perfect -- I was never left wondering where the next item was or left feeling rushed. For entrees, I got the teriyaki salmon. The salmon was perfectly cooked. However, there was too much sauce for my taste. It was difficult to get a bite of food that wasn't swimming in sauce because they put a pool of it on the bottom of the plate. The sauce was strong enough that I would've preferred a bit less of it. My husband got the pork chop and clams. The pork chop was very thick and was perfectly seared. The mashed potatoes and pan jus were delicious. Finally, for dessert we shared the Meyer lemon gratin. This is a unique dessert composed of a cylinder of lemony cream that's been bruleed on top, with a lacy hazelnut cookie and berries and lemon sauce decorating the plate. This was very pretty and well prepared. The lemon cream was a bit too cheesecakey for our taste, but if you like cheesecake and/or lemon, you'll love it. The restaurant itself is not quiet, but not to the point where I had to yell at my husband to be heard. I definitely needed to sit right next to him rather than across the table from him. They fit lots of tables into this restaurant for the size of it, which is fine. Overall, this is a solidly good restaurant with a menu that has something for everyone, and everything was well-prepared, and the service was great. I hope to have the opportunity to go back sometime and try some other dishes on the menu.",Elaine W.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,6/14/15,"My husband and I rarely make it out for dinner, but to celebrate our 44th and 43rd birthdays and his parents' 47th wedding anniversary, we chose to revisit the restaurant we visited on our 1st wedding anniversary 17 years ago.  I was a little nervous when I called to make reservations and was told we had our pick of times.  Does that mean it's no longer a great place to go for a good meal???  Also a little nervous to be the 1st and only table for about 10 minutes.  But the quaint restaurant filled up shortly thereafter and we proceeded to have one of the best meals we've had in years!  We had the flatbread, filet mignon, walleye, short ribs, salmon special, warm carrot cake, and lemon gratin.  And EVERY bite was delicious!  Wine Down Sunday also afforded us two half price bottles of Cab that were wonderful!  The service was also great, but I mostly appreciated the sheer quality of excellent, flavorful food!

The hostess was very polite and friendly, and sat us promptly at a nice booth.  I like the atmosphere and ambiance here, soft lighting and not too noisy.  Our waiter AJ was outstanding.  My wife ordered a vanilla sidecar and we started with the calamari, which were cooked perfectly.  I had the short ribs and my wife had the scallops.  Both meals were presented well and delicious.  We had the carrot cake for dessert and it's probably the best we've had.  The manager also came to our table to check on us.

The restaurant is quite small, so expect to wait. We sat while awaiting our table and ordered an appetizer and drinks. The lobster perogies were a bit pricy, but good.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,4/20/14,We went for a birthday dinner on Easter and found that there was only a buffet option because it was Easter.  It turned out that we were VERY lucky that this was when we went. It was wonderful. The service was attentive but not hovering   The food on the buffer was very good and certainly not the usual buffet food. All items were from their menu. It was fun to try things we might not have tried otherwise. They also had small plates of other options from their menu. These were great too. We will be back for sure.,Evan R.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,8/25/10,"First, get the goat cheese beignets. Don't ask questions, just do it.This is the most ""genuine"" of the Cameron Mitchell restaurants-- a neighborhood vibe, intimate, and out-of-the-way. Eating here feels like you know a special secret. For us, it's where we eat when we don't know where we want to eat, but we know we want something fresh and full of flavor. I had the Blackened Alaskan Halibut, and it was seasoned perfectly. Soft and flaky inside, with a little spicy crunch on the outside. Good portion size, creative but not over-the-top sides (succotash and andouille hash).Great place to go on a weeknight with the parents or in-laws.",Catherine J.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,2009/6/11,"The service was enthusiastic to say the least. Our server was quite attentive, a bit comically so at times. :)The first taste to arrive was the bread. Beautiful, hot from the oven, perfect texture, served with roasted garlic and butter, it was hard not to eat too much of it.For appetizers we had portabella fries and lobster pierogies, both of which were lovely in presentation. The pierogies were a really interesting tasty dish, but the mushroom ""fries"" were not that exciting and became soggy quickly.My companions ordered salads (the spinach and the goat cheese) that were lovely and fresh. the ingredients seemed well chosen. For entree I had the fried chicken which was heavenly! the boneless meat (breast and thigh I think) was perfectly cooked, the batter was perfectly crisped, and the accompanying potatoes and slaw were wonderful complements. Dessert was the evening special: apple pie with cinnamon ice cream and it was so delicious I forgot to notice until later that the ice cream was not very strongly cinnamon flavored.I think this is a great place to take out of town guests when a drive to the city is not in the cards.",Virginia B.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,8/31/13,"Excellent service, nice wine, scotch and port list, Food flavorful and well presented. My pork chop was just perfect,.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,8/23/10,"The wife and I had a great date night here.  Cameron's is different than most of the other Cameron Mitchel restaurants around town in that it's clientele is a little more...residential?  It just has this vibe like it's the place that the people that live around it come to as their go-to dinner.  It's also an older, quieter crowd.  Compared to Cap City or his places at Easton or the Short North, this one is slower, more mature.  If Cap City is a Toyota, and M is a Mercedez, then Cameron's is a Buick.Anyway...Saturday night date with the wife.  We looked online at the Cameron Mitchel restaurants' website.  Initially, we were going to go to Marcella's or Martini's in the Short North.  The waiting times for tables was past 10PM, according to the online reservation form.  Cameron's could seat us at 8:30PM (it was 7:45PM when we looked).  We passed up the online form and went directly there.  We had a 20 min. wait at the bar (I don't know why we didn't just take the online reservation).  At the bar, the service was super.Once seated in the full (but not uncomfortably crowded) dining room, we asked for a starter dish of lobster pierogies.  They were awesome!  There were only 3 pierogies (for $10, I wouldn't mind one or two more) but they were buried in this...lobster gravy-salad?  It had diced asparagus, corn, and lobster bits.  Hit the spot.  If you get it, don't let the server take the plate until they've brought you bread.  The gravy makes a bitchin' dipping sauce.I didn't initially order a salad, but the server did a very sly ""and a chopped salad for you, too"" after my wife ordered her's.  It was very good, just the right dressing.  Better was the bread.  It comes with a whipped butter and a whole head of roasted garlic.  Somehow Cameron knew my wife's weak spot.For entrees the wife had the shrimp pasta and I had the duck.  I've never had duck.  I'm not sure how to put this, but there needs to be a word for something that's technically good...well prepared... but that you still don't like.  If there's a word for it, that was my experience with the duck.  It comes with a rice-based Asian preparation.  It tasted like very good Chinese take out (lots of peanuts, allergy people!).One bite into the meat, I said to my wife, ""You know, this is well made, but I think I just don't like duck.""  It's very much like dark-meat turkey.  You either have to like or you don't.  Still, I finished the whole dish.Also on the list of things that were good, but of a different taste than my own was the server.  She was super polite and very professional.  Absolutely nothing wrong with her or the job she did.  I'm just not a...""happy"" person.  She was almost a little too nice for my liking.  Just little things, like how they don't just ask, ""Do you want your beer in a glass?"" but instead it's, ""May I pour your beer into a glass?""  I'm sure she's excellent according to the restaurant's requirements for customer service, but every now and then, I just want to see a little bit of the person's personality come through.Very good experience.  Highly recommended.***Update*** I just read the other reviews and it looks like several others have had virtually identical visits: awesome pierories, bubbly servers...  One note I want to echo: if you do get the duck (in any one of apparently several preparations over the past few reviews, definitely ask for a steak knife.",Gabriel M.,,,,,,

The waited was very attentive and professional. The only thing I had in mind was good food. The appetizer, calamari and a flat bread dish, was alright. The calamari had honey drizzled at the bottom. It was a new thing for me to eat calamari with honey, and the result was that it is a good pairing! My dinner was the duck with fried rice and orange reduction for the sauce. The meal was very chinese influenced. The fried rice was way TOO greasy. The meal was alright. My other party got all the different entrees, and I could see that the presentation is very well done. However, the taste is kind of ""safe and bland"".The dessert were the strawberry shortcake and the bread pudding. It was mediocre. Nothing to cream about.Enough said, it was a very pleasant environment to bring old folks because of their ""safe"" palates.

He said he wanted American food, so we thought this would be something different. Cameron's is tucked back in Worthington, so I never would have ventured there had I not found it on Yelp!It's a great meal! It's definitely a splurge meal- both for your diet and your wallet, but it's worth it.We started with the goat cheese beignets, portabella ""french fries"" and shrimp bisque soup. All awesome! The goat cheese beignets were lightly fried with a marinara sauce, the portabella fries are mushrooms in a french fry fashion and the shrimp bisque is rich, decadent and enough to share.My husband had the filet, I had the steak frites, my bro-in-law had the shrimp and grits and his gf got the moscovy duck.  The steaks were cooked well. I really liked the vegetables that came under my steak and the fries. My husband's mashed potatoes and bro-in-law's goat cheese grits were also tasty. The gf liked her duck.For dessert, we shared the warm chocolate cake and the New Orleans bread pudding.

Fortunately, or waitress picked up on the disappointment and complied with our request for more sauce for the fish, along with making the meal complimentary.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,3,1/21/10,"Decided to try Cameron's for restaurant week with a group last night, we started out with seven but as our reservation came up we were five.  Sadly, that meant they had saved us the large round table in the middle of the entire restaurant.  I won't deny that I was a bit shocked at the size, having gone to other Cameron Mitchell restaurants this was almost half the seating room (it was his first restaurant so maybe he wasn't so ambitious at the time?).We all selected a fixed-price meal from the menu.  I had the chop-chop salad, the hoisin glazed salmon, and the warm chocolate cake.  The chop-chop salad was nothing to write home about, just your typical salad loaded with an array of toppings (asparagus, hard boiled eggs, gorgonzola, etc.).  As for the salmon, it was absolutely delicious, it came with a side of snap peas, carrots, and pineapple infused rice.  I devoured the thing.  My friends tried the herb roasted chicken and one found it to be a bit dry, although the mashed potatoes were fantastic.  And another tried the pork chop and said that it was amazing.Then came dessert.  I must say I am a dessert junkie, especially when it comes to chocolate cake.  I'm used to Cameron's java lava cup at the fish market (which they were kind enough to take off the menu...).  Needless to say I expected great things from their warm chocolate cake.  The menu highlighted that it came with a scoop of Johnson's vanilla ice cream and white chocolate whipped cream.  When it came out it was plated beautifully...  Then I tried it, not exactly what I had hoped for.  It was good, don't get me wrong, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  My girlfriends enjoyed it, but they agreed that it wasn't as sweet and rich as it should have been.For the $25 a meal asking price I wasn't completely satisfied.  The actual menu is limited so I'm not sure if I'll be returning, I think I'll stick to the fish market for now.",Michelle K.,,,,,,

The steaks seemed to be good but not great.  We didn't have room for dessert there but got the apple crisp to go.

Nearly every former and current CMR employee (myself included) will tell you that this gem is one of, if not their favorite Cameron Mitchell restaurant. It's a small, cozy restaurant that doesn't look like much from the outside (surrounded by a gas station and a Wendy's I believe?), but when you walk in, you are pleasantly surprised. The food and service have always been outstanding here - I think they have some of the best servers - many of them have served at Cameron's for years, or have worked at other CMR restaurants. Never had a bad meal here, that's for sure. So, if you are wanting a nice evening out, something different from the norm, stop in Cameron's. You'll be glad you did.",John W.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,9/26/09,"My wife and I had dinner there last night.  We'd only been there once before and that was maybe 7 or 8 years ago. My only recollection from the previous trip was that it was well-done, but so over-the-top eclectic that I couldn't find anything normal that I wanted to eat--a little too foo-foo, if you know what I mean. Granted, this memory is coming from fuzzy brain cells.Flash forward to 2009 and we checked out the menu online and noted that everything looked yummy so we called in to a very nice woman to reserve a table for two.  She asked if there was a special occasion we were celebrating, and all I could think of was, ""It's Friday night!""  But that was a nice touch for her to ask.We were greeted by a trio of smiling faces and quickly had our table in a very busy restaurant.  It appeared that the place had been redecorated since our previous experience, so I'm guessing they made some changes several years ago.  Or else I can't remember ...My wife had a glass of wine while I ordered a double Glenlivet.  I received an ample pour of golden liquid--perrrfect.  (I can't tell you how many times I've ordered Glenlivet on the rocks at other restaurants and it comes out a much lighter color than it should be--meaning they water down their booze (grrr!))We decided to split a spinach salad that came out just right, albeit a small serving for each since we'd split it.  But that's okay--we didn't want that much.My wife ordered the shrimp & grits and loved it.  I was jonesing for some beef, so I ordered the steak frites which came out a perfect medium as ordered.  It was a slightly smaller strip and came with a small amount of vegetables, mostly asparagus, and the frites (aka french fries) standing up decoratively. The steak was very, very good; not quite as good as a Ruth's Chris, but I'm not going to ding them on it one bit.On to dessert.  My wife ordered the bread pudding and some decaf coffee and just loved it.  I ordered the meyer lemon gratin, which is basically a tangy lemon cheesecake with some raspberries around it and a decorative hazlenut cookie that looks more like a flat piece of melted sugar that's hardened up (and tastes yummy).  Thumbs up all around on the desserts--they were terrific, even though we didn't need them and that we ended up feeling stuffed.In the end, all of the food was terrific.Service was stellar.  When we asked about the decor which seemed new to us, our waitress explained that she'd worked there something like 6 or 7 years (there's a clue of goodness for you).  She came by at the exact right intervals, was genuinely cheery (which is contagious!) and efficiently took great care of us.  I tipped her at the 20% level.I guess my old preconceptions needed to be replaced. This is a nice choice and one that we'll begin coming back to.  It's on the pricey end, and would make a great place to celebrate an event.  I was going to say it probably isn't the kind of place to bring kids (we saw none there), but they do have a kids menu.",Tom P.,,,,,,

It sits in a small strip center in Linworth and offers the quiet ambiance I expect of a nice neighborhood joint.  The layout, lighting, and restrooms all get a thumbs up.  It is restaurant week in Columbus and they had a nice menu.   For starters, I tried a crabcake and the chopped salad both were excelent.  The main course was a pork chop, which was cooked perfectly.  The sauce was almost too simple, though good.  For dessert, I chose the carrot cake, which was fantastic.  Warm and rich and velvety good.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,2,5/19/08,"A glaring eyesore in Cameron Mitchell's list of restaurants, Cameron's American Bistro offers ordinary fare like the herb roasted chicken and pork chops. Twin and I must have picked a bad night to try out CAB as we were there along with a party of twenty. Needless to say service was extremely slow--10 minutes for beverages, another 20 for bread that was still baking, and an additional 40 for our dishes to arrive at our table. Our server looked exhausted and the restaurant had just opened an hour ago!Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I settled with the bistro vegetarian plate because it sounded really good on the menu. Twin ordered the roasted chicken rigatoni. Both dishes weren't atrocious, but they weren't exactly stellar either. The pesto sauce on my plate had enough flavor, but it was simply lacking in amount. While the top layers were crispy and warm, I noticed that the bottom half layer were anything but warm. Twin's chicken, however, was a tad dry making the rest of the dish less than enjoyable. Having been to all of the other Cameron Mitchell restaurants (minus Marcella's), I was expecting the same type of quality and service. But, alas, neither could be found at CAB.The dessert menu didn't look entirely enticing either. I mean, strawberry cheesecake and chocolate covered peanut butter pie?! Creativity was clearly not key at CAB. Twin and I were already placing bets as we were finishing up our meal as to how long it would take for the server to bring us our check. 25 minutes, so it was closer to my 30-minute time frame than twin's 15-minute.CAB is definitely pricey for the quality that you get, and service is not up to par.

Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,3,12/13/08,"Last night, Greg and I went on our 'free' date. We took a bunch of those gift cards that we've had laying around the house forever and finally did something with them. The night started with dinner at Cameron's American Bistro. This is one Cameron Mitchell Restaurant that neither of us had ever been to.Really awkward location in a mini strip mall. Parking was easy, though the lot was small. We were overly greeted by not one, but four people at the hostess station. We had made reservations, so getting seated was no problem. We snagged a snug corner booth that was very comfortable. The tables were close, not awkwardly so but close enough that you could spy on what your neighbors were having for dinner.The interior was nice and warm with an autumnal color scheme and fresh lilies everywhere. Up front was an expansive view of the kitchen. The kitchen lit up the dining room several times that night with fire flares.We started with drinks. I got a Hot Buttered Rum that was amazing. Greg got the Sam Adams Winter Lager (only two draft beer selections the other being Columbus Pale Ale). Greg's beer came in a glass shaped like a rocket. The size of the glass proved dysfunctional when Greg had to tip his head at a neck-breaking angle to get the last few gulps out of the bottom. I recommend they switch to a run-of-the-mill Pilsner.I got the calamari. Greg is weird about food, so I had the appetizer all to myself. It was very good, served atop honey with a chunky horseradish dipping sauce and two spears of lightly Panko crusted zucchini. The calamari itself wasn't the best I've ever had (as that honor goes to sister restaurant Martini), still, it was very good.The complimentary bread was a crusty sourdough that was soft on the inside. It was served with butter and a whole head of roasted garlic. The bread was okay. It did leave little hard remnants on the caps of my teeth.Greg got a salad -  Casaer no anchovies, as always. The salad was wimpy. The lettuce was limp, and the croutons had to have been store bought. I like my croutons soggy; I let them soak up the dressing. Greg likes his crispy. These croutons were neither. They were just stale and funny tasting, and they left a bad taste in my mouth.For our main course, I got the Roasted Indiana Duck, and Greg got the Herb Roasted Chicken. I had never had duck before. This was all dark meat and very crispy skin. It had a nice fatty quality and was good and moist. The two legs were served on top a sweet chili glaze. I really liked the glaze for the first few bites, but it wasn't long before the sweetness became too much - it was on every bite. The duck came with roasted veggies (carrots, zucchini, squash, and mushrooms) that were cooked perfectly. I also got a side of mashed potatoes, again with the horseradish flavor - very nice. Greg's chicken was well-seasoned with a lemon-pepper mix. It was topped with a red wine vinegar (not noted on the menu). Greg hates vinegar, so that was a bit of a letdown. Both bird were served on the bone (well, with one bone sticking out of each hunk of meat); the bones made it a little awkward to eat. Also, the waiter gave Greg a steak knife, but I had to make do with a butter knife - not sure what that was all about.No desserts for us. I was so stuffed that I had to have half of my meal boxed.Throughout the night, our waiter was very attendant - too attendant. He started to annoy me. Every time he went past, he would check in on us. I could barely talk to Greg. The waiter was definitely too by-the-book. He didn't come off as friendly, rather as a bit haughty...but not quite. It's hard to explain, but he didn't make me feel comfortable.I did sneak to the bathroom before the entrees came. It was one of the strangest bathrooms I've ever been in. Two stalls. It looked like a very clean version of a Wendy's bathroom, but it had a nice floating sink and all the ladies products found in an upscale bathroom (mouthwash, hairspray, lotion, toothpicks, etc.) I always appreciate when they put those special products out for us. To get to the bathroom, you have to snake back through the narrow bar area. I think they need to rework that layout because it was almost impossible to squeeze through that crammed passageway.Overall a nice night, but I don't think I was impressed enough to return.",Morgan D.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,3,2003/9/11,"Like some other reviews found the food good overall, but certainly not great. We started with the lobster porgies, which were probably the highlight of the night. I would get them again. I had the Steak Frites and my lady had the scallops. I ordered Med-rare...it was Medium at best, not a deal breaker but I have had equally good steaks (maybe even a little better) at Texas Roadhouse for about $10 less. It was pretty tough and cooking it to Medium certainly didn't help. We both thought the scallops were a little undercooked. I like a nicely seared crust on my scallops and the ones we were served were barely browned and a little mushy in the middle. For the price you pay here i thought the food should be...well...better. i may return again but i would get something else on the menu.",Mike H.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,8/16/09,I went here last night for dinner and had a really great meal.  I started with the lobster peirogies.  These had lobster inside and a corn emulsion outside.  Very good!  Then I had the chop chop salad.  It was great also.  For my main course I had the duck breast.  It was covered with a honey chili glaze and came with cabbage-horseradish mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.  I looked at the dessert menu but was too full.,Paul F.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,1/18/11,"Food was great!  Service was good. I had the orange blossom cocktail and it was delicious!  Caesar salad was just whatever and a little overdressed. But pretty good. The shrimp and grits were delicious and I ate every bite. My boyfriend had shrimp bisque, which was outstanding; and the black and blue tilapia. Pretty good. I really expected the chocolate cake to be tastier. Service was attentive, even the manager asked me if I needed anything. Honestly didn't notice any music, but thought the restaurant looked nice with all the candles lit. We had a great experience, and would definitely come back!",Patty R.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,2,2001/1/11,"I'm always hoping to find a good restaurant close to my house.  There are precious few in our part of town.  My husband and I finally broke down and tried Cameron's.  It's close to home, but is also a Cameron Mitchell joint, and we avoid his restaurants.The positive?  The service was really good.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  The food was delicious.  I ordered the cod and my husband ordered the salmon.  My dish was really rich and decedent.  I could only eat half of it.  But I enjoyed every bite.  Husband ate every bite of his, so I'll assume he liked it.Why only 2 stars?  The atmosphere wasn't what I was expecting.  Specifically the music.  They play a generic mix of soft pop tunes, and they play it rather loudly.  I felt as though I was in the mall or a horrid cheap chain restaurant.  When I spend $100 on dinner, ideally I'd like live jazz.  If not, a sophisticated mix of jazz or house music is great too.  Shania Twain is unacceptable.  It ruined the entire evening for us.We won't be going back.",Betsy R.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,5,2010/3/11,"My wife and I were in Columbus for the CU/OSU football game...a bad day for CU. However, we found Cameron's, a great day for us. After the game we were driving to the hotel and spotted Cameron's in a strip mall on Hwy 161. What an outstanding establishment! While sitting at the bar, waiting for our table I ordered a scotch on the rocks, specifically ""Famous Grouse"". To my surprise it was their well scotch. So often, restaurants serve crappy liquor in their well drinks. Having FG in the well was a great start, the appetizers were excellent, the main course, seasonal Walleye and the vegetable medley dinner, were outstanding. We ended up eating at the bar  because the bartender/server was one of the best we've ever had. If you go to Cameron's be sure and ask for Roberta, she will make sure your meal is fantastic. We came back two nights later, had another outstanding meal, wanted Roberta for our server, but it was her night off. Happily we still rec'd excellent service at the bar and the dining room. Cameron's American Bistro is off the beaten path but absolutely worth the drive. You will send me a thank you on Yelp if you follow this recommendation and have dinner at Cameron's. My wife said as we left Cameron's for the second time, ""if we lived here, this is the only restaurant we would patronize!""",Robert H.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,4,7/23/10,"Oh long hail the Restaurant Week!!!!  Yes, I went to Cameron's on the week that the event was going on~  It was my first time and definitly won't be my last time.  It was yum!  I WANTED to start it off with Crab Bisque, but they *drum rolling* ran out.  So I had the other appetizer, which was Goat Cheese stuffed with Riocotta and house salad.  The goat cheese didn't fly too well with me; I think it's a hit or miss kinda thing... well, it missed with me.  The salad was great, it was like work of art~  Beautiful greens all very crisp and fresh, sprinkled with carrots and red cabbage, decorated with dried cranberries, all tossed in this sweet-tart vinegarette dressing!  It was yummy!!  For the main entree, had a hoisen glazed salmon with steamed and seasoned vegetables.  OMG, it was delish!!!  The salmon was perfectly grilled with just enough hoisen flavoring and it flaked right off and melted in my mouth.. *drool*... I'd order it again, it was really savory!!  Now for the dessert!  Keep in mind that I have a massive sweet tooth and I NEVER leave without my dessert unfinish! Now since we have that unstanding, I LEFT WITHOUT FINISHING THE DESSERT.  Ok, let me adjust that a tad: I left without finishing all of the dessert; I had two: Cream Bulee with lots of berries for garnish and a Warm Chocolate Cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Needless to say, I finished the chocolate cake~ As for Cream Bulee, it's not that I didn't want to finish it, it was that I COULDN'T.  Cream bulee was not done, not baked through, not finish, you get my drift.  Flavor was good, it just didn't set just yet - too watery *cry*  Overall, my experience with Cameron's American Bistro was memorable.  Service was good, food was excellent, and the tab didn't break my bank!  I would've given 5 stars if the Cream Bulee was consumable.... Otherwise, two thumbs up from me :)",Sophia L.,,,,,,
Cameron's American Bistro,121,4,2,1/29/11,I'm sure the food is great but we never had a chance to try it. We made resvations but when we got there we were told they were running 15-20 minutes behind. We considered waiting but the entire entry way was filled with others waiting. From their comments it seemed they had been waiting longer than 15 or 20 minutes. The restaurant could have offered drinks while we were waiting but honestly didn't even apologize.,Dorothy B.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,9/18/17,"Really enjoyed it. The service was attentive, efficient and friendly. The food selection was varied, interesting and appealing. You can also sit at the bar and have appetizers and a drink. I like what they are doing here and I hope to be back.The appetizers were delicious. The main course sizes are enormous and very well prepared. One of the favorites was the Pasta Bolognese made with shredded beef. It was a delicious and filling dish. The desserts were very large and delicious as well.My quibble is with the steaks. They are good- not great. It is not a problem though as there are so many other excellent choices on the menu.",Edward F.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2009/2/17,"I rarely am blown away by a restaurant but tonight the chef came out and brought my steak out after they mixed my order up. I have very clear instructions when I order a steak butterflied medium well no pink but not burnt. My first steak came out rare! But it was immediately corrected and all the food was Delicious! If you have a chance to go order anything with tomatoes because they were phenomenal. The mashed potatoes w chives were also pretty good. All the food was good! I cleared my plate and I rarely do this!!! Must go place in cbus for a great dinner hands down. Lastly, Cameron was our waiter and he was also excellent!",Janelle S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2008/1/17,"I made a reservation online & apparently counted wrong because the reservation was 2 people short when we arrived. At first they told us it would be a 2 hour wait because  of our mistake and I almost had a slight meltdown. The manager was able to save the day and rearrange some things to make sure we weren't out in the cold with 2 kids.We started with the chicken meatballs and they were delicious. I think it came with 3-4 for sharing. We also had the charcuterie which came with a hard to forget blue cheese.First course of the restaurant week menu was the king kong roll. I was skeptical of sushi but you get quite a few pieces and it tasted fresh. BF started with the corn chowder and it tasted great, was savory and properly seasoned. Main entree I had the rigatoni short rib which came with an abundance of meat and a hefty portion. If I wanted pasta I would get this again.I will definitely come back to Hudson 29 - not only for the food but for the outstanding staff who went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience",Rachael H.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2001/3/18,"Huuuuge fan. Great food, staff is phenomenal. I could stay for hours, so comfortable and upscale without being pretentious.

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2001/8/18,Great food experience and very attentive and knowledgeable staff! We went here over the holidays as we were visiting from San Francisco.

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2011/5/17,"Great food, wine choices and atmosphere, this place was highly recommended by a number of people. Only four stars on Yelp but deserved five in my opinion. We started off with the cheese roll appetizer, along with the wine country board. Both were delicious along with a couple glasses of red wine. Their wine selection was very good, especially by the glass. We sampled the Black Stallion Cabernet, the Trefethen red, and a Spanish Tempranillo. We ordered various entrÌ©es, cheeseburger, flatbread, sushi, salmon, rigatoni Bolognese. I tasted almost every entrÌ©e and they were all fantastic, everyone commented how amazing everything was. The salmon and the rigatoni were especially wonderful. We will definitely go back!",George N.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,7/27/17,"We came here with family on a Saturday night for dinner. My sister in law made reservations a couple weeks in advance but we ended up with two additional people. The manager did a fantastic job getting our expanded party into a table within 15-20 minutes, we were very impressed!The restaurant is eclectic and modern, not the type of joint I usually find myself in. It was a nice change of pace. Being Restaurant Week, most of our party chose from the special menu offering three courses. I went with the rack of ribs though. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and tasty. My wife was impressed with her sushi and I heard nothing but sounds of approval from around the table.At the conclusion of the main courses, I shared a slice of carrot cake with my wife and it was fantastic. I'd highly recommend Hudson 29 for a date night, special occasion or business dinner.",Zach F.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,7/30/17,"We really wanted to love this place, but for being a more upscale restaurant, the food was average at best. The good: service was excellent, and we enjoyed sitting out on the patio. Even though it was hotter than Hades, the fans created a breeze that made the heat bearable. Plus, our server provided great drink recommendations that were very refreshing. The meh: All of the food we tried, particularly given the cost. We started off with the cheese dinner rolls, which were basically a roll with cheese melted on it. It was edible but nothing particularly innovative or delicious about it (I know, how can cheese and bread be anything less than delicious?!) It felt like something you might make as an afternoon snack for a kid when all you have in your house is leftover cheese and some bread. Let's just say they aren't even in the same league as bosco sticks or Kilroy's breadsticks. I then made the mistake of ordering a sushi roll. Once again, it was edible...but it was tiny and looked and tasted like grocery store sushi. Plus, the roll was loosely rolled and came apart. For $14, I expect a better looking and tasting, fancier sushi roll. If you are into sushi rolls at all, I do not recommend ordering them here. My husband got the prime rib. He said it was decent but nothing special. I would probably go back to Hudson 29 for drinks at happy hour, but I would not eat there again or recommend it to anyone unless they really increased the quality of their dishes.",Candice G.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2007/10/17,Another visit and I'm still impressed! Our server was Kimberly and she was awesome! I got the filet and it was cooked perfectly. I ordered a bottle of the grapefruit fresco and it was delicious! I was with a party of about 11-12 people and they were very aommodating since it was a surprise birthday dinner. We brought cake as well and they were able to keep it in the freezer and cut us slices when dinner was over! I'm looking forward to our next dinner at Hudson!,Trinh T.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,5/24/17,"Reservation is most likely needed, esp on weekend. We were lucky enough to get a rounded booth. Which was cozy and even comfortable for tall 6'4 friend.Started off w:Queso-My friend ordered and I just tried a bite, I didn't get any chorizo in my bite which prob would've made it better.Rolls w Butter & Cheese-I mean what is not to like? Not sure about this trend about paying for the bread, but at least it keeps me focused and not carb loading before the meal.Split the house salad which is just my fav. Ladies went w filets, gentlemen with prime rib. First, I like prime rib, not my most fav thing...but this was so delicious. Hubby was nice enough to give me another bite. Our friend said it was probably one of the best meals he has had put in a year.Service was prompt. Every time we go out for an above average dinner, we usually go with Cameron Mitchell place. It never disappoints and above all is consistent with great service. Plus, this location has a great feeling.",Erin D.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,8/19/16,"Flatbreads, salads, sandwiches.. and sushi? It's an eclectic combo but the food is good, there's plenty of alcohol :) and the space is quiet & attractive so the concept seems to work. Interesting microbrews from Cbus and elsewhere on tap for about $6/pint, very fair. Outdoor tables are nicely screened by greenery but you're still just one sidewalk from Lane Ave. Not exactly casual, dressing up is not out of place at Hudson 29.At lunch we sampled a delightfully crisp flatbread with chicken in bbq sauce, no char on the bottom but very tasty, $12. A blackened fish sandwich was a modest portion of grilled filets on a roll with great cabbage on top but I found no trace of blackening, $14. A surf-n-turf roll was tempura fried shrimp with raw beef carpaccio wrapped around the nori, nice, $14. Gracious, attentive service too. Vegetarian rating: weak 2 stars, choose from salads and a black bean burger; no entrees.Cocktails look *great*, about $10 each, must return to try 'em.",Chris L.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,3/24/17,"Had a really fantastic dinner here this evening.  We sat in a private room, for a friends birthday.Started with a sushi roll, that was just right.  Really delicious.  They didn't have low sodium soy sauce, and they should. Even a lot of sushi restaurants are only serving low sodium now.  Trick:  cut your soy sauce with half iced water, will halve the sodium and you won't even be able to tell, just put a couple spoonfuls of water into your soy sauce dish.Also had the cheese rolls, which were good, but not great.  Flavor was a little flat.Tried the Queso dip, was good, but not great.  We also had a charcuterie board, for which I've seen better.  The blue cheese was very good, as were the crostini.Dinner I had the steak and cheese enchilada, and it was exceptional.  The MolÌ© sauce on the enchilada was perfect, and rivaled some of the best Mexican places.  Steak was tender and cooked right on par, perfect medium rare.  Full of flavor.  The corn salad was a nice touch, tasty, but somehow seemed misplaced with the enchilada and the steak.  Salad was also missing a seasoning, perhaps just some salt, maybe a little diced jalapeÌ±o or pickled onion would bring it up that final notch.Also tried several bites of the red snapper, and it was delicate, fresh, and had a wonderful mild flavor.  The mustard sauces paired well.We had all of the desserts...donut holes with caramel sauce, orange pound cake, Texas sheet cake, and carrot cake.  Each one exceeded expectations.  The donut holes were the best.  The Texas sheet cake was too light for sheet cake and the icing wasn't the best.  I've had much better, including my own.  This is not to say, it wasn't good, it was.  But if I had to settle on one dessert it would be the donut holes (which of the four, having never had them I would have chosen them last.). The caramel sauce was homemade, buttery and rich, tasting of dark brown sugar.  Paired so well with the wonderfully executed donut holes.Good service.  Food came out surprisingly fast, though well timed so we could finish appetizers.  Also for having such an eclectic menu, and being able to execute such diverse dishes without flaw is super impressive.  You can also tell the ingredients are quality, well sourced, and fresh.  Will return.",Jared E.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,2012/4/17,"I wasn't impressed. Granted it has been quite some time since I ate there, but it was incredibly loud and overly expensive. The food didn't tickle my twine. I thought it would be quite the hoity-toity fancy place, so we went as a girls night and unfortunately none of my gal pals were thrilled either (age range from 28 to 70).

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,7/15/17,"My friends and I went here for Restaurant Week. The ambiance was very chill and trendy. I've never been to this place before so I had no expectation and avoided Yelp to experience things first hand. The employees were very friendly and service was fast. Everyone got their food and I sat there waited and waited. I think they forgot my order so I was confused to why I'm eating my friend's appetizers. I asked the waitress about it and she went to go check and came back with the manager. Apparently they had forgot the order but the manager was very nice and comp'ed my meal for their mistake. The food came out immediately afterward but I was too full by then to enjoy the food fully. I applaud their great turnaround on the mistake. I'm not the kind of person that would get mad about an issue like that but it was very nice to get my meal for free. The food overall is very good. The cocktail drinks were also very tasty, nothing too strong but still a nice kick. I would definitely come back again for date night with my wife.",David T.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2005/10/16,"Every so often, you deserve to treat yourself, right? That's what I thought, so I decided on the very swanky but unpretentious Hudson 29 for a self-date lunch. It turned out to be a lovely choice for any kind of date: self, partner, friend, parent, adult child (I'll let parents of child-children decide if it's good for youngsters too).The hostess sat me in a small booth, just perfect for a solo diner. There is a rectangular bar in the middle of the first room, where I imagine I'd have ended up if it were a crowded time, but a Monday lunch is pretty sparse. The server -- Anna, if I'm not mistaken -- was very attentive and always prompt.I asked for hot tea, and she brought out a fancy schmancy wood box with little cups of loose tea, about twelve options including black, green, and herbal. I went with jasmine pearl, a favorite of mine. I forgot to look for or ask about tea brand, but no matter. It came in a little metal pot, the tea in a sachet, not steeped yet. Cup, saucer, lemon slice, nice and pretty.All the specials sounded delicious. If I recall them correctly, there was a roasted red pepper soup and a yellowjack with a quinoa side. There was an omelette special, and it was veggie, but that's all I caught about that. I ordered off the regular menu, though, going with the wood grilled salmon. It comes with a couscous salad with ""raisins, almonds, cucumber, radish, citrus vinaigrette,"" according to the menu, and I think there was another green veg in there, too.I made sure to ask whether the couscous was made in broth or water -- the answer was water. I didn't think to ask about butter, though, and it did end up tasting a little buttery. This is my second time at a Cameron Mitchell restaurant, and my impression is that they are extremely conscientious about dietary concerns *if* you mention them. They'll work with you to prepare something friendly to your needs and will do so without hesitating or stumbling. But you may have to remember to ask. They don't decorate the menu at Hudson 29 with handy little Vs or anything.My salmon was excellent. Tender and flaky, almost creamy. The couscous balanced it beautifully. Although it didn't look like a lot of food on the plate when it arrived, it ended up being just right. Finishing up with the bill went smoothly as well.It's pricy but worth an occasionI'll need only gentle persuasionTo visit againThe menu's a tenSo let's plan our Hudson invasion.",Lea P.,,,,,,

It was essentially a muffin filled with cheese with marinara dipping sauce... really good, but I would not pay $8 for 3 rolls moving forward.

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,2008/3/17,The inside of Hudson 29 is dark and romantic which I liked.  There were a lot of books for privacy!  The food was good but I believed over priced however I am from Indiana where the market is a little less expensive. All in all it was ok I would go running back though....,Brooklyn W.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,2003/12/17,"I ordered the burger. Fortunately I cut it in half before taking a bite. The burger patty was completely raw ! It was so mushy and pink as if you could roll it into a meatball. They took the burger off the bill and asked if I wanted anything else to eat but I was too grossed out. They ended up giving my husband and I a free dessert. The manager came out and apologized, but our server failed to check on us and  didn't refill our drinks. He was neglectful. The food was overpriced for the low quality of ingredients.I usually like all Cameron Mitchell restaurants, especially Pearl, The Barn, And Marcellas, but this is by far the worst restaurant of his chain.",Lea W.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2003/3/16,"I feel like people forget about Hudson 29 sometimes but they shouldn't! A girlfriend and I got dinner here and it was way better than I would have expected. It's so unassuming just hanging out on Lane Avenue across from Whole Foods Market. The first reason I love it is because I'm a sucker for a good cocktail but am expecting and don't plan to get tipsy these 9 months. When offered a cocktail from our server, I cheekily said ""I'll take a mocktail"" and she smiled and said ""absolutely,"" then came back with an overly delicious beverage! To start, we got the dip trio which had guacamole, smoked trout dip and hummus -- yes, please! It was a sizable dish that could have been shared with a few others (if you're into sharing). For dinner, I got the buttermilk chicken sandwich which was fantastic. I mostly just restaurants off their cocktails and fried chicken so they've been nailing it so far. I'm pretty sure it was brined in pickle juice because it had that vinegary delicious crispness that comes with pickles.I actually saw so many delicious things on their menu that I'll absolutely be back!",Hannah L.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,2010/4/16,Food was good I like to sit at the bar because you usually get fast attentive service. Not the case tonight Our server Jade stared out great but it was clear that she had friends or family at the end of the bar.  Clearly more interested in them than us. We sat at the bar for 15 minutes with a glass of empty wine. I probably would have ordered more food and drinks but did not want to wait for service.,Micaela S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,3/20/16,"My visit to Hudson 29 was mediocre. Both the interior and exterior are gorgeous, and the free parking garage behind the restaurant definitely helps. The environment was casual yet classy: I felt comfortable in jeans and a t-shirt but I could definitely see it being perfect for a romantic date night as well. The hostess was a little snotty and extremely slow with addressing us and seating us, but our waitress was very friendly. My husband had the pepperoni flatbread, which was super thin and crispy. He loved it. After looking at reviews on Yelp I ordered the cheeseburger because it is the most photogenic burger I've ever seen in my life. Mine was presented just as beautifully as what I was hoping, but the flavor just didn't pop like I was expecting from a $16 burger. It wasn't greasy at all and definitely tasted fresh, but the ground meat was a tad too chewy for my liking. Reminded me of a Wendy's hamburger patty, just on a much prettier toasted bun. At first they got my plate wrong and gave me a different side than I ordered, but they quickly fixed the issue. However, the side I requested and eventually received (couscous and kale salad) was not what I was expecting at all. It was full of kale, almonds and raisins which is exactly what I wanted, but unfortunately EVERYTHING tasted like pickles. The sour vinegar taste was so strong and since I'm not a pickle fan it just ruined it for me. Very misleading. The highlight of our visit, though, was definitely the pineapple upside down doughnut holes with caramel sauce. They were so light and airy, not greasy at all, and you could see little bits of pineapple inside. They were absolutely perfect and totally worth the hour drive! We did see them wait on the pass for almost 5 minutes before finally being delivered to us though, so the service isn't perfect. Overall, Hudson 29 tasted too average to justify the long drive and overpriced menu items...but thank goodness for those doughnut holes!",Jessica L.,,,,,,

But all in all not worth the price ...1- Too noisy to comfortably converse with server or table mates.2- Server had to be asked the ""local beer"" twice & acted as if she wanted to deal with us as little as possible.3- While the food was decent, it was nothing special.4- I have never been in a place that could not give me a list of the liquors on the bar!!! Nor could the servers tell you. We had to go into the bar, stand behind seated folks and try to read the labels from 10 foot away. The menu only has their mixed drinks..",John A.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,9/25/16,I have been to Hudson 29 multiple times and it always lives up to my expectations. My favorite item by far is the steak and enchilada. It is not too heavy. The steak is a hanger steak and has so much flavor. The enchilada is on the sweeter side and pairs well with the corn medley it comes with. They also make a mean sangria and blood orange margarita. I do not recommend their black bean burger - I thought it lacked flavor. The desserts are good too - my favorite was the carrot cake but I also have had the pineapple upside down cake with caramel glaze and the strawberry shortcake.,Madison D.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,9/16/17,"The best roasted chicken I've ever had. I was blown away - awesomely browned skin, succulent juice to sop up with each bite. I love that it was partially deboned which makes it easy to cut into and eat. The roasted corn on the side was unique and a fresh bite to pair with the chicken. I visit the area for work and like to try new restaurants every time I visit, but I might find myself coming back here for the chicken. It was that good. I sat at the bar and service was great. I also appreciated the free garage parking.",Lisa S.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2001/8/16,"I had a very positive experience on New Year's Eve at Hudson 29. I was with a larger group of people (7) and received great service. Our waiter was very knowledgable of the menu and was attentive to our needs throughout the entire dinner. Their cocktails are amazing! I tried the Ginger Beer cocktail. It was the perfect amount of sweetness with the rye. For dinner I got the Arugula salad. I would recommend this salad as everything tasted very fresh and the amount of dressing was perfect. I also tried the pepperoni flatbread pizza. It was decent - nothing special about it. I probably would not order it again. However, I would recommend the Surf and Turf sushi roll. I found it to be a unique option compared to traditional sushi rolls. The ambiance is very classy. It would be a great spot for a romantic date night. There is a parking garage behind the building if you can't find street parking.",Maria P.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,2,2009/1/16,"I've been here twice now and it's really just OK.  Whenever a place has a ""vegetable flat bread"" with no actual real vegetables, only peppers,  mushrooms, and onions, I'm really not impressed.  I can get that at Papa Johns.  On my second visit, I had what is called ""Roasted Chicken Salad.""  It should be called the Treasure Hunt salad as it is basically a whole clamshell package of mixed greens with about 4 pieces of chicken and three beets.  Even if I had opted to keep the onions and peppers in the salad, it would have been a mountain of lettuce with very little else.  The first time we went here, in November, they attempted to seat us outside because they ""reserve indoor seating for those with reservations.""",Lisa P.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,2,1/16/17,"Disappointing for a Cameron Mitchell restaurant. Food was fine. Service was not great. I'll go again if my friends want to go sometime, but I'm never suggesting it. Our server made me feel like doing her job was an inconvenience to her day. Nothing to write home about. With so many amazing places to eat in Columbus, I won't be sad if I never go back. Butter rolls were the best part of my meal. Sushi is good, braised short rib was fine, a little tough. Sheet cake with ice cream was good but should've been warmed up. I just feel like I should have better words to use than good and fine and I don't.",Tana K.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,1/31/16,"I came to Hudson 29 venturing down from Delaware for brunch.   I parked in the free parking garage and entered in the restaurant and say at the bar. The bartender came over and took my drink order a spicy bloody mary, garnished with a fresh basil leaf, cherry tomato and fresh mozzarella ball.  It was a good bloody.   The bartender suggested I order the short rib hash, so I did and it was a great brunch dish with two perfectly poached eggs, fresh chips, pico, tomatillo salsa and lime.  Total damage before tip $24",Bill E.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,2009/10/17,"My friends and I joke sometimes that we've been ""Cameron Mitchell-ed"" whenever going to one of his restaurants. This meaning that you will receive good service and a nice clean atmosphere, but should expect to pay slightly higher prices for comparable items at some other Columbus sit-down restaurants. Hudson 29 is no exception. The dinner menu leans towards typical foods you'd find in any American restaurant. Things like sandwiches, prime rib, BBQ ribs, flatbread, and seafood options. Strangely, they also offer several sushi rolls which leads one to think there's some kind of menu identity crisis. Average price for a main dish is about $25. I've tried their crispy buttermilk chicken sandwich ($16), French dip ($19), and my restaurant buddy got the wood grilled salmon ($28). My favorite thing is the fries which come with all the sandwich options or a la carte ($5). The fries are thin cut, crispy, and well-seasoned with flecks of sea salt that are reminiscent of The Rossi's. But overall, we thought the value vs. flavor of the food was meh. That being said, I wouldn't mind returning if invited by friends or family, but would probably choose Marcella's or The Pearl if really looking for the Cameron Mitchell experience.",Erica N.,,,,,,

The salad that came with it was delicious! The scallops themselves varied wildly. A few were delicious, A couple others were a bit chewy and grimy. A few of us shared the chocolate cake with grater's ice cream. It was quite large, but I didn't much care for it. The service was at times annoying. The server was polite but he kept clearing our plates before we were done with the appetizers. This was really annoying. I don't understand the logic and I would have said something except that we were hosting an interviewee here... Anyway, I'm generally happy with Cameron Mitchell restaurants and will give it another try.",Ness S.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,9/13/15,"""What does heaven taste like?,"" I asked the stars above. Well, I found out on Saturday at Hudson 29. Celebrating the bae's birthday warranted a restaurant that wowed us, and even on a rainy, chilly night at 830p, H29 was in full swing. We started with the chorizo queso con chips and si si si muy bien! Unlike the paltry chicken-to-soup ratio one might find in a can of Campbell's, the chorizo in the queso was bountiful. Sinful amount of flavor in this dish.Our server Mike suggested the King-Kong roll to me, a delectable meaty and filling roll with warm scallops and spicy sauce. Amen, brother. I've had some questionable sushi lately and this dish alone reminded me that tremendous sushi still exists in this city.Here is what jay says about the French dip: ""don't get the French dip if you're impartial to French dip, but if you do like it, then this is a good choice. Really flavorful. The corned beef looked equally as good though."" DRAMA. There are so many great dishes. I think the dessert was my favorite part: warm donut upside-down pineapple cake balls lightly fried with a caramel dipping sauce. WHAT IS THIS. I could have eaten these until I exploded. The bad thing about restaurants like this is knowing that all other restaurants will henceforth be inferior to this dining experience.",Jessica D.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2010/3/14,"Still 4 stars.  Came for lunch shortly after opening time on a Friday.  The restaurant was surprisingly empty, but maybe we were ahead of the lunch rush.This time, I ordered much more wisely--Hudson 29 Cheeseburger with Kale and CousCous and a Manhattan (at lunchtime!) for me.  My wife had the black bean burger with fries and a fruity, vodka drink the bartender came up with.  I think this meal definitely plays to Hudson 29's strengths. Simple, straightforward American classics. Everything was fantastic, though the black bean burger is probably the second best veggie burger in CBus (still behind Northstar).  The service was excellent as always--just the right combination of attentiveness without being overbearing.",Vin R.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2/22/15,"Been holding out because I'm a little worried that Cameron Mitchell has basically monopolized the Cbus restaurant market.  Even if the food/service is hit or miss, people still flock to his establishments.  Anyways, the fiancÌ© gave me a CM gift card for a work promotion and we ventured out to lunch last Sunday.  And I am absolutely glad that I did and cannot wait to go back!  Here are my tasting notes:Cheese butter rolls:  If you like carbs and dairy (which I do), just get these.  Not earth shattering or a revelation, but this is solid comfort food done right.  Steak and shrimp tempura sushi:  This is now one of my favorite sushi rolls in town.  Every component is perfectly executed; from the rare filet mignon to the spicy mayo.  Cantonese noodle salad:  I love me an old school Asian salad and this one is awesome.  I love the fact that every item in this salad is perfectly chopped/cut including the cucumber and wonton strips.  I would've preferred a few more of the noodles and perhaps less chicken (and usually there is never enough protein!).  But overall, a solid salad.Crisp buttermilk chicken sandy:  probably my least favorite.  I expect a $14 fried chicken sandwich to somewhat knock my socks off, but this one was just ok.  Honestly, I would prefer a spicy chicken sandwich from Wendy's over Hudson 29's version.  However, the colcannon potatoes that accompanied the sandwich were delicious (mashed with horseradish) and I can definitely see myself ordering this one again.Fresh fruit juice:  Both the fiancÌ© and I were super hungover!  So, drinks were out of the question.  But, though not advertised, you are able to partake of fresh fruit juices.  We tried a grapefruit juice and a lemonade and both were super duper refreshing.Lastly, docking one star because of the price.  The food and ambiance was great, and the service fabulous.  However, the cost vs. what you get is not proportionate, especially considering that this is not really a special occasion restaurant (at least not judging by the menu).",Anna S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2005/8/16,"We went to Hudson 29 for a special occasion on Friday. There is a free parking garage attached which was very much appreciated since it is difficult to find street parking. Once inside, the restaurant is very dark in some places which made it difficult for the older people we were with to read the menu. The service was just okay and we switched waiters mid way into our meal so that was odd. Anyway the food-a solid four stars overall. I absolutely loved the crackery-thin crust of the Campari tomato flatbread and the generous amount of juicy tomato. We also got two sushi rolls, King Kong and Hawaii five-o, both surprisingly tiny for the $15 price tag. Literally THE tiniest pieces of sushi I have ever seen. The flavor of King Kong was good but the Hawaii five-o had a fishy taste, not the good kind. And again, the roll is the diameter of a quarter. Others at my table got burgers and salads and had no comments one way or another. Overall adequate food and adequate service but I was expecting a better experience from a Cameron Mitchell restaurant. This was my second visit with the same outcome. I'll probably go back because I want to love it so much but it'll be a while.",Betsy C.,,,,,,

I had the BBQ chicken flatbread which to me was bland. The crust tasted like a saltine. My son had the French dip, he said it was ok.

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,6/17/15,"This was a hard choice to make as I carefully had to evaluate my decision on giving this Cameron Mitchell restaurant four stars. Here it goes I was given a $25 gift card for visiting a dentists office. Who loves going to the dentist right? So you don't like to go to the dentist but the incentive to go to the open house is quite high because it's for a new associate and they might be giving pretty good stuff away. I enter my name into this drawing and who knows my name would be picked out of the bowl for not only a $25 gift card to any Cameron Mitchell restaurant but a free appetizer to 101 Beer Kitchen as well. Dam! Well that was a good reason to come to the open house even though we as human beings dread seeing the dentist sometimes!So how did we come to choosing Hudson 29 of all the different options we had? We of course looked at our handy dandy Yelp app that gave this particular restaurant a higher review than most of the others, plus the convenience of the area was a big factor into it as well. My husband and I wanted a short drive from our house because we were so hungry and it was 8:00 at night. I know eating late at night is not ideal but sometimes when you have no choice you must sustain your body somehow.We arrive at Hudson 29 in about 20 minutes which is awesome timing but we park across the street by the Whole Foods. So we cross the street and arrive in this very nice atmosphere, it almost made me felt like I was under-dressed! Well to say the least I was and this is a very casual environment. I was in a shirt, shorts and flip flops which is not ideal but okay for the time, I wouldn't arrive like this on a weekend as it would be embarrassing. My husband was better dressed than me and he was in his work attire!!!My husband ordered the St. Louis Ribs and loved how they just fell right off the bone and were so tender. The barbeque sauce was excellent he said as well. I ordered the black bean burger and couscous kale salad. Two great choices. Except I ruined my black bean burger by putting the salad dressing which I thought was mayo on it! My bad! I learned my lesson and will not judge what I thought of that burger as it might sound bad because of my misunderstanding of the side!I highly recommend the restaurant to those looking for a nice casual night out in a great American restaurant.",Tammy A.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,12/15/14,"We were a party of 4 on friday night and had 6:00 reservations.  We were seated in a roomy booth by the bar and had a wonderful female server.  This is definitely a special occasion place, given my entree was $26 and the specialty drinks are $10.  Perfect for date night, it's dark & sexy.  The bar alone looked like a romantic place to sit for a drink or a meal.  There is parking behind the restaurant, which is shared with the residents above it.      Interesting ladies room observation:  the floor to ceiling wood doors for the 2 stalls have ""in use"" notifications when you flip the lock inside.  I don't think I've ever seen this in a restroom other than porta potties and airplanes, but  it's useful. The weird thing was there is a big gap from the floor on the wall separating the two stalls, so you can see the other occupant's feet.Enough about the restroom.  The friday night special that I chose is the pan-fried fish, which was basically fish 'n chips.  I had two pieces of lightly breaded fish with shoestring fries, and the most amazing slaw I've ever had.  The fish was wonderfully light.  I'm not a shoestring fry fan, but they suited the entree because they are lighter than steak fries that are usually served with heavy fried fish.  My husband had the prime rib with mashed potatoes.  The couple we were with had the rigatoni bolognese and the campari tomato flatbread.

The guacamole had that standard restaurant flavor to it where it tastes all preservativey (chipotle has ruined all other guac for me). Finally, the smoked salmon was actually good and improves the dish greatly. I ordered the hanger steak and enchilada. It was medium rare and it may be the best hanger steak I've ever had. It was flavorful and decadent. However, the sides were lacking. The enchilada tasted like it had just come out of the microwave and was nothing special. Moreover, the corn and avocado salad was just plain bland. My fiancÌ© ordered the scallops. I had two separate tastes and the two were not consistent. I would say that for $30, that should be a slammin dish. Alas, they were merely acceptable. We each had a glass of wine and I had the bourbon honey mixed drink (pretty good). I know what you may be thinking: ""Dave, it didn't seem that bad, why three stars?""  I'll tell you. It's because that mediocre meal cost $110 plus tip. I would have given this a four star rating had it been a $80 meal. However, the flavors don't justify the cost.",Dave W.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2006/8/16,"Very great ambiance and service (again, way to go, Cameron Mitchell)! The location is perfect for its cuisine and price, as it provides an up-scale touch of healthy and innovative food options. Their burgers, sushi and salads are terrific, while some of the big entrees (steak and fish), in my opinion, focus more on the ingredients side than the taste and flavors side. Overall, a great restaurant for occasions and lunches that sits close to Upper Arlington.",Wenfan C.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2003/7/15,"We sat and ate at the bar. Our server was top notch. My husband loved his draft beer. My mixed drink was good, but not good enough to order a second one.The Cheese Stuffed House Baked Butter Rolls were a wonderful start to our meal. They were served with a side of warm marinara sauce for dipping. This appetizer includes three rolls, and easily serves three people. There were only two of us, and we divided the third roll in half and tried not to eat it before our entrees arrived. We will definitely order this again.I ordered the St. Louis BBQ Ribs. I love ribs. I order them pretty much everywhere I dine. These were not good. They weren't bad, but I won't be ordering them here again. They lacked any flavor aside from pepper. I'm not sure how a piece of meat with so many herbs and spices slathered on it could taste as flavorless as it did. I only ate half of them. I took the other half home and put some store-bought sauce on them before finishing them later in the evening. The ribs were served with fries, which were really good, and slaw that was also very tasty.My husband had the French Dip sandwich. He loved it. I was jealous. It looked wonderful. I may be ordering it on our next visit.We split the Texas Sheet Cake for dessert. It was good, but I'll try something else next time.Overall, it was good enough for us to plan our next visit as we drove home.",Angela U.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2009/8/16,"Hudson 29 is terrific for what it is: a neighborhood, very-nice, american fare bar and restaurant. Service was great, but not too social. Food was above-average. Oh...def recommend the homemade boozy sodas.",Lauren E.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,11/23/14,"This place is great! I love the ambiance in the dining room- very romantic. I went with a few girlfriends and we split a bottle of wine and all got sushi. I am not a raw fish type of person so I got the surf and turf sushi roll. It was ah-maze-balls! The filet is raw on the outside, which I had never had before but it was delish! All of the main entrees are on the pricier side (around $25) the sushi was more reasonable, $15 for my roll. I highly recommend this place for a nice date or get together with friends!",Whitney S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,2008/1/14,"Good, not great.  Fine, not fantastic.Dark wood, low-lighting, clubby, crowded, loud.  By ""clubby"" I mean old white guys at Ted Knight's country club in Caddyshack.The service was attentive. The food was good, but definitely NOT great. Prices are high for what you get.  Only Cameron has the nerve to charge you $7.00 for 3 dinner rolls with some cheese melted on top.On a Friday night, the place was PACKED.  This is clearly ""the"" place in Arlington at the moment.  I was frankly surprised by the clientele, because I expected mostly 50- and 60-something divorcees, and there were plenty of those, but there were also lots of younger couples (mostly DINKS) having a drink after work or an evening out.Definitely not a t-shirts and casual shorts kind of place.  Folks were mostly dressed to be seen, except for a few rich old white guys in golf shorts and Birkenstocks or leather flip flops (I kid you not).Definitely not a place I'd take children.  The management would probably say they're kid-friendly, but I wouldn't bring our kids here.In the restaurant business they say ""location, location, location"".  Hudson 29 will bear that out.  There are DEFINITELY better restaurants in Columbus, but this will do well in spite of itself.All in all, I'm underwhelmed, but am sure Cameron will make a killing here among the Arlington pretty people.",Fred B.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,6/17/16,Had a business dinner here when I attended OSU for a conference. Creative menu! I had their black bean burger. It was really good (not dry at all) and had a little kick to it. The service was fantastic (the split our check 6 ways without batting an eyelash) and the outdoor patio was a great seating option.,Katie C.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,9/19/16,This is a good place for a nice meal with a great outdoor seating area. The cheese filled dinner rolls as appetizers were disappointing however the sushi was very tasty and the burger was also quite good done just right. The sides are plenty for two and the service is adequate. If you are in the area looking for a good meal with a nice variety on the menu it is worth looking into.,Rob K.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2009/7/14,"We really enjoyed our belated anniversary celebration. We are going through the alphabet to encourage us to try new places Hudson was our go to place for""H"". The drinks, salads, entrees and dessert were great. The timing was seriously off. The entrees came before we could finish our salads and the shared appetizer. We called the manager over and he was very pleasant and listened attentively. He also adjusted the bill accordingly and treated us nicely.  We will be back! And recommend you try it too.",Gail G.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,6/23/14,"First of all, let me start off by saying that the quality of the food here is excellent. I dined here on 6/22/14 and ordered the prime rib, which was one of the best prime ribs I've ever had in Columbus. My wife had the rigatoni and the arugula salad. She liked both dishes, but I think she was disappointed that they don't offer a wedge salad like most of the other Cameron Mitchell restaurants. We also shared the dip trio and the hand cut french fries. The dip trio, on paper, makes no sense. (guacamole, hummus, and smoked trout?) But in actuality, each dip is excellent, and doesn't crash with each other like one might think. If I were to judge this restaurant on the quality of food by itself, I would give it 5 stars.The interior decor is nice, although it's way too dark inside. Next time, we'll plan on sitting on the outdoor patio.The servers here are very courteous and professional. As expected of a Cameron Mitchell restaurant. What prevents me from giving this restaurant a 5 star rating is the way their menu is set up. Although I came away feeling like I got an excellent meal and an excellent value, I can easily see how some others might be turned off by their pricing. $29 for an amazing prime rib is... well, amazing. $17 for a reuben sandwich on the other hand is ridiculous. Does that reuben sandwich come with a side of lobster mac & cheese or something? $10 for a side of california rolls is overkill as well... you could get the same thing elsewhere for $5.Also disappointing is that they don't give you bread-- if you want bread, you need to order their $6 cheesy bread as a side. So depending on what you order at this restaurant, you might have a 5 star experience, or you might have a 3 star experience. Choose your dishes wisely, I guess.",Kaoru M.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,8/15/14,"We drove by this place while we were in the area and decided to give it a go.  It was about 1pm on a Saturday and the few people that were there were on the patio.  The hostess and servers are all dressed in the kind of outfits you'd find at a high end restaurant. The ambience was dark with candles lit and seemed like it was geared toward young 20-somethings with disposable sushi income but there's a big ol' bar with sports going on TV's.   So this place seems to suffer from a bit of an identity crisis.We spy the hot buttered cheese rolls on the menu and knew those will be had.  She brought them out and the only disappointment is there were three instead of four which meant I was going to have to maim my husband for one.  We chose to split instead of end up at the hospital over these perfectly buttery, cheesy bites of heaven.  I ordered the Rigatoni Bolognese and the hubby ordered the prime rib.  Oddly, the prices weren't too far off from each other.  The rigatoni was good.  The beef in the Bolognese is beef roast, not ground beef in case that makes a difference to anyone thinking about it.  I wasn't a huge fan of that but it was fine.  I kinda wished I had saved my half of the butter roll to sop up the sauce.  The hubs got the prime rib with colcannon potatoes (mashed potatoes with scallions, cabbage and horseradish but she let him try some before he ordered so he knew if he'd like it or not.)  He said it was good but when he gave me a bite, I knew darn well it was overcooked for his taste and he confessed it was.  (No pink at all)  The flavor was decent and he said the further he got into the potatoes, the more pronounced the horseradish got so he didn't finish them and said he wouldn't get them again.As we were ready for our check, the server went into the desserts, which we weren't interested in.  Then she said the magic words.  Texas Sheet Cake for him and Pineapple Upside Down Donuts for me.  Oh hell, why not bust the button on my jeans.  I'm not a sheet cake kind of gal so I wasn't impressed with the bite I had of his (a generous portion for sure!) but I was kind of bummed with mine.  When one says pineapple upside down anything, you think of a heavily butter soaked cake with pineapple goodness.  These were more like the malasadas (fried dough balls coated in sugar) we get in Hawaii, which isn't a bad thing but not what I had my mouth set on.  The caramel sauce was kind of gross too.  So I wished I hadn't been suckered by the seductive description.  I'm not sure yet if I'd go back but I might for those rolls...one order for me and one for him because I'm not sharing!!",A. S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2007/7/16,Had the Blackened Fish Sandwich. Quite good. But what I really enjoyed was the corn and avocado side that came with my sandwich. Just wished it had more avocado.,Sakellarios V.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,11/16/15,"We had a great time grabbing a drink and early dinner here. I liked the decor a lot. It was open but cozy and welcoming. The wine cellar is gorgeous. We started at the bar and the bartender was fantastic! He made a great wine suggestion that we followed with dinner. Tried two of the bottled cocktails which were quite tasty! They make them in house and they bottle and carbonate them. Yum! The Bourbon Cola and the Blood Orange Margarita were both very well balanced. Would definitely order them again. They recommended the dips which were good but not a stand out. I did enjoy the house made lime chips. The cheese rolls were good if a little out of place on the menu. Would have been killer along side some pasta. We tried 3 of the sushi rolls. I enjoyed the Hawaii 5 O and the Surf and Turf quite a bit. The Hudson, I believe had apple in it which was interesting.

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,5/22/14,"Cameron Mitchell never disappoints. This is what I thought as I rolled out of here Wednesday night, fully satisfied.My friend tried to make reservations for the two of us online and there were only very early or very late times, so he decided to call, and we needed to add people to our party to get in at prime time. I texted Boyfriend, and we were good to go for 5:45pm.When we got there, we parked in the parking garage and walked in the back door to the restaurant. I'm not sure how many people do that, I accidentally walked in on a chef meeting and one of them backed into me and stepped on my foot as I tried to get around. Clearly, he was very apologetic, and I was very fine.We were given the option to sit immediately inside or wait until a table opened on their patio which was my vote because I always love patios but also I hate overly air conditioned spaces,  which is what I was feeling by the front desk. It only took about 10 minutes and we were happily seated outside with glasses of waters poured by someone who seemed to be a designated water-pourer. He didn't say a word, just poured our water and sidled away to do the same at nearby tables.Our waitress came and greeted us and was the picture of friendly and attentive the whole meal. She recommended the triple dip appetizer and encouraged me to get the fries, especially when I was tempted to branch out and try one their less traditional snacks. The dips were all amazing, the chips clearly made in house, and when our meals came, things just got even better. Black bean patties are hit or miss everywhere you go, and more often than not, they're a miss. She encouraged us to try them and she was dead on. The patty was very simple, very soft, and just excellent. The bun was great, the sweet pickle mayo was to die for and I hate sweet pickles, and the fries were amazing as promised.Pricewise, I feel like everyone assumes a night out at a Cameron Mitchell restaurant is expensive, and it is when you're going for seafood and steaks. But for $13, I think that was very fair and reasonable for a huge burger and side and I could not finish. Luckily, she offered to box it up for me (I'm always a fan of that)!",Brandi H.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,6/21/14,"I grew up in Upper Arlington and never found any of the area dining establishments worthy of a true five-star review.  The high reviews I have given to Tommy's pizza down the street from here is more for nostalgia, but most Yelpers would not say it is a five-star place.  New to UA this year, Hudson 29 is definitely a top-notch experience.The decor is modern, with dark wood, romantic lighting and a great view of the goings-on in the kitchen.  If I were on business in the area, I would not hesitate to take a client here or even just sit at the large bar and enjoy a meal by myselfThe price points are not cheap - $15+ sandwiches, $10+ salads, $20+ entrees.  There are relatively inexpensive flatbreads. Strangely there are a few choices of sushi rolls, but most of the menu is standard American fare (steaks, chicken, fish).The absolute highlight of our experience here was our server, Desiree.  She memorized all five of our names and used them throughout the service.  Our iced teas and waters never went empty without being served another. She bused the table quickly and discreetly.  She wasn't  pushy, and patiently waited while we pursued the big menu.  She was a wonderful server. For food, my wife knows I love prime rib french dip sandwich.  It was a big portion of perfectly medium rare beef with horseradish sauce and the au jus.  While I was blowing my diet, I opted for the French fries, which were fresh cut with skins on the ends. My wife loved her Cantonese salad. As did my step-mother her Grilled chicken salad. My dad devoured the barbecue chicken flatbread.  The best thing we ate - and everything was excellent - was the sweet corn bisque. I have a relatively few restaurant we ""must"" hit when we come back home. I think Hudson 29 just got added to the list!",Marc M.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,2005/8/16,"Location:On Lane Avenue directly across from shopping mall.  Close to OSU campus so a perfect before or after destination for concerts at The Schott, athletic events or shopping. Traffic may be a concern at peak times.  Access is easy from 315 or Riverside Drive. Parking:Large covered garage behind restaurant.  Signage not obvious but covered garage has inside access to establishment so it's a plus in bad weather.  Parking is free.Ambiance:Restaurant seating surrounds large central bar area.  Private rooms available.  Large inviting waiting area with fireplace and super comfortable family room feel with couches and chairs.  Entering from parking garage is a bit awkward as you have to walk through back dining area.  This would be annoying to me if seated in that part of the establishment.  Decor is casual chic with leather booths that are roomy and comfortable.  Outdoor street front patio dining is also available in good weather and can be enclosed when weather threatens.  Has a typical New York old school steakhouse feel about it.  Background music is 80s soft to classic rock and well chosen.  Booth seating around bar area has view of numerous big screen televisions showing various programming.  Private rooms have them as well.Service:Prompt and attentive.  Knowledgeable clean cut wait staff.  Numerous managers make the rounds as well so you are never waiting long for any kind of attention but not so much it's bothersome.FoodI found the menu limited as far as entrees and appetizers were concerned.  The menu is an odd mix of surf and turf, sushi and sandwiches.  Entree pairings are equally offbeat with some great proteins being paired with seemingly out of place compliments like kael, lima beans and couscous.  She had salmon, I had strip steak special.  Hers was paired with aforementioned couscous mine with an interesting mix of various new potatoes, lima beans ( I think), all tossed in a caper vinaigrette that was way too sharp for my tastes.  Her plate was basically a huge portion of couscous and a mid sized salmon portion.  I ordered my steak medium and the server came back after we ordered to confirm my preference.  However, the steak arrived grossly undercooked (cool to the touch internally) and had to be sent back to be prepared correctly.  This basically ruined the flavor unfortunately.  I also found the cut to be of substandard quality and riddled with gristle in parts.  Of the advertised 12 ounces, at best, 6 to 8 were edible unfortunately.Drinks:Wine list was a bit thin but it's a full service bar.  I was a bit surprised that water service was without ice at the table which was annoying.  Who likes room temperature water after a few minutes in the glass?  While the water is presented tableside in a container that's opened on the spot, I have little doubt it's a fancy way of packaging good old tap water and nothing special at all.  Nice presentation though!  They make a big deal about the house specialty carbonated cocktails but the grapefruit Fresca one I tried was simply awful after just one sip, so I ordered a glass of wine instead. Conclusion:I'm just one reviewer and these are my personal observations but the food does not justify the pricing in my opinion at least where my Entree was concerned.   It's a beautiful place but you can't eat ambiance.  As part of the Cameron Mitchell empire, this one could use some attention to the food details as much as was paid to the surroundings they are served in got. Just one opinion but many of his other establishments fare much better in my book.",Sam D.,,,,,,

From the sauces to the fine knife cuts on everything, including the scallions.  Nothing goes unnoticed on the plates. As I watched fellow diners, I noticed every plate leaving the tables empty. Good sign always!Right there with the food is their service! You are always acknowledged by someone and if you make eye contact they are right there to see if you need something. Management is always walking around and talking to guests which makes me feel at home.

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2007/4/14,"Very good food  Dinner date and Hudson 29 was the venue to try!  Upon entering it was clear they were busy, we had to wait 5 or 10 minutes before being seated.  No biggie, we were seated in their patio area which was pleasant (but loud).  To start we had the shrimp taquitos appetizer.  It came out really fast with 5 shrimp taquitos and garnish on the plate.  The dish was tasty, but seasoning on the shrimp would have made it excellent.  For entree I had the scallops dish.  Again, really fast service with the food coming out in no time at all.  Considering the price it was not much food on the scallops dish.  If I remember right 5 or 6 scallops and the rest of the entree offerings (beets, greens, tomatoes).  The beets were amazing as was were the greens.  Well dressed and kept simple.  The tomatoes were alright, but a bit large.  The scallops were very good, could have been just a bit more firm but still cooked well and had good flavor.  It seemed like I ate the dish in 2 or 3 minutes!  Thankfully I enjoyed every bite.  I will definitely be back.",Will P.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2/21/15,"I am in awe of Cameron Mitchell Restaurants... They get it right. Every. Single. Time. And Hudson 29 is no exception.H29 was honestly not on my radar. It's in Upper Arlington (where I rarely go), and I had some preconceived ideas that it was stuffy and highfalutin. But on a random, snowy Monday night, The Mister and I found ourselves in the area and decided to give this place a try. (Pro tip: All CM restaurants use OpenTable for reservations.)Parking was a breeze with ample spots right out front on the street. And when we walked in, all my fears quickly subsided. The interior of Hudson 29 is absolutely gorgeous and right up my alley--dark, lots of warm wood, rich leather, and colorful artwork on the walls. It is a perfect date spot!We were greeted so warmly by the GM, and aside from a bit of confusion over who actually was our server, the service was spectacular. But here's why Hudson 29 knocked this experience out of the park for me: I have this wheat thing, and CM restaurants make gluten-free dining absolutely delightful. I try not to make a big deal out of it, so at most places I end up with an awkward hamburger patty on a pile of lettuce (or something equally as odd). Not here. They have an entire GF menu that's chock full of delicious choices that make me feel like a real person out to dinner. And their servers are all hyper-cognizant of wheat and gluten, so they are extremely helpful in making choices. I had a french dip and a side of fries, and it was pure perfection. The french bread they use is so good I was actually afraid to eat it before making our lovely server double check that it was safe. The beef was tender and juicy, and there was melted cheese in all the right places. The au jus was exactly the right condiment for dipping. For drinks, I started with a French 75, which was perfectly crafted, and then we split a bottled cocktail. Let me repeat that: THEY HAVE HOUSE-MADE BOTTLED COCKTAILS. Ours was a blood orange margarita, and it was tart, just sweet enough, and effervescent. I cannot wait to come back when the weather is warm and sit on their patio and get tipsy on these cocktails. The Mister is a gluten lover, and he liked Hudson 29 about as much as I did. It was just so special for me because they treated ME special--and not like a weirdo that most places do. I would venture to say this is my favorite meal of 2015 so far!",Bryant M.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,2,7/19/16,Went for our anniversary last night. I had the fresh Alaskan Salmon. Had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. My wife had the Prime Rib. Pretty blah as well.

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,2006/5/16,"Dip Trio was very processed and did not seem high quality.  Tasted very preservativey.  The chips served with the trio were no better than a bag of tortilla chips from Kroger.  Sushi also appeared to be from Kroger or Giant Eagle.  They claim to roll in house but it just wasn't quality at all...definitely not fresh.  Chicken salad sandwich was covered in mayo, served on grocery store bread.  It was so bad I had to order coffee just to get the taste to go away.  My first thought was this is Champs with a much higher price.  On second thought Champs serves higher quality food.  Everything about this place screams ""Use low quality everything to MAXIMIZE PROFITS"".  I'm not bashing all Cameron establishments.  I'm very fond of Cap City, but Hudson left me wondering if it's Cameron's experiment to see what he can get away with.  The third star is for service - they do a good job with that.",Matt H.,,,,,,

For food, I ordered the King Kong sushi roll and the surf and turf sushi roll. Both were great! The King Kong roll reminded me of a California roll with scallops mixed with spicy mayo on top. The surf and turf was my favorite, as it had a thin filet mignon topped roll, with tempura shrimp. Overall, great atmosphere with great food.

I knew we were in for a treat when we attempted to make a reservation 24 hours in advance and had two choices, 4:30 or after 9:00.  We opted for 4:30.We were not disappointed.  We started by sharing the Dip Trio.  Because I'm allergic to seafood, the server immediately offered to increase our portions of hummus and guacamole.  Both were fantastic.  I went on to have the Crispy Buttermilk Chicken with a side of Colcannon Potatoes and Roasted Corn & Avocado.  My husband had the French Dip also with a side of potatoes.  I'm going to pull the trigger and say the potatoes are the BEST I've ever had.  My husband said his sandwich was an ""A"" (and he has had his fair share of French Dip sandwiches).  I had two glasses of Riesling while my husband opted for two Bourbon & Honey.  With tax and tip, our check came to $115.00 and it was worth every cent.The service was top notch.  We came in a side entrance and must have looked confused.  An employee immediately volunteered to show us to the hostess desk, and we were immediately seated.  Our server was attentive and friendly but not overbearing.Parking was easy with a parking garage attached, and the restaurant was classy but not stuffy. My husband has told me at least 3 times that Cameron Mitchell was opening a Hudson 29 in New Albany, but I didn't really understand what that meant.  Now I do!  It means that New Albany is finally getting a top notch restaurant!!!  I plan to visit Hudson 29 again and again.  I love this place!!!!!",Danielle A.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2006/5/15,"Everything was amazing. They have Open Table which was very convenient since I knew Fridays would be busy. But I also was able to put in there that it was my boyfriends birthday and they surprised him. It made the whole celebration much more special. We got the bottled cocktail (bloody orange margarita) and it was to die for. Appetizer was cheese filled butter rolls, I got the Gerber Farm Chicken, and we split the pineapple upside down doughnuts with a caramel sauce. The meal alone was fantastic but the service was incredible. If you ever go, make sure your waiter is Marshall(he normally works behind the bar) because he is the sweetest as well as has the best recommendations. Thank you Hudson 29 for a great birthday celebration! We shall be back",Faith M.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2008/4/15,"Great food and great service. The sushi was fantastic.  Fresh and delicious . Our party had the cheesy bread with marinara sauce, and it was superb. We also enjoyed the cheese board and rigatoni and sauce.I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a bite a bit upscale without being pretentious .",Beci B.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,2,2012/12/16,"I brought a good friend here for dinner and was utterly embarrassed at how disappointing it was, especially when Columbus has so many great places to eat.  We were both disappointed in the appetizer selection, but ordered a flat bread, which was nothing more than mediocre.  Then we both ordered the filet, which was good, but the side of tomato and feta did nothing for the steak.  It was seriously the worst $250 I've ever spent on a meal.  I think Cameron should consider going to Lindey's for their tornadoes, which consists of 2 4 oz filets, whipped potatoes, and crispy onions- all for a lower price than Hudson's mediocre filet dish and doesn't even compare in taste and quality.  Hudson 29- never again.",Millie N.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,4/22/16,"Hudson 29 quickly became one of my very favorite restaurants in Columbus. Everything about this restaurant was on point - great location, easy parking, friendly service, enjoyable ambiance, and, of course, delicious food. I had the buttermilk chicken sandwich and it was truly perfect - well-seasoned, crispy, and flavorful. They even got the tiny details right, like using a really quality slice of cheese; additionally, the side of roasted corn and avocado was great. While the price is a little higher than other options, the food and overall experience makes it completely worth it. HIGHLY recommend!",Timmy S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,5/15/16,"We made our reservations with Hudson 29 well in advance on Open Table but then I called a week before hand to add some people. They were ridiculously accommodating. (I called a few days later and changed the number back- which they did without question or criticism.) This was all on Mother's Day and OSU's graduation. On the day of our reservations I called to see if they would seat us early- they invited us to drop by an hour and fifteen minutes early and they'd get us drinks and seat us asap. We arrived 45 minutes before our reservation and we were seated immediately.Our food was mostly average- although the sushi and prime rib were fantastic! Our drinks were all spectacular! The whiskey and honey is delicious! The wait staff was also superb. The restaurant itself is so crisp and modern, yet rustic. The lobby has a gorgeous fireplace and plush armchairs. Overall, it was a pretty good experience!",Audrey M.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,12/19/15,"A Cameron Mitchell restaurant, Hudson 29 creates big expectations. It lives up to the reputation and the hype.Wedged into a retail and hotel complex on Upper Arlington's Lane Avenue shopping center strip, the venue stands out as an extremely high end restaurant for a suburban setting to have. Parking, normally a pain in this kind of store filled area, is a piece of cake due to street side meters and a parking garage behind the building. Loud ambiance, muted lighting, and a wrap around bar greet you as you walk in. The menu is ""ecletic,"" but not in a way where you think 'why the hell would anybody order this?' There are too many great choices, and the specials add to the dilemma. We found that we are going to have to return several times to get through the must-have items on the menu. Wife's comment was that everything on the plate was perfectly cooked and super delicious. She actually said that as we were driving out.Cool place, great pedigree, attentive staff, delicious food. One note of caution: it is pricey. The signature cocktails, while delightful, are ten bucks apiece. The wine list, as is the case with high end places, is on the expensive end. $17 burger, etc. Don't get me wrong, freshly prepared ingredients and ample portions are provided, but the final bill is steakhouse high. Worth it? Yes, indeed.Put Hudson 29 on your special night out list for dinner, your frequent list for lunch, and your regular stop for a cocktail bar.",Brian P.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,2001/3/15,"Visited on a Friday night that seemed less busy than expected.  We were a few minutes early for our reservation but were seated right on time. I was a tiny bit underwhelmed by the drink menu but pleased with the French 75 I ordered.  We ordered the cheese rolls for an app - they were just okay.  My husband's prime rib was awesome.  My rigatoni Bolognese was decent if a little boring. A delicious dessert of fresh hot donuts rounded out the meal nicely.I would have given Hudson 29 3.5 to 4 stars if not for the slow service.  Our server kept chatting up the tables in our section to the point that it took 20 minutes simply to pay the check.  He also seemed to be in the back for long stretches of time.  We expect more out of a Cameron Mitchell restaurant.",Melinda N.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,1/24/16,"My husband and I visited Hudson 29 shortly after they opened, we weren't fans. It's been a couple of years so we decided to give them another chance, and we're thrilled that we did. We started out with the con queso and chips, these were delicious. The queso has a chili in it that makes it superb! The chips have a hint of lime and sea salt, they were also very good. For dinner my husband had the Prime Rib and I chose the French Dip, both were great. The generous potions coupled with the flavorful choices made for a wonderful dinner. Not only was our food delicious but our server (McKinsey) was attentive and friendly and our drinks were mixed perfectly. We are so happy to have given Hudson 29 another chance.",Amber S.,,,,,,

A hidden gem.",Jarrod A.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,2,2011/8/15,"I've always been a big fan of Cameron Mitchell establishments in the past so the complete mediocrity of Hudson 29 was a big surpriseThe ambience and the service were both excellent but the food was pretty bad, especially for the price.  I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure most of our food spent some amount of time in a microwave before it was served.  The cheese stuffed roll appetizer was clearly not fresh (literally looked, felt, and tasted old) and had been re-heated which is a shame because if they were fresh, they probably would've been awesome.  The french dip sandwich was a complete flop.  Both the prime rib and the au jus were completely bland and the meat was almost cold when it arrived at our table.  I would've sent it back but we had to be somewhere after dinner so I really didn't have time.  I guess the microwave was full of mediocre rolls so the sandwich just got sent out as it was.  I honestly would've rather been eating a burger from Wendy's - and I'm not exaggerating for effect.  To be fair, the fries that accompanied the sandwich were awesome.  My wife had the steak and enchilada entree which was not even remotely worth $27.  It consisted of maybe 6 ounces of decent hanger steak along with a wildly unimpressive ""enchilada"" (tortilla with melted cheese - definite microwave work) and a corn, avocado, cucumber, and radish salad that was actually 99% corn with 2 pieces of avocado.  To recap: $27 for 6 oz. of meat, a tortilla with melted cheese, and a pile of corn.  There are obviously many good reviews of this place so maybe we just caught them on a bad night but I doubt we'll return to find out - don't really feel like dropping another $80-$100 only to find out I was right the first time.",Matt N.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2/13/15,"Love!!!  Hard to make choices!! Had the cheese stuffed butter rolls, shared Surf and Turf roll and sushi salad. Had enough room for pineapple upside down donuts and coffee. We'll be back!",Mariann S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,9/15/14,"I can't believe I keep forgetting to review Hudson 29. The main thing that gets 5 stars from me is the service. I go here on date nights, with kids, with out of town visitors and everyone is always thrilled. On my most recent visit I noted in the OpenTable reservation that I needed a GF menu and requested a table in a quieter part of the restaurant (the space between the two private dining rooms, FYI), and they did not need me to remind them. They actually seemed really pleased they could seat us where we wanted. Another reason I love it so much is that it's easy to eat here if you are Celiac or gluten-free for other reasons, even more so than other Mitchell establishments. They don't use as much dairy or butter in their food prep, which is another thing I'm currently avoiding for health reasons, and they always take good care of me. You can also get gluten-free fries here with no worries, they have a separate fryer. The servers always understand and are willing to help - on numerous occasions they have offered to find out if the nightly special is safe for me to eat, as well as soups of the day. Obviously the most important thing is the food itself, and it's always great. My favorite dish is the scallops, in which they somehow roast golden beets in a way that makes me want to eat them! My boyfriend and family are all fans of the prime rib, steak & enchilada, and the kids appreciate the fact that the kids burger is normal sized (but it still has a kid menu price!). Can't wait until the New Albany location is open next year so that I can go to Hudson 29 even more often.",Allison C.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,11/23/14,"First of all, let me just say that the food was delicious. I had the rigatoni bolognese, which was a fresh new take on a classic dish, and my boyfriend had the steak and enchilada, which was delightful. The Hawaii Five-O sushi roll was also out of this world. If I were to come back, it would definitely be to try the rest of the awesome menu.With that being said, however, there were a couple of things that made this restaurant a lot less successful to us than other Cameron Mitchell endeavors. First, the cocktails left a lot to be desired. Yes, they have fancy-schmancy house-created cocktails that sound delicious, but it's all basically a ruse to cover up how weak they actually are. My boyfriend's manhattan was almost all vermouth and bitters, whereas I had the weakest gin&tonic I have ever had in a restaurant in my whole life. This is a nice, expensive Cameron Mitchell restaurant, and, like The Pearl, they seem to be really skimping out on the quality of the drinks they offer to save a buck. And at $7-10 a cocktail, that's just ridiculous.Also, we felt really uncomfortable and rushed by the wait staff. They're all clean, friendly, and dressed to the nines, but we could tell immediately that they wanted to get us the hell in and out of there so they could flip the table for the next chump. I expect that sort of treatment at more casual places like El Vaquero and even Cap City Diner, but here, it was just ridiculous. Our waitress wanted to immediately know our whole order when we asked for drinks, and came back only seconds later with a strained smile when we told her we needed a ""minute"" to look over the entrees. Apparently, they are very literal there, because we were basically shoved in and out the door in under 45 minutes. Ridiculous.Though the food, decor, and ambiance were all fantastic, we felt really disappointed by the pathetically weak drinks and rushed service. For a $90 tab, I feel we should have gotten a lot more time and bang for our buck. I would recommend The Pearl and M instead--at least they give you some reasonable time to look over the menu.",Marissa C.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,10/25/15,Had brunch this morning with my wife.  Omelet was mediocre with little flavor and very limited texture - seemed almost artificial.  French toast was good but the sausage was mediocre with little flavor.  All in all a mediocre brunch for a premium price.  Coffee was very weak.  Service was good.  We can do much better elsewhere.,Steve B.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2/20/16,"I really enjoy the vibe Hudson gave me. My boyfriend took me here thinking I would really like the design of this restaurant. And I guess he was right. The foods were tasty. We ordered the Dip Trio, we started from the left and went to the right, till we reached the salmon. Oh my, it was more than delicious! It was orgasmic for my tastebuds! Our main courses were ribs and Today's Fresh Fish, it featured Broiled Arctic Char. I guess was in a seafood mood, because it was really good too! It was cooked to the perfect degree, and the flavor makes me feel like I'm having the fish fresh off the sea! My boyfriend had the ribs, the flavor was perfect, not too sweet or too barbecue..You know what I mean? The sides for the ribs were fries and coleslaw. It didn't seem too attractive for me until I see him eating the coleslaw bite after bite. Then I got curious, so I gave it a try. Well, surprisingly it was fresh and light. I actually liked it! I think it's not easy to make a coleslaw balanced in its flavors, it could easily get too saucy or the taste of cabbage takes over. Anyway, my experience was enjoyable! Hope this helps!",Tiffany Yu-Chun T.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,9/20/16,"Went there with two my two kids. First, I normally find Cameron Mitchell's restaurants to be very good overall and very consistent. He has grown his restaurant empire because of the right balance of quality and consistency.  However, I am beginning to get the feeling that things are becoming less consistent and service and attention to detail is clearly slipping.  If you expect to continue to grow your business and expand, it can't come at the cost of your current restaurant standards. I have noticed that the ""older"" Cameron restaurants (Cameron's, cap city, ocean club etc.) seem to still ""get it right,"" but the newer the ones (guild house, hudson 29, avenue) are clearly not of the same ilk as the others.  I can't say the food is not good, because it is, but is just doesn't seem to be ""as good"" as the mainstays.  The service I will definitely say is not nearly as good as the originals.  I think it is because the newer places are trying to be younger and ""hipper"" than the older establishments.   Not sure if anyone is looking at things in totality, but my personal experience at the newer places have just not been great.  Nothing has been horrible, but when I dropping a couple of hundred dollars on dinner, I expect better (or at least I have an expectation to meet the standards that I have come to expect from the ""older"" Cameron establishments. ) Perhaps this is the new norm for opening up pricey, hip, cool restaurants, but it sure seems like a disappointment to me.  Don't lose track of your roots and the simple things that got you to where you are by trying to be the next, coolest, hippest place to dine. It's not working.  Hudson 29 was average to good.  They were slow that night and the service was clearly not good.  Not attentive, took a long time to get someone to initially stop by, then long waits for drinks, orders, and getting the check.  I am flexible and if they were busy that is one thing, but they weren't, and call it either poor management, poor staff training, or both.  Either way, it's not acceptable for a higher end restaurant to not provide at least a reasonable level of customer attention (even if they are busy, and this case it wasn't.).  The food was fine.  I am noticing things on the prices that are getting a bit ridiculous.  A find a French fries are $6?    That's a bit ridiculous.  It's a decent portion, but common, $6 for what is a large russet cut up and fried!?  I'm not a cheap person, but things are starting to look excessive to me in certain things on the menu.   There are lots of choices out there and I will continue to support the Cameron restaurants, but i am beginning to wonder if they aren't in such a rush to grow and expand and be the coolest new place, that they aren't seeing the pitfalls of not doing it the right way.  I gave Hudson 29 three stars for being good.  Not great. The food was a solid three stars.  The service was 1+/2-.",Brian F.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2002/9/15,"I went to Hudson 29 for lunch with a pretty big group - I think there were 17 of us.  The hostess and all servers were excellent.  The food was top notch. Super  convenient free garage parking attached to the restaurant. My only complaint would be the lighting - it was especially dark in there, and the wood paneling didn't help to brighten up the place.  I bet it would be perfect for a romantic night out, though.I got the vegetarian black bean burger with colcannon potatoes - excellent.  I also tried a piece of my friend's sushi.  All the flatbreads got great reviews as well.  I would definitely return!",Samantha A.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,5/23/14,"Simply lovely. Cameron Mitchell does it again. The food and the service (both of which are equally important when dining out in my opinion) are always exquisite at his restaurants, and Hudson 29 is no exception. The layout of the restaurant is a little confusing, as there is a parking garage attached to the restaurant that connects to a side entrance to the restaurant. However, what appeared to be a waiter at a server's station noticed my lost look and not only took me to the reception desk, but looked up my table and took me to the group I was meeting up with. Now that is service when someone goes outside his job description to help a customer.Our waiter was extremely personable and knowledgable on the menu. We ordered what he called ""adult sodas"". They bottle their own soda and add alcohol to them. I had the bourbon cola and other ladies in my party ordered the grapefruit fresca. The bourbon cola had a nice balance between the bourbon and cola, and had a surprising hint of raspberry that also blended well. I had a sip of my friend's grapefruit fresca (hesitant to order it myself since I am not a grapefruit fan), and it was crisp and refreshing. I would order it in future visits.We had the four cheese rolls for our appetizer. It comes with three rolls and a side of marinara. The rolls were very good; not overwhelmingly cheesy or lacking.However, the marinara could use a little work in my opinion, but I still kept dipping!I had the pepperoni flatbread for my entree. I was pleasantly surprised. The crust was light but with good flavor, and the balance of cheese and pepperoni and taste of each was excellent. I look forward to going back and ordering a heavier entree (prime rib, steak, gerber chicken), as everything looked delicious as I scouted out what waiters were bringing other tables.For dessert, our table ordered the chocolate Texas sheet cake (comes with a scoop of vanilla graeter's ice cream) and the pineapple upside down cake doughnuts. The sheet cake is thin but takes up a whole plate, so definitely a shareable dessert. The pineapple upside down cake doughnuts come in a big pile (maybe 8 or so large doughnut hole sized balls) and have a side of caramel dipping sauce. Both were excellent. I do not like pineapple, but even I was a fan of the doughnuts (there are pineapple chunks baked inside the doughnuts). All in all, excellent food, supreme service, great atmosphere (though a tad on the loud side due to the restaurant being packed). I will definitely be back!",Jackie S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2003/3/15,"This review is a couple weeks late but I still remember all the deliciousness that is Hudson 29 :)  Max and I went here for lunch on Valentine's Day. The first thing I noticed was the lovely bar, it looked like a nice place to have some drinks and quiet conversation. I ordered a ""bottled cocktail"" which must be what the kids are into these days HA. It tasted like sophisticated juice so be careful with that (it was very good). We got the cheesy butter rolls which came out exactly as described and that was all I had ever wanted in that moment. If the words butter and cheesy and rolls put together does not get you excited, I don't know what will. They were amazing. By the time my entree came out I realized I had stuffed myself a little to much with the rolls, but alas, that didn't stop me from digging into the St. Louis rack of ribs I ordered. The meat fell off the bone, the coleslaw tasted fresh, and their fries are divine (small and crispy)! I took some of the meal home to devour later. This was almost a 5 star experience butler waiter disappeared for 20 minutes as we were waiting to ask for the check. The service is general was otherwise good.",Anna T.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,12/20/14,"There is a lot to like about Hudson 29. The location is great- Lane Ave business area, busy, friendly- very nice. The decor is all smoky leather and wood- feels quite refined. The service was lovely- our server was a true professional, and she was patient while our group of four (which included some older adults) took their time deciding what to get. Many positive attributes to this experience.Which is why I'm so bummed that the food and drinks were nothing special. Between the four of us we ordered red meat, fish, chicken, and a vegetarian dish. We also got a few starters. Everything was very blah- the chicken in particular was underseasoned, and the fish was not very fresh-tasting. Don't get me wrong- I don't think anyone was in danger of food poisoning or anything like that. I just think for the price, this food should be better. I'm sad to say some of the dishes tasted like an airport Chili's. The drinks were, as has been reported previously, disappointingly weak. I won't be going back unless the menu undergoes some reinvention.",Meg K.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,3/16/15,"Overall, really tasty!For starters, the parking situation is amazing. The parking garage is within walking distance to the restaurant and it made my night, how easy it was to park! (5 stars for that!) The ambience of the restaurant is great too, with dark woods and soft lighting. Very intimate. I also really like how the restaurant is divided into smaller 'rooms' bc it makes it less noisy. Our server was Hoda, and she was soft spoken but not extremely helpful. I ask lots of questions anywhere I go, and she wasn't as versed in the menu as I would have liked. Perhaps more training? Anyway, I decided upon the surf and turf sushi and the center cut filet. The sushi was AMAZING! I could have died right then! One of the best sushi dishes I've had anywhere- WELL DONE! With my filet, I decided on the tomato and feta (this is where her expertise could have really came into play.) The presentation was so so, and the tomato and feta was very liquidy and got on my steak. I asked for the steak to be a soft medium and Hoda referred to it as ""medium push."" It came out perfect! I cut into it and it was bursting with flavor and had a nice crunch to the outside which I love! I tasted the tomato and feta, and HATED IT. Weird combination of things in my opinion. I asked Hoda for another suggestion and she suggested I try the corn and avocado. No reason. So I took her suggestion at that, and tried that. Didn't hate it, but didn't enjoy it either. In my personal opinion that type of steak would be perfect with the classic potato, and that's what I should have paired it with. Overall, we definitely enjoyed our time there and most of the food I had was great. I will be back for sure.",hollie w.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,10/13/14,"Nicest dinner we've had yet in the Columbus area. It was also the priciest!We had a 7:30 pm reservation and once all four of us were present, we were seated on the patio. The area was smaller than the main dining room, but was also much quieter, which allowed us to have a proper conversation. It was quite pleasant.We started with a round of drinks, followed by an appetizer of meats and cheeses, which was very tasty. We then ordered our main courses, which were:Cheeseburger with Fries & Cole SlawPrime Rib (with potatos)and 2 orders of the Sole (fish) specialWhile munching on our meat and cheese, we struck up a running conversation with our waiter. He was young, (college aged), smart, funny and charming. He was also super attentive and had answers for any questions we threw at him. By the time dinner was over, we knew he lived on Campus, was Cuban in heritage and loved hot foods! We chatted about other restaurants,(he mentioned a Cuban place somewhere downtown). Another favorite place of his is Bakersfield, but he only goes there for the drinks... we told him he had to try the tacos they make there!The food arrived and everyone quieted right down. I had the Prime Rib, which was awesome. The filets of Sole were huge and very well cooked. The Cheeseburger was also great. No complaints here.We then split a couple of desserts, one was an apple crisp, the other was a dark chocolate cake, both had a little ice cream included.All told, this was a very pleasant meal, with the food and the service both rated very high!

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,2,2009/1/15,"oh Hudson 29...what follows is a graphic description of events, if you want to skip all of it there will be a TL;DR at the end. my friend and I were looking for a new place to try out and since CM owns like 99% of the places in Cbus and I had been to a couple CM spots we thought that Hudson 29 would be a good place to try. we had gone to Urban Sprawl for the day and had a couple of buns from the Hawaiian food truck but were certainly hungry by 530 (details are important here). I ordered the carrot ginger soup with quinoa and the french dip prime rib sandwich. the soup comes out and in true fancy fashion the waitress sits the bowl in front of me which at this point only carries the quinoa, ginger, onions and whatever other things went into the soup and as she sits the bowl down she tells me that it's hot. the soup was in a metal container with a spout, kind of like gravy bowl, she then pours it into the bowl. when she leaves i touch the bowl, not finding it too hot to touch, taste the soup and make a comment to my friend that the bowl was warmer than the soup. DUN DUN DUN soup tasted fine, i also had a pepsi and a water. about 10-15 minutes after soup food comes out, i take a bite of sandwich and realize that i am feeling SOOOO NAUSEOUS, i wait it out thinking maybe i drank too fast but then no i HAVE to get to the restroom where first bout of PROJECTILE VOMITING ensues. I come back to the table declaring that I feel better take another bite then immediately realize that was a negative on feeling better and i have to haul ass to the restroom again for the 2nd round of praying to the porcelain god. come out of the bathroom and my friend is finished her food, the waitress has left me some ginger ale because my friend told her i was sick. on the way home we have to stop on the side of the road, actually a Donato's parking lot (sorry Donato's) so I can avoid having the stench of vomit in my brand new car. So yeah, I spend the next few hours vomiting at home and feeling pretty crappy the rest of the night.I understand food presentation but I also understand food preparation. I'm 100% that the soup was not a temp where it should have been served, though since the symptoms were fast and furious it was likely Staph toxin induced and heating would not have helped but it would have made me feel better mentally...i will give it another try because of the wine deal and my friend enjoyed her food and let's be honest shit happens, i mean you can get food poisoning at home or your grannies' house but i thought i would share this experience with yelp..good things about the place: waitress was good and nice, half price bottles of wine on Sundays which was awesome, try the Zinfandel from BrazinTL;DR: food poisoning bad, half priced bottles of wine on Sundays and service were good",Kara M.,,,,,,

My wife had the red pepper soup and the salad with chicken and loved it.Our dinner companion had the reuben and was not very impressed. No kraut (braised sour cabbage as they described it on the menu) and served on rye instead of the marble rye listed on the menu.I ordered the Cheeseburger, I love a great cheeseburger and it's one of the things I measure a restaurant/grill by. I ordered it medium rare but the server told me they only cook it well done. I've never had that happen before but I decided to trust the server's recommendation.The burger was delivered and it was a hockey puck. overcooked and very well done and the fries were so salty they were virtually inedible.Overall a real disappointment. From the other reviews this seems to be out of the ordinary, so we will try it again, but this was as bad a first experience as I've every had in a Columbus restaurant, much less a Cameron Mitchell restaurant.",Marsh W.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,6/18/14,"I like it. Solid 3.5 stars. I have only been a few times for lunch. Food is good, service (like all CM restaurants) is exemplary. It is just a bit... pedestrian, I guess. Nothing stands outs. Even though I have eaten there 2 or 3 times, I can't tell you what I had to eat. I am unsure how to describe the inside, except for contemporary and dark. I just don't remember much- which is both good (because I must have had a solid experience because there is nothing specifically to complain about) and bad (because Cbus is filled with excellent dining experiences). Hudson falls solidly, and somewhat silently in the middle.",Kate H.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2005/10/14,"Hudson 29 measures up to what we've come to expect in a Cameron Mitchell enterprise.  There is a sophisticated urbane ambience which one feels from the moment you enter and is consistent with the homage to a NYC restaurant described on the menu.  Every CM restaurant has a theme, and so discriminating patrons will neither fault CM's M Restaurant for not having chicken fingers for the kids nor fault Cap City Diner for not having Lemon Chiffon for an elegant dessert.  The point is that not all restaurants are suitable for all occasions.  Obviously.  The service at Hudson 29 was equivalent to CM's high standards.  We had thrown the receptionist a major curve when we arrived just in time for our Saturday, 7:15 reservation, fully expecting to be promptly seated.  The place was SLAMMED with 4 or 5 parties waiting, the bar and restaurant clearly at capacity.  When we presented ourselves, the receptionist did not find our name on the reserved list; she did a a search and discovered that the reservation had been made for a week LATER (clearly my bad); without a pause or indication that it was My Stupid Mistake, she said she was pretty sure we could be seated within 30 minutes...and so we were.  BRILLIANT courteous and welcoming treatment by the staff of confused customers who might have been simply turned away.  (Under the pressure of the moment, it would have been far easier to have dismissed us!)  I've read all the Yelp reviews so far and see that I'm the fifth to comment on the fact that this is a high-decibel eatery.  Not merely noisy, I'm talkin' LOUD!So loud, in fact, that it was nearly impossible for my companion and me to have a casual conversation.  So loud, in fact, that we had to point at our choices on the menu, because our server wasn't able to hear us.  What this suggests is that the diners here were having a raucous good-time.  It also suggests that this is exactly according to the preparation and plan of the designer/owners of this establishment and is not a mistake, carelessness, or mismanagement by CM but in accordance with the conceptual intent of it being a High-Energy-Destination, which has to be a point to consider when making dinner plans in the future.  But when I'm looking for a serene and romantic dinner destination of CM-destinction, I'll probably select ""M"" or ""Ocean Club"" over Hudson 29!Another appreciated feature is the free, adjoining-garage-parking which will be a deal-breaker during Columbus' seasons of crappy weather.",John D.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,2006/12/14,"I had looked forward to trying this place out for a few months and finally went on a Monday night. Right away there was a big problem because me and my brother had a reservation for 8pm and even arrived early and yet the hostesses seemed to forget about us and seated 3-4 other walk in groups. Making us wait about 40 minutes when there should've been no wait, this is why you make a reservation in the first place. On a positive note one of the managers came and apologized and gave us 2 $7-10 appetizers and 4 mixed drinks on the house. This situation was handled well by the manager and it's not the reason I give them a 3 star rating. My brother ordered steak and enchiladas that the waitress recommended as a special dish but he said they weren't anything special. We are Mexican so we've been eating enchiladas for years. I had the pan seared scallops which they left searing too long and were slightly rubbery and dry. Even the vegetables didn't seem crisp or fresh to me. The drinks also were about average compared to similar American cuisine restaurants with a emphasis on mixed drinks made their own special way. I plan to give this place another try but I'm not in a rush to return, I give a restaurant two tries because many different factors might impact your dining experience. Maybe next I'll try their feature calendar entree and see if it is good or not. But Definitely order the cheese stuffed house baked butter rolls, they are probably the best thing I had all night and I would love to make this at home. Of course my opinion is just that, an opinion and give this place a try and maybe you can find something different that I did not.",Michael M.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,2,2006/9/15,"I am judging this harshly as this is a Cameron Mitchell restaurant (2.5 stars, if I could).  Everything was edible, but incredibly underwhelming.  My cocktail was meh.  The service was ok.  The food was a bit bland.  (Maybe I psyched myself out after reading all of the great reviews about the French Dip, and expected it to be some kind of once-in-a-lifetime moment.  I mean, it IS possible for me to be a bit too critical, since I get so excited about FOOD--perhaps it makes the ""letdown"" that much more severe?).  However, the donuts were REALLY GOOD, I gladly admit (good to see something deliciously unique on a menu, too).  Not a bad place, though I wouldn't go back anytime soon-- but worth trying at least once.  And if you like it more than I did, even better!",Anna H.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,1/29/16,"It seems like they are shooting for a 1/2 notch above Mitchells other restaurants.The two times I was there the food was very good.I think they are trying a little to hard to be trendy, adding things to dishes that don't need to be there.(please leave golden beets out of your salads) The service at the bar and by the waiters were excellent. I just think it is over priced.My wife and I went one day for lunch, no drinks, no desert and it was 65.00..its a nice place but its not 65.00 lunch nice.

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2004/6/14,"Cameron Mitchell never disappoints. Stumbled upon an apparently open Hudson 29 while en route to another restaurant in UA. Spontaneously changed our minds and decided to see if we could try our luck at Hudson 29 and I am so glad we did! The inside of the restaurant was decorated in a way that was warm and inviting but sophisticated nonetheless. The seating in the patio is a little tight. The back of my chair was right up against the back of the gentleman's chair seated behind me. It made for slightly uncomfortable maneuvering to get in and out of our seats. Nothing on the menu really seemed to catch my eye, and the menu didn't really seem to sell anything in particular or say, ""pick me, pick me!!!"" For a Monday night I thought maybe sea bass was a little too fancy (broke grad student speaking). I ordered the Rigatoni Bolognese and it was spot on!!! I was very pleasantly surprised. The noodles were wonderfully al dente and the braised beef on top was delicious! Don't worry, sea bass. I'm coming for you next time.",Christine N.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2007/4/16,"Delicious, hit the spot. I had the fish of the day, which was a seared tuna served with a yellow beet salad. It was nice and light and hit the mark on all cylinders. My wife had a prime rib French dip with coleslaw. The meat was so thinly sliced it melted in your mouth and paired nicely with both the au jus and the horseradish sauce. The coleslaw had just the right amount of creaminess. The meals were so good that definitely all plates served were cleared.",Tim G.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,6/14/14,"I brought an out of town friend here for apps and drinks on ""Cougar's Night Out"". It was a cool Friday night in June and the restaurant was very busy. The bar was full of young(ish) singles. As other reviewers have noted, this place is really noisy; don't plan on having an intimate, important discussion during the dinner rush. Hudson 29 has modern decor and is right in line with the look and feel of the other Cameron Mitchell joints in town. The price point is similar, too. It is definitely the new ""IT"" place in UA.We split the dip trio, I had the bottled Bourbon Cola, and she ordered the Bourbon & Honey. We enjoyed the food and drink and we enjoyed the atmosphere. Hudson 29 would be the perfect spot for a date or a special occasion dinner.",Adrianne B.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,1,7/20/15,"Met an old girlfriend for lunch to catch up, and we both expected to be blown away on our first visit but were surprised at lack of enthrallment with menu and design. Formal facade with casual execution. Cameron restaurants are always a little loud, but tend to fit with a ""lively vibe"" generally due to popularity - here I could hardly hear my friend chatting, plus hardly see her in the candlelight. Prices were high and couldn't really get a feel for the menu and what kind of a story they were trying to tell (asian/steaks/rigatoni/what?). In that case I always try to feel out the waiter obviously for suggestions - but even that was unsucessful. Not sure if he was new or didn't speak English or what, but not very knowledgeable. I'll give it a star because the rolls were BOMB. Otherwise, I'd suggest sticking with the other CM concepts that are proven.",Katherine M.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,4/19/14,"Cameron Mitchell knows how to serve up delicious, inventive food with amazing service! My friend and I decided to split the black bean burger with corn & avocado side dish and the roasted chicken and quinoa salad. They conveniently split everything for us in the kitchen. The burger was very flavorful and our side however, was a little undesirable...tasted like they used canned corn. The salad was absolutely delicious and the best part of the meal. Service was spot on the whole night! Make a reservation because it is crowded at all all times of day our bartender said!",Jamie S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,1,3/14/15,"This was my second visit, and will also be my last.  My friend and I went yesterday (which was a Friday) and found the bar area busy at about 5:30.  There was one empty barstool at the end.  I stood so my friend could sit down.  We ordered glasses of wine and asked about the booths around the bar and were told they were all reserved.  The red wine was very warm, probably 75 degrees.  So while we were looking at the overpriced menu, the bartender proceeds to tell us that the barstool my friend is sitting in is also reserved and the person just stepped out for a minute.  Really?  Since when do places reserve bar seating?  Nobody was sitting there and the guy in the next seat didn't say anything.  I went from disappointed to offended.  I expressed my dissatisfaction for the wine temperature and their ""guest services"" and we promptly left.",Clint M.,,,,,,

The drinks were great--thoughtful, well mixed. The four cheese rolls were not as amazing as advertised (we all thought they tasted like Bosco sticks that they serve in school lunches). But the Sushi was WOW! I think if there was a real negative, the vibe was a little confusing. I could not tell whether one was suppose to wear casual wear or dress clothes, or if it was a family place or for young adults, or older folks. But, maybe that's a good thing?

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,5/23/14,"The ambiance and decor of Hudson 29, combined with the amazing service is what most impressed me with the restaurant, not so much the food. The food is decent but not, in my opinion great, which is what someone might expect from a ""top notch restaurant"". The menu items are creative, yes however nothing (expect the dessert balls) that leaves you with the feeling this-is-one-of-the-most-spectacular-meals.When dining with my boyfriend there last Saturday, we split the chicken lollipops, and he ordered the prime ribs and I ordered the Hawaii sushi roll with a side of quinoa salad. The chicken lollipops were good but we found everything else to be okay but nothing exceptional. However, the price point was good, which we left spending around $74 with drinks included.One thing I can't reiterate enough is the service. The managers and GMs and staff are dressed to the nine. Everyone is extremely clean cut, professionally looking and extremely knowledgeable about the menu, it is evident they they are well trained and make quality customer service a priority.I would recommend trying the restaurant as it is receiving a lot of buzz and like I said the service is phenomenal. However, I recommend going more for an after work drink with friends rather than a date night or nice intimate dinner location. There are tvs around the bar and therefore many people come to watch games (or horse races like last weekend) and so people can get a little loud and rowdy.Hope this helps!",Ryann G.,,,,,,

He was great at offering recommendations, knew the menu inside out, and worked around allergies in our group. I recommend the arugula salad to start--A flavorful vinaigrette and goat cheese make this a scrumptious choice. The sushi was good as were the flatbreads. Also, get the pineapple donut holes. They are made to order and extremely satisfying. I recommend this place for date night, girls night out, or pretty much any occasion.

I was seated and saw my client sitting in lobby so went to fetch her. Neither meal was impressive. Mine was wrong and the server realized and got me the corrected meal. I was excited to get the chicken salad with kale. I love CBC  pulled chicken salad, but unfortunately this was mostly greens with a smattering of chicken and a few bits of beets. A very disappointing first visit and didn't impress my client-except for the parking. I am sure I will visit another time and sit at the bar, but will not bring anymore clients.",Terri M.,,,,,,

Her drink was better than mine , mine tasted like a very tart fruit drink. For dinner I got the prime rib and she got the black bean burger. I had high hopes for the prime rib based off of other reviews and it was good but not great. My mashed potatoes I figure were hand mashed as there was a solid chunk of potatoe about an inch and a half long that wasn't cooked all the way through.  Her black bean burger she said was good but not as good as bar145. The fries were awesome but they're still just fries. We ended with the pineapple upside down donut holes. These were pretty awesome, warm and sugary with a caramel sauce to dip.

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,2/15/16,"Service was horrible. We had an early dinner at 4pm on Valentine's Day.  The place was not terribly busy but it was nearly full. Entrees were served when we were not even half way through our salads. The server said sorry it was kinda quick but she didn't want our food getting cold so she brought it over. (So instead it sat on our table getting cold while we finished our salads. Could have left it under the warmer.) The very small table we had made it very awkward to fit all of the dinnerware in the space. I thought this was really lousy for such a high end place and I was irritated by it. While we ate, our server disappeared for long periods of time without checking on us. When we were finished it felt like an eternity before she returned to offer a box and bring the check. Then our credit cards sat in view while she walked past and loitered by the kitchen. At this point it seemed she had no intention of trying to give good service. Unfortunately for her, I am a good tipper. I always give 20% unless there is a problem. So with two glasses of wine, two salads, and two pricey entrees, she missed out on a $20 tip from us. Do you ever feel like a server kinda ""sizes you up"" based upon things like, if you seem inexperienced about wine choices, mispronounce items on the menu, your physical appearance, etc. This is how I felt. Shouldn't judge a book by its cover. We eat out a lot. Usually at less snooty places where they don't charge $40 for a steak with no side dish or salad included. The food was tasty, although the horseradish in the mashed potatoes was a bit much. It's a shame when you get a poor server and it creates an unfavorable first impression.",Jane S.,,,,,,

I had high expectations for this Cameron Mitchell establishment, since I've had pleasant experiences with their other restaurants in the past. Unfortunately, Hudson 29 fell short of my expectations. The food was good, although nothing particularly special struck me about them. I ordered the dip trio to start, and had the St. Louis BBQ ribs for main course. The portions were very generous, and I had leftovers even after splitting my entree with a friend. Service seemed slow for a Wednesday evening. Our server boxed our food and had even labeled the entrees on the boxes, but somehow I went home with my friend's leftovers instead. Overall, for the price and experience I expected better.

Tuna tartare on a a baguette was the best tuna I've ever had. We had shrimp taquitos as an appetizer, they were also great. The scallops, prime rib and steak enchilada are all top of the line. The young man behind the bar knew more about liquor than the rat pack. The homemade caramel sauce with the donut holes were the best dessert I had in years. If I could change one thing....lower the prices by 5-7%  The main dishes were not quite worth the money, but everything else exceeded expectations.",Andrew W.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2004/2/14,"The restaurant is beautiful. The staff was very friendly. Went on opening night and there are a few kinks to work out, like the fire alarms going off a few times. I had the Rigatoni Bolognese and my fiancÌ© ordered the steak and enchilada. The enchilada was fine but the steak was the star. Tender, flavorful. Rigatoni was excellent too. Shrimp taquitos were tasty but not enough food for the money. A little on the pricey side, as expected. Will definitely go back at some point.",Luke M.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,11/30/15,"Good food. The sushi is great. However, their drinks are a bit weird. The Lemonade is gross and they make their own grenadine. It has a pomegranate flavor and it's not good. Nice atmosphere though.",Rebecca M.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,6/24/14,Pricey but  worth it.  Dressy atmosphere and a lil noisy.  The sweet  juicy scallops were on point.  Recommended! Also adding to the ambience was the summer thunderstorm and rain ;),Ana P.,,,,,,

Great location right on Lane, great ambiance, and fantastic food/drink.Nice bar area if you have to wait. Service is outstanding from door to exit. Classy experience. I'm very critical on food and everything was great. Scallops, salmon, steaks, ribs, sushi, and dips were all great. Will be back for another session.",Jonathon S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,4/23/14,"Went there on Saturday night at 9. We had to wait for some time, anticipated wait was 1.5 hrs but we didn't have to wait that long. The bar was crowded! The place is elegant, chic.. Kind of place where you would take your guests. We ordered hummus dip, black bean burger with corn avocado salad - both were pretty good. It's expensive place- so be prepared. Ambience outweighs food. I haven't tried their cocktails yet- but they look good on the menu. The service was really slow on that day.",Minu L.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,5/18/14,"Another Cameron Mitchell success! Ambiance, use of space, and seating is amazing.

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2006/8/14,"Clientele is upper middle class, so it feels fancy, and there are a lot of cougars. The service is great, cocktails are pretty good albeit their cocktail menu was somewhat limited, but I'm sure the bar can make almost anything. Food was decent, pricey but you're paying for the unique atmosphere. Parking in parking structure is convenient. Waited for an hour and a half at 730 Friday night for a table for 4 as a walk in but they have places to sit and stand out by the hostesses station, and they're very attentive to you, getting drinks to you from the bar. We had a good time chatting over drinks on the couches near the fire place while we waited that hour and a half so it was no big deal. 3 bourbon honeys and a French dip sandwich and splitting a tuna tartare appy ran you up to ~$50, the sandwich was good and filling.",Buhbee L.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,3,2012/4/15,"Arrived just after 4 pm. Nobody at the front desk so I assumed it was seat yourself at the Bar. So my Son and I sat in a small two seat table next to the bar. Waiter arrives and asks if we were seated. I told him that nobody was upfront so we sat down. Usually Bar areas are self seating. Guess I was wrong. Brought us water and menus. Took drink order and I asked if there was a Happy Hour Bar Menu? He told us he would have to get permission as I guess the sit down area of the Bar is not actually the Bar. I guess he got permission and handed us a Happy Hour menu.We ordered the Happy Hour St Louis Ribs $12 which consisted of 4 bones 2 large meaty ones stacked on two lean ones. We each ordered the Cheeseburger plate which included 1 side. I chose the mashed potatoes and my son the fries. $16 each. Total bill was $62 including 1 iced tea and a Dirty Martini.  With Tip $72 for two Cheese Burgers, 4 ribs, 1 House Gin Dirty Martini and an Iced Tea. There were more employees than customers at the time. The Cheese Burgers were well prepared and very good. Ribs were better than most. Maybe its just me but for a $72 Happy Hour I expected better service and a little better value. Beautiful interior, clean and spotless.",Russ J.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2007/6/14,"Really enjoyed it! We sat on the patio, so avoided the darker inside and noise that other reviewers have commented on. My husband and I weren't actually that excited by the menu, other than the sushi options, it seemed fairly average. We got the shrimp taquitos to start and they were good, but not great. But our entrees were delicious - prime rib and sea bass were both so good. We also got a side of tomatoes and feta - simple but amazing. Dessert was doughnuts (we could have shared) and strawberry shortcake - both were very good also. Some service miscues - had to ask for the side when our entrees arrived, and they brought out the wrong dessert for me but quickly fixed the error. All in all, a great experience.",Jenny F.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,2,2012/11/14,"First off, I would like to say that I DO NOT recommend this place for people with allergies. I made reservations here on a Friday night for my boyfriend's birthday. They were very busy. The hostess acted like we were bothering him. He did not greet us at all, after standing there a few minutes while he was helping someone else, he turned to us and just stared and waited for us to talk. I told him we had a reservation and he just shoved a beeper in our face, didn't say anything. About 10 minutes later we were sat in quite possibly the worst table in the restaurant, right next to the bar AND the kitchen. It was incredibly loud and there were drunk people being obnoxious. It was difficult to even have a conversation without shouting. I have both a nut and shellfish allergy. This menu is really horrible for people who have allergies, as none of the items on the menu list all of the ingredients in them. I had to ask the waitress to tell me what was in several different meals, only to find out there were some sort of nut in most of them. She seemed annoyed to have to list all of the ingredients to me, and said ""we can make it to order if you want without nuts"" but I don't like to do that just in case they get it wrong and I don't know until I start eating it. I finally settled on the black bean burger and fries, only to find out the fries are cooked in peanut oil! First of all, what high end restaurant uses peanut oil? And second of all, what restaurant uses peanut oil and doesn't give a warning on the menu????? Had I known they use peanut oil I would have never even come to this restaurant to begin with.  So I settled on the side of potatoes. However, half an hour later my meal comes out with a side of fries. They had to remake my whole meal while my boyfriend let his meal sit there and get cold because he refused to eat without me. The person who brought our food out showed us the order did say ""nut allergy"", basically to make sure we still tipped the waitress well, but other than that we didn't get an apology or any money off of our food, which I normally never expect, but serving someone something they clearly stated they are allergic to at the very least deserves an apology from a manager. Besides this incident, the food was just okay, nothing special and not worth the hefty prices. They were basically meals we could have gotten anywhere for a fraction of the price. This place most definitely does not live up to Cameron Mitchell standards in my option. We love many other Cam Mitchell restaurants so I think we will stick with some of the older, better run restaurants instead of returning to this restaurant or any of the other new Cam Mitchell ones. It seems they are now focusing on opening as many restaurants as possible, instead of focusing on the quality of their restaurants and food.",Jenn S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,7/24/14,"Great addition to the CM family.   A hot spot!  Food was very good. I started with the BBQ chicken flatbread. Then I had the rigatoni. I was hesitant to order an Italian dish but I read previous reviews that it was good. And it definitely was!  A bit pricey, but worth it.  reminds me of Houston's/ j Alexander's.",Elizabeth S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,1,2011/7/14,"Went to Hudson 29 for lunch the other day and was disappointed with the food. Ordered a red pepper soup, that was cloyingly sweet. Strike one! We also ordered the cheese stuffed house baked butter rolls. If those don't sound enticing, I don't know what does! No big deal. Strike two! We then split a California roll and a $13 black bean burger with the ""roasted"" corn. California roll, nothing special. Black bean burger, bland and unroasted ""roasted"" corn. Strike three! At one time, we were big fans of anything Cameron Mitchell, but that changed several years ago. I now feel that they serve mediocre food at a premium price, which in turn, drives up prices at other restaurants.",Theresa C.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,11/23/14,"Date night!!! Whoooo hooo!! This place overall was great but was slightly confusing for me and the hubs.I'll start with the decor. Very date nightish and sexy. All though the overall feel is ""cozy by the river"" with dark wood paneling, burnt orange booths and huge ivory drum shades, I couldn't help but feel I was in the 60's. The entry is beautiful and very inviting when you walk in and the feel is very cozy. So mid-century modern decor with a touch of 2014?!As for the menu, it's sort of generic and boring, which is unexpected for a Camron Mitchell restaurant. When I studied menu design, this is not what they taught us, but the new trend seems to be a little of this and a little of that- not very cohesive and very odd to me. Anyways, we started out with the butter rolls. Basically, pizza rolls and just very strange to me when the inspiration for this place comes from the Culinary Institute of America, pretty sure they didn't teach that in culinary school but whatev's. So, I had the Pan Seared Scallops and it seems they forgot the mention the abundance of greens on the plate which basically make this a salad. It was great, but I wasn't looking for a salad. Huge chunks of avocado and the golden beets were the best part. My scallops were terribly under seasoned and the croutons were soaked with pure oil. But overall this was a pretty delicious dish. I also ordered a side of the colcannon potatoes and yummm, they were delish! My love had the ribs and they were pretty good. They weren't falling off the bone but the slaw served with them was the perfect balance of freshness and acidity. The other couple we were with with ordered the Texas sheet cake for desert. I could not believe this was on the menu. Talk about 1960's!! It wasn't that good anyways. As for the service. The hostess were a bit stuffy when we walked in but what else is new. Our server, Quentin was very knowledgeable and overall a great server and any other server that came to our table was very friendly. There were honestly at least 5 managers on duty but not one stopped by to ask how everything was, which is always nice gesture. Last thoughts...Even though the menu is here and there, the atmosphere, service and food is great. It does throw me off for being a date night spot with such boring food- but boring food done pretty good! We will be back!",Lesley M.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,1,2010/2/14,"LOUD. LOUD. LOUD. yes, I'm shouting and you will too if you want to be heard. This place is hazardous to your hearing and the food is so-so and radically overpriced. If you want the driest most tasteless Ruben in Columbus for a mere $17, then this your kind of place. My friend had the chicken and ribs. The ribs were good but the chicken was dry and tasted like it was a leftover from a couple days before.",Joe W.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,2,10/20/14,"We've tried this place twice now and the second might have been worse than the first. The buttered cheese rolls were stale, glorified garlic bread. They were hard (not on purpose) rolls with a little bit of melted cheese on top and served with marinara. Really gross, don't try them! Salmon was over salted and very basic. I could have made it better at home. The scallops were rubbery and bland. The roasted corn and avocado side was delicious and the only thing we were able to finish. So for a hefty bill, we only enjoyed the one side dish and we will not be returning. This is definitely my least favorite CM restaurant.",Julia V.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,4/25/14,"another Cameron Mitchel hit!! went on a whym with my wife on a friday night at 7, no reservation, but we wanted to try Camerons newest endeavor. we were told our wait time would be 60 -70 minutes, however we were seated in less than 35. The decorvreminded me of New York or something I would find in Chicago, warm, rustic and inviting.  The menu had a bit of everything, my wife has a gluton alergy and had the gluten free cheeseburger, while I had a Ruben.  Both were fantastic, service was amazing, Aaron was our server and he was great. can't wait to go back.",Steve R.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,2,2008/3/14,"Came here last night with a group of 7. 2 of us had been here before, the others were anxious to try. Although were were here early (5:45) as only time available for a group our size before 9, the place was packed.  The food for everyone was just fine, typical for a Cameron's restaurant but nothing really exciting. It was all well executed. Good sushi, salads etc. but our service was awful. After menus were provided, our sever showed us where the drinks were listed and said he would give us some time to look. 15 minutes later he reappeared. We ordered 1 soda, 1 cocktail, 3 glasses of wine and a beer.  The soda came out first, which is typical as it doesn't come from the bar. Next trip, the cocktail shows up. Few more minutes elapse and the beer and 2 glasses of wine arrive, but not the other glass. (It was red - maybe they keep that at a different bar?!)  Finally, 15 minutes  and 4 trips later our entire party had their drinks. Cut to the check. We asked for the checks to be split by couples.The Checks arrive  and everyone who had ordered a glass of wine had been charged the full bottle price. We point it out and 3 checks corrected and paid- no problem. Now we all have our change back, but he has forgotten to take the 4th check and correct it. He apologizes, takes the fourth check and returns it with the full bottle price on it again! At this point we are beyond exasperated and cannot believe the waiter did not look at the check to make sure the problem was corrected. The sad thing is, all of us live in Upper Arlington and were thrilled to have somewhere new to eat and drink. I don't think any of us will be returning any time soon",Lisa H.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,3/29/14,"Hudson 29 was outstanding.  We have waited a long time for Cameron to open a restaurant in U.A. and he did not disappoint.  We were impressed from the second that we walked in tonight.  The atmosphere was tasteful, comfortable yet sophisticated.  Lighting and decor were spot on.  The staff was impeccably styled, incredibly knowledgable about the menu and drinks.  They were very attentive and well trained.  Catherine made our experience at the bar as special as it might have been if we had a the best table in the house.   The menu has a wide variety of great options to experience.  We ordered the Roasted Red Pepper soup, Arugula salad, Steak & Enchilada entree and Beignets for dessert and loved all of them.   We look forward to making Hudson 29 our new local favorite.  Congratulations on a great opening day!",Heather M.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,2008/7/14,"Went here last night for a special dinner with my sister. Parking in a garage behind the restaurant, which was convenient. No reservations, but it was about 7 on a Wednesday. Still, fairly crowded. Seated right away, water immediately brought to table. The cocktails sounded intriguing, so my sister and I each had one from their ""sparkling"" menu. Not extraordinary, so maybe wine would have been a better choice. We ordered the meat and cheese appetizer. Quite tasty, although no explanation was given at service to point out the various components, which might have been helpful. Then we each thought the prime rib and mashed potatoes colcannon was what we wanted. Our entrees came out quite quickly, as the appetizer was not even half finished, but the food runner didn't seem to care. Later, Brittany, our sever, apologized that the entrees came out so quickly. We actually ended up not finishing all of the appetizer. But believe me, the prime rib was juicy, seasoned perfectly, and one of the most delicious prime ribs we've had anywhere. I asked for mine to be more on the rare side, and it was. It came with a lovely horseradish sauce that enhanced the flavor of the rich beef. The potatoes were fine, a good enough side dish. Brittany contained to check on us, and our water glasses were refilled periodically. Finally, we decided to split a dessert. Choices were Texas Sheet Cake, Strawberry Shortcake and Pineapple Upside-down Cake doughnuts with a caramel dipping sauce. We opted for the doughnuts, and they came out fresh and hot. A great choice with the caramel. A perfect ending to the evening. Definitely a nice option for an Upper Arlington location, although it tended to get noisy as others have mentioned. Special meal for a special occasion.",Debbie P.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,5,9/27/14,"I love all of Cameron's restaurants but I now am especially fond of Hudson 29.  There is a warm but festive feeling as you walk in to the ideally squared bar area, ideal for people watching and meeting others, yet more private seating towards the back or by the wine area. You must try the ribs that truly fall off the bone if you like to eat them like a lady with knife and fork as I do. Best ribs in Columbus by far. The Hawaii 5 O sushi roll is one of the best rolls I have had anywhere. Staff is expertly trained with immaculate grooming as in all of Cameron's restaurants.

Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,1,9/22/14,"Such a disappointment.  The food was so-so and drinks were very pricey. But the worst thing about my visit was the service and overall atmosphere.  There was a group of us celebrating a birthday. We made an early reservation for 5pm. We arrived promptly yet the table wasn't set up yet. Wasn't a problem, got drinks at bar. Once we sat down the rest of our party arrived. Took about 20 minutes before they were served drinks. Dinner was ordered and served promptly. However we were then told by our server that our table was reserved for another party at 730pm and our checks were brought to the table. What? We thought we had the table for a while longer because at this point we hadn't even had dessert. We felt we were being pushed out. Our table was being bussed while we were still sitting there! Unprofessional and very pretentious.  Will not be going back or sending friends there on a recommendation.",Barbara R.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - Upper Arlington,210,4,4,2005/5/14,"Visited this restaurant for the first time on 4/28 for lunch.  The food is great and the atmosphere is warm and inviting.  The best part was our waiter, Demond.  He noticed that we were celebrating a birthday and even noticed the birthday person's name on the greeting cards we were giving her.  He brought a delicious dessert to our table with 4 plates and forks for all of us to share.  This was presented to us with a candle (mercifully, no singing) and was on the house.  We were truly touched and amazed.  Demond made our experience and it says a lot for his training and for the restaurant that he was so observant.   All in all I'd go to Hudson 29 again and would recommend it to others.  Only complaint?  A bit pricey but the menu does have a full spectrum of offerings.",Patricia B.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,4,2012/8/17,"I have been here a couple of times, most recently sitting at the bar for dinner. The food is consistently done well and with quality ingredients and good flavors. On this visit I had the Blackened Snapper served with a Kale and Brussels Sprout Salad. The snapper was perfectly cooked and the salad had a great balance of flavors to contrast the spice on the fish. I am not a big Kale fan, but I would order the salad as a stand alone meal.For dessert I ordered the carrot cake, which was a very large slice that was covered in a rich cream cheese frosting, I almost ate the whole thing, which was probably not the best idea, but it was a perfect finish to the meal.The restaurant has a nice ambiance and a professional service staff, it is a neighborhood spot that has raised the bar.",Susan A.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,5,2009/6/17,"Simple menu items, executed very well.First visit, I started a the house salad. Light mustard vinaigrette w shaved parm and croutons that were the best crouton ever. Crusty bread. I've been back and tried:Burger-Very tasty. It's a tad pricy for what it is, but still a solid bet.Prime Rib sandwich-if you want to indulge with a classic, try here. Tender, thinly shaved prime rib. Au jus and whipped horseradish. Took my 2nd half home to hubby.Fish sandwich-I tried a bite if a friend's, wis. Totally getting that next time. Chinese Chicken Salad-The ramen noodle definitely adds something to this. So light & refreshing. And if you are staying for dessert try the sheet cake or the pineapple upside down donuts.

Their cheese stuffed rolls with marinara app.  They are SO soft, buttery and delicious that we each get an order (3 average sized rolls for $10) and make that our meal for lunch.  We go to this location since it's a little closer and service is always decent even if the host/hostess always seems to be a weird exchange regardless of who is greeting.

You can't get a steak and they've a lot of soups and salads. We started out with the Dip Trio app, loved the oily chips and the fresh tasting guacamole. The hummus and the trout seemed a little off. Had the red pepper soup with croutons and a teeny-tiny (seriously eency-weency) dollop of goat cheese in the middle, what I tasted of the cheese was delicious and a tad more (please?) would've made a perfect soup course. Entrees were a moist roast chicken with colcannon and a heavenly tangy reduction. Companion had the French Dip. His roasted cornwith tomatoes, avocado and radish slices was surprisingly distinctive. A well toasted bun for the sandwich would've been perfect. The toffee bread pudding?

The fish of the day was swordfish, so I went for that.  Came out very good, but not the best I've had; that's not really a knock on it because it was tasty, but I've had better.  I swapped sides for the roasted corn/avocado mix and it was awesome.  No dessert this time because we were full.  Overall, pretty good experience.

Recommend the chicken sandwich, cheeseburger, surf & turf roll, volcano roll. Great attentive service as well from all staff!",Stephanie G.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,3,2002/1/16,"Service was great.  Preston was very interactive and very friendly.  True hospitality.  Hence the three star, otherwise it would have been two.  The food was good, bordering on very good, but WAY over priced for the quality and presentation.  Atmosphere was solid; good lighting and music volume.  This was a good meal and experience at $20 a person, not $35 a person.The more I think about it and the family talks about it, it was overall disappointing.  My Blood Orange margarita tasted like a cheap pink grapefruit carbonated soda.  Zero alcohol taste.  It just stinks that 20 mins after leaving, no one has anything nice to say about the experience,  besides how nice Preston was.",Josh K.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,5,11/25/15,"Picture this:You're hanging out with one of your besties and begin to feel the hangry pains surfacing. It's Saturday, and not quite in the mood for breakfast yet lunch doesn't seem appropriate just yet. You want to try a new place but don't feel like driving all over the city. Easton is going to be a mad house, and it's a game day so downtown is out for what you're looking for. You head to the Yelp app hoping for inspiration and then you see it. Hudson 29. You've heard great things from Bryant M. and Keith M. about the bottled cocktails and dinner entrees. You quickly download the menu, anxiously anticipating the results. You examine the menu hastily. And then - you see itPineapple upside down donuts. You swing the car in drive and take off!______________Hudson 29 is beautiful restaurant that is perfect for fancy occasions and weekend brunches. After crushing over the bar with high cushion sits, bitters, and bourbons, we were lead to our booth with wine bottle openers on the outside. Our waitress was an absolutely perfect - courteous and quirky. She answered all my random questions, and surprised us with a bottle of the soon to be released Manhattan. We ordered our drinks, donuts, and entrees. I selected the chef's omelet which was filled with shrimp and goat cheese - delish. My drink was every bit of delightful and I was pleasantly surprised by the smooth flavor the bottled cocktail provided.And the donuts, oh these sweet morsels were accompanied with a delicious housemade caramel sauce that should really have a dedicated day to honor the greatness that it is.",Robin C.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,3,12/26/16,"Relatively frequent patron of several of the Cameron Mitchell restaurants in town. Maybe I am jaded to expect more out of the CM family. This was just OK as far as we were concerned.  We had a party of 6 adults finally enjoying a night out without kids before the insanity of Christmas reached Defcon 1. The service would have been fine if we were at Longhorn, I expected a little more finesse from a restaurant of this caliber. The food too was just ""goods"" not great. I will say that the cocktails were great and the service we received at the bar before being seated was great. Next time we will go to The Barn or another CM location or save a ton of money and have Mellow Mushroom next door.",Mark D.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,2,8/13/17,Hudson is ok however it's like anything else in New Albany everything is just kind of overpriced for average food . If you drive like 10 minutes you can get equal food if not better for a lot less price. however I understand if I was putting a restaurant in the middle of a lot of rich people I would do the same thing,Todoubled ..,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,3,7/26/17,The cocktails are nice. My wife enjoyed the Blackened Snapper. Or friend's printer rib was good. The sushi can be described as Insipid and tasteless.,J M.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,1,2006/9/17,Really have no idea why I continue to come here. The wait and greeting staff are rude and we do not get treated the way we expect to from a Cameron Mitchell's restaurant. Terrible!,Ryan L.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,4,2006/10/15,"Good experience in a great location.  Not an everyday eatery but a nice upscale dinner at best. The service was amazing, the food was delicious, the ambiance was amazing and the patio was perfect for a nice day. We ordered a few hand crafted drinks that we both enjoyed. We got an appetizer that was unique,  shrimp Taquitos.  Usually I think of Taquitos as a corn tortilla rolled with a filling but not here, it was lightly breaded shrimp with a pop of flavor. Interesting and a huge risk with that name. I ordered the Salmon.  It was served with a couscous salad of kale, raisins,  almonds and radish.  The salmon was perfectly grilled but paired with the couscous salad it made me want a sauce. It was rather dry.  My husband got the prime rib that was initially overcooked for medium. It was very tough and hard to chew. We get prime rib medium at other establishments and got a slightly pink throughout and the server made us know that the chef said it was medium rare we wanted. Either way, they quickly resolved our concern and happily enjoyed the prime rib thereafter. I am looking forward to my next experience at Hudson 29 and ready to try something new.",Mary B.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,3,2009/1/16,"There were four of us on a rainy Wednesday for dinner. I had read the reviews of people who have written more than five (I never bother with the ""one and done"" reviewer.  We had a very good server **** who explained that the restaurant was named Hudson for the Hudson River. If you go you will hear it all. We shared the outstanding three dip appetizer recommended by the server. A scoop each of guacamole, hummus and smoked trout with crisp tortillas. Since the portions are large we chose to split the misnamed Reuben * ($17.00) with a side of roasted corn & avocado salad *. The corned beef is house made and rather dry with an unpleasant strange flavor. The bread was a marble rye. The braised sour cabbage was a disappointment in texture and flavor. I never found the swiss cheese. There was generous amount of corned beef. It looked good. The corn in the salad was not fresh and sweet. Our friend tried the Cantonese Chicken & Noodle Salad, she found it quite oily and mentioned it to the waitress. So, go for the good service and ambiance. It is a sports bar and the tvs are on. From my seat in the dining area the tv was obvious. I might go back for happy hour to have a drink and the $12.00 dip trio. Stick with the appetizers.",Holly G.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,4,2005/9/17,Our family loves this place. I like that you can get a sandwich or a steak or sushi. The drinks are always on point and sometimes you can snag a last minute reservation on a Saturday or Friday night. We come here for birthdays and get a free dessert which is nice. The chicken sandwich is fantastic and enough for two. I like the sushi and my wife likes the fish special whatever that is. We will keep going here. It's a great addition to New Albany.,Paul B.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,4,2/17/16,"Beautifully kept restaurant with top quality service. I will admin I'm not a fine dining kind of guy and this place calls for elegant meals paired with a good wine but it doesn't have to be. They also have creative menu options for a nice quiet meal. I had their house made ginger beer, roasted corn and Avocado with a Black Bean burger. The Black Bean burger was made from scratch and was really good and really big. It was kind of messy to eat but was filling and I really enjoyed it.Good experience. Overall I would say this place is more for formal business meals or family gatherings. Not so much for a meal on your own as it is pricey.",Carlos S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,5,3/20/17,"Food and service is always consistent at the New Albany location. Ambiance is a little dark for dinner, but I enjoy this.

Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,4,3/26/17,"This is a nice Cameron Mitchell restaurant. It is on the expensive side. The food was delicious. The breaded chicken sandwich was very good.

Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,5,5/31/15,"My favorite cmr restaurant ever. Have been to the lane ave location a few times and am happy that this location is closerTo my neck of the woods! The scallop dish is so amazing. It is served over greens with golden beets. I also love the King Kong sushi roll and the trio dip. Great to share. Another must try is their carbonated drinks they used to have a bourbon cola (didn't see it on the menu last time I went) but I ordered the grapefruit and margarita drinks last timeAnd they were just as great! Pretty much something for everyone on this menu",Maggie M.,,,,,,

Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,5,2011/3/16,"To begin, I rarely bother writing reviews for places I eat at. Just don't normally ever get around to it. This place however has compelled me to leave one! Is it kinda pricey, yes. Is it worth it, absolutely. Everything we had was fantastic!! From apps, to mains, and lastly dessert, it was all on a higher level than what I had gone in expecting. I cook for a living and take pride in what I do, and this place left me wondering how the hell they created some of the flavors I was enjoying. Our waiter was terrific and attentive as well. I will definitely be returning in the future and recommending friends and family to try them out as well. I went in expecting pretty good gastropub style food based on the menu, but in actuality the food, plus the ambiance, delivered so much more.

Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,2,2010/2/15,"Nice ambiance great bar set up. Meal was a bit expensive with each person getting two glasses of wine...our fault. Most meals were good, scallops and sushi very nice. St Louis BBW ribs were horrible unfortunately I talked my friend also into this selection. Ribs were over cooked  to begin with  and served dry and tasteless.

Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,2,8/31/15,"Had lunch their today.  Ordered the chorizo con queso app and it was decent.  However, the two stars were for a very disappointing cheeseburger and side of colcannon potatoes.   The burger was cooked fine but it was almost inedible due to the sodium dumped on it.  And the potatoes were Sahara dried out.  One bite is all I could do.  Didn't make fuss being in a business meeting but felt I got far less than what I paid for.",Brian S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,3,4/22/16,"As a concept Hudson 29 borrows a lot from Houston's both in menu and in atmosphere. We've been there several times and the best way to describe it is ""predictable"", except for the service.  An occasional nudge to the manager may get someone to your table, but be prepared for the awkward apologies. There's a decent drink menu with cocktails, a nice wine list and a few draft beers that rarely change. Speaking of change, don't expect the menu to do so. If I had to guess, the soup today is carrot ginger. The rest of the menu can be recited from memory after only a few visits. The special features often rotate and re-appear. The menu is eclectic (code word for trying to be everything to everyone). You like sushi? We got sushi! You like Carrot Ginger soup? Yep, we DEFINITELY have that! The problem is if your menu is going to be written in stone tablets you better do each dish really well. That's where Hudson falls down. Their signature burger is greasy, the burger-to-bun ratio is all wrong, and it lacks seasoning. Unfortunately other dishes follow suit. Given the diversity of offerings they should embrace the ability to mix up the menu on a very regular basis. If not they will surely lose customer interest.",Andrew M.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,5,2008/10/16,Second time at this location. Service is great without being over the top. Food is awesome and prices are not out of line with the quality of food versus other restaurants.,Matthew G.,,,,,,

Everything you would expect from Cameron Mitchell.My only request: I would like to see his restaurants include ""organic food selections"". It surprises me that he is slow to join the organic food movement, when it's clearly growing so rapidly.

Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,3,4/25/16,Nice little restaurant in New Albany....a step up from the typical mid-range chains.  I had the black bean burger.

Come out hot, with a chocolate/caramel dipping sauce... Reminded me of a beignet.., please order as a desert or appetizer.. You won't be sorry. I ordered for brunch a Crab Benedict, basically eggs Benedict with a very small portion of crab... Portion size of dish was small, I think it was $15... Not worth it.. Came with a small salad - Tasty but small.. And a really small cup of Fruit... My girlfriend ordered the Short Rib Hash, it was better than my dish, again small portion, served with tortilla chips..

Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,5,2006/2/16,"My husband took me here for my birthday on a recommendation from a friend and co-worker. OMG was this place amazing! It was just a romantic dinner for two. This was no problem with how the restaurant was set up with fluted glass dividers, very manly sheik looking. The atmosphere was beautifully done  Kuddos to the designer! Our server was amazing, she was very friendly and attentive but not overly. She gave great recommendations for drinks, appetizer's and dinner.... We were too stuffed to eat desert. We started with a Fresca which was vodka and grapefruits, OMG was it delicious. Then we had a trio nibbly that included homemade guac, humus and smoked salmon. This was to die for! For our meals we had the Gerber Chicken and the Seared Scallops. It was melt in your mouth good. Even though I was full I did not want to stop eating it was so good. What an amazing birthday! Thanks Hudson 29!Just in closing, my husband is very critical of food locations and his parting words as we left were, ""I really hate dropping a great deal of money on a dinner for two unless it was a great overall experience and this is one of those places that fit the bill all the way around. We will be coming back here!""",Michelle D.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,1,11/14/15,We went for the first time to this restaurant and it was terrible. The table had crusty food on it. The mojito was all ice and the server had to be told to bring me a frosty glass with my beer. The meat was so over cooked it was like eating bark. My husbands sushi was no good either. The server did not know what to do when I answered her question about the quality of the food honestly. I had to ask to see the manager. We will never return.

Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,3,1/17/16,"Another cameron mitchell restaurant.  Nice atmosphere.  My favorite cameron mitchell restaurants are Ocean Club and The Pearl. This one has an eclectic assortment with about ten sushi rolls, five salads, 7 sandwiches and a random assortment of main courses like scallops, ribs and chicken.  I tried the dip trio, shrimp taquitos and mashed potatoes.  My friends tried the french dip and gerber chicken.  The chicken dish looked good and was well received and the sandwiches were huge, no one could finish more than a half.  I think next time i'll try a sushi roll, salad or fried chicken sandwich.  The two appetizers were overpriced and otherwise unremarkable.  Theres ample parking behind the restaurant.  I was here on a Sunday evening and the service was slow, we waited for our waitress to order and to get the check more than would be expected at a cameron mitchell establishment.  I've heard the cocktails are good here so will try another time.  A nice touch was that the cream for coffee was served warm.",Sharmeela S.,,,,,,

The cheeseburger is apparently the chefs special he developed the pickleMayo specifically. Honestly I wasn't that impressed. The Burger was ok- not great and the fries were really greasy. The buttermilk chicken was AMAZING. This should be a meal by itself. But it was placed on a boring bun with the usual toppings and .... Kale. Yes no lettuce here just kale. I'm all for some good kale chips but on my burger and chicken sandwich? I'll stick with some bib lettuce, romaine, ice burg, anything.

I could see coming here more frequently for drinks and appetizers if we lived close by because we enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant, . We tried the Shrimp Taquitos and the Dip Trio. Both appetizers were excellent, the Taquito sauce was delish and the trout dip from the Dip trio was outstanding, we were all raving about it. Mix a little of the guacamole with the trout dip with the tasty lime tortilla chips! We ordered a variety of mixed drinks, I had the Blood Orange Magarita, other ordered the El Presidente and Daisy, some ordered two drinks! They use high quality ingredients they were well worth the $10. I ordered the Prime Rib with the colcannon mashed potatoes. 3 of us ordered the prime rib all at the recommended medium rare which was perfect, mine had little fat and was cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes were full of flavor and left you wanting more! Another had the fish of the day which was Mahi Mahi which was cooked perfectly. Another family member order the hanger steak and enchilada. All meals were bursting with flavor. We decided to have dessert based on the recommendations we had the pineapple upside down donuts and the carrot cake. The donuts were unusual, caution as the pineapple in the middle is hot, still sweet and worth ordering. Though the carrot cake was one of the best we have all had, everyone raved about it and wished we had more. We will be back to Hudson 29!

Appetizers are good, but pricey (3 dip trio for $12 or so)?  I thoroughly enjoy their white wine on tap.  Service is usually attentive.",Lisa B.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,1,12/18/15,"Worst burger I have ever had at a premium price.  The bun was cold as if it had just been taken out of the refrigerator and the meat was two pre-formed thin patties with a little bit of mayonnaise and a few chopped red onions between them.  It did not taste like high quality meat although my dog liked it. There was shredded iceberg lettuce on top and no pickles.

Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,2,2006/5/16,"How's this for fulfilling the Cameron Mitchell reputation for being a chain restaurant? My friend bragged about her ""favorite"" bartender and took me there, reassuring me that I would love the experience, despite the fact that she hasn't eaten well or drank in two years because of a pregnancy. So I asked politely for my drink of choice, knowing that all the listed ""craft cocktails"" would be watered down Cameron Mitchell money-makers, but reassuring her favorite bartender that I will happily pay any extra that he might want to charge, more bitters, more herbs--exactly how I want my cocktail. What I got, expectedly, was a watery cocktail with standard watery ice, nothing like what I ordered. I felt like an alcoholic asking the bartender to add more PREMIUM alcohol and bitters. And reminding him that I didn't mind whatever price he had to charge. He VERY begrudgingly added it. So much for going to a BAR. I would have ordered a French Bordeaux with my medium rare steak, but I'm afraid it would have put him out too much...

I appreciate a kids menu that isn't your typical garbage food. This was quality food and a huge portion for a child. We actually thought the server had accidentally ordered him the adult portion.

I've been to this location multiple times and have had great service and food every time.  Very consistent overall.  The menu has a nice variety and you can always just get a burger, which is actually one of the best burgers I've ever had.  The roasted corn and avocado is a great side too. A++ in my book!",David S.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,3,5/30/15,"The yak yak Sunday gang had,10 in all, dined at this establishment last night. The Mitchell group does a great job of making you feel welcome. Food was good and the wine list was fair but oh the prices were high. Other area restaurants that complete beat them on price. However like I said service service service  that's where Mitchell beats the competition. They had workers running into one another. One note: didn't ask but I don't think they have a children's menu. Not good at those prices. We did see families there. They must rob trains for a living lol.  We'd go back just because of the friendly people",Roger F.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,4,12/22/15,"Good but not great. Chorizo queso was tasty but $11 is pushing it. We had a seared tuna special and prime rib. Both were good but not sure if they lived up to the price. With 1 app, 1 beer and two entrees, a $100 meal is a bit of a stretch. Decor/ambiance is great and service was Cameron Mitchell quality. Worth the visit.",Nancy K.,,,,,,
Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,5,2005/1/15,"Finally, New Albany has a neighborhood fine dining establishment of tremendous quality!! Will be coming back for sure.

Hudson 29 - New Albany,69,4,5,10/13/15,My wife and I have been there 3 times now and we have been very pleased each time. The service is very good and the food was exceptional every time.  The salmon and the blackened grouper are our favorites.,Daniel L.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,2001/2/18,"My friend recommended I take the family here for a nice dinner over Christmas break and I must say, I was very pleasantly surprised. Driving up to the M, we passed through some odd neighborhoods and pulled up to what looked like luxury condo buildings. Seemed the only option for parking was valet, and luckily it was only $7. Entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a nice young hostess who took our coats. Immediately, I felt like I was in a fun restaurant in Vegas. Dark ambiance with classy lighting, soft house music in the background, well dressed young people at the bar having cocktails. We were welcomed by a very nice woman who first took our drink orders. Do yourself a favor and get one of their signature cocktails (Black Orchid tasted like a fruit juice). We started with a couple appetizers; the Hamachi and Fois were both on point. For entrees, we ordered the Salmon & Lobster w/ Risotto (by far my favorite), the Chilean Sea Bass (a bit salty), the Steak in a Bowl (which came highly recommended. I felt the steak was a tad bit overdone but the concept was cool), and the Chicken (a bit dry). For a side, we shared the Lobster Mashed Potatoes which were terrific. Overall, I'd give the food 4 stars, some dishes outshining others. We finished with the Triple Layer Chocolate cake (which was to die for) and the Lemon Creme BrÌÈlÌ©e (also very tasty). The service was a bit slow at times, but the warmth and friendliness from our server was on point. Honestly, probably a top 3 dining experience in Columbus for me, and I'll definitely be coming again next Christmas.Enjoy!",Scott W.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,12/28/17,"I enjoy M once in a while and generally dine at the bar. You can get some good happy hour specials including select food items and drinks, even on Saturday. The bar does fill up quickly. Cris, the bartender, makes a mean cocktail and has good banter with guests. This trip I had the surf and turf sushi which is one of the few sushi's I do eat. Then I had my usual, steak in a bowl. This is a butter poached filet served with some small potatoes and blue cheese sauce, it is always excellent. They allow you to get half orders of sides and I had the truffle Mac and cheese.",Jeffrey S.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,12/23/17,"Great ambiance and uber tall ceilings give it a great feel. Food quality and price matched the feel of the place. My only slight gripe was that the food was a bit lukewarm. Service was excellent and overall a great place for special occasions.",Joshua C.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,10/21/17,"RecommendedThe bartender here is literally one of the best in the country - award winning!!Not a cheap night by any stretch. But if you're going to pay for food, this food is worth it. Amanda was an EXCELLENT server. She was attentive, friendly, adorable, absolutely perfect. The steak was cooked perfectly!! They are SO gluten free friendly - a whole separate menu, fresh baked GF popovers .The only cons - martinis were a little small, I hate when they don't fill the glass...just get a smaller glass and trick me. Ask, the decor was a little dated, but the restaurant is getting a full makeover soon.",Shelly C.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,8/19/17,"We had a reservation August 3, 2017 at the barrel room for 8 people. We asked the manager to ask the chef to pre-fix the menu, we would choose the wine. Chef Jeff Rabold did such an amazing job, I don't even know how to describe how excellent the entire evening went. I wanted to make sure the general manager, Joe Haun and Jeff knew how much we appreciated the food, wine and excellent service we received.The food was prepared to perfection. The service was excellent and the atmosphere amazing.",Tim G.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,2,12/30/17,"Dined tonight. Food was good. Jared our server was great. M would have received a much better rating if they chose a better valet service.Left after our meal to be told ""We can't find your car keys"". First the valet accused my husband of having them, then I got the accusation with the man pointing at me, ""You, Da Wife, you have them.""  (People, remember to give valets an extra key and not the set with house and office keys on them!) Maybe women are spoken to differently in other countries but I am not going to give business to a company that allows me to be spoken to like I am about to be stoned b/c a man working at a valet lost our car keys. After 15 minutes of trying to find the keys with the valet company, I approached the restaurant to explain the situation. Restaurant manager asked, ""Are you really sure they said they lost them"". I responded, no, they have just accused the Da wife of having them multiple times. Finally, the general manager of the restaurant comes out to help and voila, the missing valet and missing keys appear (Just enough time to have copies of the keys made..).Thanks for a wonderful night out and next day having to change our locks. I'll stick to the Refectory.",Mish D.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,2002/5/17,"Great location and an elegant ambiance! Pull up to 2 Miranova Place and await for valet prior to entering into the restaurant. The only parking option unless you are a lucky resident to this beautiful urban living space! $7 valet, which I believe has increased from other late yelp posts. M at Miranova is a fine dining establishment with excellent service and cozy seating arrangements for a couple to a large party. The cocktails are deliciously crafted and carry a premium price but well worth it. I ordered the Marquee and glad I did. Belvedere Citrus Vodka, cointreau, agave, blood orange puree and lemon juice. $12 and 3 down to ensure this review gets the quality words it deserves. It had a clean refreshing taste. They topped it with a beautiful letter ""M"" that tasted like the blood orange puree. Gets an A++ and a must try! A crusty bread and soft butter was delivered to the table prior to dinner.  I love a crusty sour dough bread. Crunchy on the outside and warm and soft in the middle with a slight bite. Slopped that alcohol right up. For the main course I felt adventurous this evening and didnt review the menu and went for the special of the day. I was lucky to find out it was a hanger steak, medium please, with fingerling potatoes, mushrooms and a small garnishment of a mixed green salad. The steak was perfectly cooked with a slight purple to a dark red with a nice sear on the outside. The dish set me back $46. Quality over quantity is the theme here. Good I didnt get overly stuffed since I got to order coffee and donuts off the ""sugar"" menu. I was pleasantly surprised to find out the coffee is not coffee but coffee ice cream. The donuts were benign style that were bannana flavored. Slightly warm, soft with a crunch of the cinnamon sugar coating. Wow! A side of strawberry puree to dip these guys into. A little sweet but gives the donuts a complex taste. The food gets the bulk of this review, however, the staff was amazing! Attentive but not overly annoying. Why not the 5 star you ask, I had a hang over after I saw the bill. Portions could have been heartier and my drink a little stiffer. It would have distracted me from the bottom line and had me skipping out the door with a smile on my face.",Mary B.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,2009/5/17,"One of the best restaurants in Ohio! I love the atmosphere, service and the food is consistently impeccable! I always get the Lobster scones as my appetizer, they serve you three each topped with a small taste of different caviars served in a cone. My favorite dish hands down are the lamb chops!! Theres nothing I would change about this dish, the lobster mash potatoes are rich, buttery and filled with  bites of lobster. Its hard for me to choose any other entree all though I have tried, the lamb is my favorite!",Jihan N.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,7/25/17,"Can't believe I've never reviewed M - it is my favorite restaurant in all of Columbus. Love the ambiance.. very swanky, think South Beach Miami. The black orchid is my favorite cocktail in the city. They have a great wine list too. You really can't go wrong with anything you order from here! The burger sliders or sushi to start are sure to please anyone you're dining with. I typically go for whatever the entree special is because it usually can't be beat. But the pork chop, salmon, and steak are all amazing as well. And don't forget dessert... the coffee and donuts are amazing!",Jennifer O.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,6/21/16,"M is one of the best restaurants in Columbus. Great atmosphere, great food, great drinks, and great service. It's a great dining experience for a special occasion.On the flipside, M is the most expensive restaurant operated by Cameron Mitchell, and therefore, is one of the most expensive restaurants in Columbus. You can easily drop $100/person here if you get drinks, apps, salads, sides, and dessert. I dined here last weekend with my family for father's day. We ordered 1 beer, 1 cocktail, 1 kid's meal, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. After tax and tip, we paid $150-ish... and that was AFTER we used a $50 coupon that we got via email! So yeah, without a coupon, it's $100/person. You could theoretically get away with $50/person, but then you'll leave feeling like you didn't get the full experience. At this point, I'd like to take a detour and make an analogy between Cameron Mitchell restaurants and the Porsche 911 sport car. The base 2017 Porsche 911 has 370 horsepower and costs ~$90k. Even with ""only"" 370hp, it's a sexy car that's likely too fast for your own good. Or you can pay ~$190k to upgrade to a  911 Turbo S with 580 horsepower. So while the 911 Turbo S is clearly more powerful, whether you're willing to pay an extra $100k for an extra 210 horsepower... is another thing entirely. And that brings us back to M. M is clearly the best Cameron Mitchell restaurant in Columbus. But is it worth their cost premium over some of the other nice, but less expensive, Cameron Mitchell restaurants in town? That's a conversation you'll likely want to have with your wallet. Some people want the best, regardless of the cost. Some people would rather have something that's still really nice, but much more affordable. If I was a millionaire, I think I'd be the type who wants the best regardless of the cost. But alas, I'm not a millionaire. So I'll likely have to wait for the next $50 coupon to come along before my wife will let us splurge at M again.",Kaoru M.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,11/19/17,Best food I've ever had at a restaurant! The duck was to die for and steak was cooked perfectly. Wine went down like water and the front of house is amazing too!

M at Miranova,194,4,4,2008/12/17,"I will start by saying we had a lovely time and I would return again but for a different entre. I had the halibut special which was overcooked and under-seasoned. The Caesar salad, however, was wonderful. It is hard to find a Caesar with anchovies (optional of course) Our server, Linda was attentive and personable. Initially I did not get the second cocktail I ordered but it was finally brought to me and also removed from my bill. The decor is a little strange and made getting in and out from the table a challenge and the restroom is very far from the restaurant. It also was louder than I typically enjoy. All in all I would recommend M, it is pricey, but other than me all members of my party found their meal to be wonderful (steak in a bowl and the lamb chops).",Liz S.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,5/23/17,"First of all, I've read a couple of reviews that were complaining about how long the food took to come out.  This ain't that kind of restaurant: do us a favor and go somewhere else, and let people in that appreciate atmosphere and excellent service.This was my second time here.  First was a business dinner that was excellent.  When I was here that time, I spied the outdoor area, kept that in mind as a place to take the wife later.Fast forward to this past weekend, it was our 10th Anniversary, and I have ZERO regrets turning our dinner over to the wonderful staff at M.  If you take your time to dine, and let the staff take care of you, you are in for a treat.  The menu is FULL of surprises and little quirks, including a Root Beer Float (you wouldn't expect at a restaurant like this, but damn.. if it isn't the best on you'll have). I was just enjoying watching other people read the menu and then order it, and watch their delight.  I think that's what CM was shooting for here.Wife had Salmon (superb!), I had the NY Strip.  When my steak came out, it was a slightly overdone for my taste, and the staff immediately took action to correct it, even though I thought I could get by.  They were insistent on it being perfect, and the correction was.I can't wait for my next opportunity to go back.Staff and food was excellent.Thank you Phil and crew for a memorable evening. --D",D D.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,2003/6/16,"This is an upscale restaurant. As you drive to it you go through an impressive gated community type of entrance, and the restaurant sits in the building on top of the long curvy driveway. Valet is probably your best bet at parking here, and like other places in Columbus, valet is cheap ($7). You then enter through what looks like a high-end corporate building (actually, I think its a residential building), and the restaurant is on one end. The ambience is  upscale and swanky. The view of the bridge in the back at night adds to the appeal. We waited for about 15-20 minutes at the bar while our reserved table was being made ready. I didn't mind that too much since there was plenty of seating at the bar. The bar table top had illuminated lights underneath, which gave it a very modern chic look. Once seated, the server was very attentive and helpful. We ordered the foie gras (for some reason they call it only foie) and the spicy tuna rolls as appetizers. The foie gras was delicious, but very tiny, difficult to share among four. There were 8 spicy tuna rolls, good but quite ordinary (nothing that you can't have at an ordinary sushi place). For dinner, my wife ordered the Ahi tuna and I ordered the steak in a bowl Rossini style (which was a 10 oz fillet with foie gras on top). Our friends also ordered the steak in a bowl. I ordered my steak medium rare, and it came out close to medium well, so I sent it back. One of my friends ordered her's medium well, but it came out well done, and she was too hungry to send it back. They re-prepared the steak for me, and this time around it was done perfectly. The fois-gras on top went really well with it. My wife's tuna was tasty but we've had better. When the bill came, they didn't charge me for the steak, which was a very classy move, but one they really didn't need to do. Still it was pricey --- over $200 a couple, but we did have two bottles of wine. So, based on just the food alone, I wouldn't  give it very high marks. However, the ambience, the service, and the overall atmosphere is well worth a visit.",Ness S.,,,,,,

We pulled up to valet, only to be ignored. After a few minutes of waiting, we got out of the bar. The valet apologized, saying ""I'm sorry, I thought you were an Uber."" I am left to believe this is due to the fact that my Jeep Patriot is unlike the sports cars parked out front. We were sat at a table with the previous table's credit card receipts and paper trash. The restaurant didn't seem busy at this time. None of this is a huge deal, except for the pricing of the menu - I expected a little more. We started with the scallop appetizer; I had the Branzino and my boyfriend had the Seabass.

M at Miranova,194,4,4,2/27/17,"I came here during restaurant week about a year ago. We made a reservation, but we weren't seated until 30 minutes after our reservation time. This could've been due to the influx of people  for restaurant week, but I would still expect a place like this to be better about seating people on time. Overall, the experience was good. We ordered the tomato soup with a small grilled goat cheese sandwich on top. This was absolutely delicious--especially the grilled goat cheese sandwich. For the entree, we ordered the salmon and the short rib. Both were delicious. We had the chocolate cake and the lemon creme brulee for dessert. I was a little disappointed the chocolate cake came with a caramel drizzle as opposed to the caramel crisp it was supposed to have on top, but I won't be too big of a diva about that. The chocolate cake itself was moist, rich, and delicious. The lemon creme brulee was to die for. The creamy texture was rich, sweet, and delectable and the tartness of the lemon cut into the richness of the desserts perfectlyOverall, a  great experience despite the slight wait in the beginning.",Sharon L.,,,,,,

When it came time for ordering David made several suggestions and they were home runs. The bread that was brought out was a sourdough with softened whipped butter and smoked red sea salt. First course for me was the tomato soup with a mini goat cheese sammy in the bowl, the soup was very good, it had great tomato depth. My vp ordered the sushi and loved it and her husband ordered the Caesar and proclaimed it was one of the best he has ever had and he wanted to buy some of the dressing. Main course I ordered Salmon which is what David suggested and it was delicious, perfectly cooked with house made gnocchi and more, it was the perfect portion and paired greatly with the wine David suggested. My boss and her hubby ordered the short rib and it was so tender accompained with roasted root veggies and mushrooms. Dessert was divine two of us ordered the Lemon creme brulee and the other ordered the chocolate cake. The lemon creme brulee had a nice size portion was cooked perfectly with a nice burnt sugar crust and accompained with a linzer cookie. I had parked in the garage since no street parking was open, I asked if M validated parked and even though they didn't David found a card to get me out of the garage free. The regular menu reads very well and we all commented M is a gem in Columbus. I highly recommend M to everyone.",Bill E.,,,,,,

So how in the world does it get only 4 stars???  Really? Creative cuisine, superb service and stellar ambiance.  The hallmark of outstanding restaurants is consistency and signature items.  I had not been here in several years and the dining experience is as good as ever.  I had the lamb chops and the poke ... I am already craving them again.  The little touches, like giving you a black napkin or constantly refilling your side of ice without even having to ask, is effortless service that's found in only a few establishments.  Not sure Columbus recognizes the level of cuisine that M consistently hits.  I do and I appreciate it.  A must if you're living in or visiting Columbus!  Definitely 10 stars in my book!",Howard Z.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,3/27/15,"We went here for a celebration dinner. Its a little bit outside of downtown. Just follow your GPS. There isn't much else around it so you aren't likely to get lost. We went in. Its a very pretty place. More typical for a place in a city like New York or LA to me than Columbus. It was almost completely empty on a Thursday night. The bar area was very nice and we want to back to try happy hour.The good: Our table of five was seated in a little area that was surrounded by white curtains so we had some privacy. This was awesome. We also had a view of the river and city. Also awesome. The drinks were very fun. My fiancÌ©s had a flower inside of a giant ice-cube! (Its their signature drink) and everyone at the table tried a different cocktail. All were good and all were fun. We split sushi appetizers. Typical sushi but actually a reasonable price. The entrees were all very pretty (see pictures).The mediocre: My ahi tuna was in cubes. It was over seared on every side so to get to the rare/medium rare tuna in the middle (the good stuff!) I had to get through a lot of wasted over cooked fish :(. Entree was still good though.The bad: When we parked ($7 Valet... I think this was the only option), they said they were so non-busy they would just park in front of the restaurant. He took my car and literally drove it 100 feet to park. Literally. Convenient to get out, but still cost $7. Its an expensive place. Expect to pay. Also, the bathrooms are outside of the restaurant. Not a big deal. Just odd.Great restaurant for a special occasion or if you feel like you want to splurge.

M at Miranova,194,4,2,9/16/17,"Tonight is an example of expecting something great and then being greatly disappointed.  My husband made a reservation for my birthday months in advance as I had always said how much I wanted to try M.  After specifying a special occasion and requesting a private booth, we were put into a table approximately 8 inches away on each side between two other couples.  I felt uncomfortable even discussing menu options with the lack of privacy.  As he could tell how unhappy I was, he requested that we be moved to another small table in a slightly more private area.  Instead, the hostess suggested we could sit outside.  While the weather was quite nice, it wasn't the ambiance I had wanted.  I also noticed that of the four couples on the patio, the manager came up and had long personal conversations with each, we felt ignored.  Our server clearly forgot our salad and to refill water and bread after she asked us and we confirmed that yes we would like her to do so.  The food was good, but the lack of service and feeling like less than valued customers was more disappointing.  I think once was quite enough here- not one of Mitchell's better offerings.

Can order similar many places, should have selected something else from the menu. Roasted tomato soup with goat cheese sandwich. Good, nicely done. Salmon entree with gnocchi and haricot vert. Great flavor and presentation.Beef short rib with red wine reduction. Again, great flavor and presentation. Cameron's always does this dish nicely. Lobster mashed potatoes. Highly recommend sharing this side dish. Lave cake with caramel ice cream. Great. Lemon creme brÌÈlÌ©e. Great presentation and taste. Yum. Service - The host, server at the bar, and our server during dinner were all very professional and get two thumbs up. The wait however for our reservation and somewhat slower service during dinner take this review down a star. Please note that our server during dinner provided impeccable service, very well trained, very cordial, it was none the less slow due to the number of tables he had. This place is a must see for the Columbus foodie. I recommend putting on your bucket list and checking it out at least once.",Larry M.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,5/15/17,Great place to experience fine dining if your looking to splurge a bit. Late posting but I wanted to rave about this place. Favorite appetizer is the Three cones and the king crab is delish!! Wife had the duck which was amazing and I had the Colorado lamb chops which is my fave to get here ... for sides the lobster mash and the asparagus with truffles was cooked to perfection !!!,P S.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,2,2003/11/17,"Yikes. I do not know if I came on an off night or what but my experience here was an absolute joke. I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance and showed up and had to wait a half hour for my party to be seated. Once we were seated, our server tried to connect by thinking she knew someone in my party but she just continued to call him by the wrong name. Our entrees took an hour to come out which made our total time at this restaurant about 4 hours. Not to mention a girl kept coming to our table asking if we had any drugs and our server had to ask her to return to her table. The hosts also asked us to find our own coats in the back despite the fact that we checked them in and had tickets. Unfortunate night.",Kenyah B.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,2008/7/17,They have the best happy hour in town with very good selections.  The bartenders are friendly and know how to make a good drink.  LOVE their concoctions and they know how to make me a dirty martini!,Jay S.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,2007/5/16,Absolutely delicious! Started with the scallop sushi appetizer and we all had fish entrees. The salmon entree was fantastic - presented perfectly and had a very light sauce which I appreciate. Really good special halibut entree as well. We ordered the Mac and cheese side to share and added lobster to it - definitely recommend. Ended dinner with the beignets which were warm and fluffy! Perfect night on the patio with a perfect meal and view of the city!,Amy S.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,2/16/17,"Very nice atmosphere and the menu has a large variety for everyone. We had two waitresses and they were both very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.

But M Restaurant is the one in Columbus.Noticeably, a birthday notice was spread from the host to the server and then to the kitchen as well. AmbianceAs part of our late night privilege and their hospitality, we were seated in a private circle booth with gentle pink lighting and romantic long curtains from the ceiling. We arrived at 10:00pm, and it was expected that the restaurant was quiet and spacious, which provided a better mood to enjoy the night view of Scioto River and Columbus skyline.ServiceOur server Josh was definitely an exceptional guide and help. He offered excellent recommendations and pairing suggestions. An birthday dessert and a personalized birthday message were also delivered to our table by him. Great knowledge and hospitality!FoodIt was obvious that chef made each plate with care, details and creativity. Sea scallops were undoubtedly among the best we've ever had: fresh ingredients, perfectly seasoned and cooked. Veal were also well prepared, cooked, sliced and served. Creme brÌÈlÌ©e with a gift dessert and birthday card was her favorite! Menu was clear and efficiently highlighted.

The lentils were nothing special, but the foie and pork were exquisite.Scallops: 5 Stars-perfectly cooked large diver scallop on a spicy ratatouille and pea purÌ©e.Three Cones: 5 star presentation/3 star taste, like a seafood salad in a sweet wafer.Lobster Mash Potatoes (3 stars): these were buttery and very plain whipped potatoes with a generous helping of lobster on top.

M at Miranova,194,4,5,6/21/14,"This review is long overdue. I actually went here, or should say was happily taken here, for my birthday a couple months ago. It was amazing!! From the moment we walked in, we had a fantastic experience. The maÌ¨tre d' knew it was my birthday and asked me how my day was. He then escorted us to a private booth with a great view of the restaurant. We ordered a medley of dishes and were not disappointed. Each dish was better than the next. My favorites of the night were the black orchid martini (beautiful to look at and wonderfully sweet) and the coffee and donuts dessert (which was complimentary for my bday!). One of the donuts fell during transport and the server brought us two more!! We were beyond stuffed by the end of the meal but in the best way possible. It's a bit pricey but this is one of those places where I can, without reservation, say that you get what you pay for! Some of the dishes are probably more worth it than others (the king crab, for example, was delicious but probably not worth $29 for an appetizer). Overall though, I give this place a solid 5 (+).",Tash L.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,5,2012/5/15,Ok this has been my Cameron Mitchell's go to place for years. I love the ambiance and the whole awesome vibe of this place. I mean I can't say enough about how awesome the bartenders are and they have my favorite martini the Black Orchid. One if the things I love is that their menu is ever changing so I'm never sure what treat I'm in for.  I pretty much get something different every time I go. It's a place where I can have illusions that I'm in the upper two percent of income earners if only for a night. I've never had less than impeccable service and the food is always out of this world. Celebrating my birthday and Veterans Day we outdid ourselves once again.  We started off with the lump crab meat and crostini appetizer and it was off the hook. Omg the crab was so fresh and tasty as was the perfectly toasted crostini. I ordered the sea scallop dinner and my hubby got the salmon dinner. We also got the lobster mashed potatoes. We both enjoyed our entrees but the lobster potatoes were off the hook. I mean the best I've ever tasted in this city and that's saying more than a mouthful.

Even the bartender was creative and made a delicious a virgin drink for me on the fly that tasted just like my favorite pair martini!For an appetizer we had the foie gras which was perfectly cooked and a delectable Fetty pillow of deliciousness. For salads I had a smartly paired goat cheese mousse and red beet salad with pistachios and my husband had a classic Caesar salad that was well done.for dinner my husband had the Seabass that was perfectly salty from the Mirin and was moist and melted in your mouth. My on he tuna was rare in paired with a delicious reduction that was complex and even the mushrooms in carrot ribbons were perfectly cooked had deep levels of flavors. For dessert we had the honey pie which tastes similar to a pecan pie without the nuts but a dominant honey flavor that was complicated by homemade vanilla bean ice cream and apple compote. It was a perfect portion and not too heavy after a lengthy meal.Overall, exceptional, genuine service, upscale atmosphere, thoughtful, well-crafted and skillfully prepared food. Not the absolute best meal of my life but very delicious, and the best I've had in Columbus. We will definitely be back.",Sharon M.,,,,,,

Some of their drinks are actually quite good. I was neither impressed nor disappointed with my snapper or my girlfriends sea bass. My rating reflects price versus quality.

M at Miranova,194,4,4,2004/6/16,"M is one of the few very high end ""luxury"" restaurants in operation in Columbus.  The type of place that exudes exclusivity and opulence.  A dress code enforced type of place where you expect to see a dining room full of business people brokering deals, and old money ""blue hairs"" eating their routine Friday dinner.It's very upscale.  The cocktails are outstanding.  Top notch crafted mixology offerings utilizing creative ingredients.  Yes, the price point is high, but you have to expect that before walking in the door.The food really is great.  A blend of modern American techniques with some classical French.  A food program operating in this format demands excellence, and they deliver on the payoff to the guests.  There is a small room for improvement, but nothing egregious.The service was close to the best I've experienced in Columbus.  Nigel is one of the finest severs I have had the pleasure of dining with.  Extremely knowledgeable on all aspects of the menu.  A very professional and pleasant delivery in communication.  The young man takes his craft seriously, and I appreciate his skill.

When we first got there we were not sure we were in the right place (can one truly trust a GPS in this day and age?) but a valet came out and verified we were and parked our car.  The place is beautiful and they really do a great job of making sure you are taken care of here.  It's nice but just as important it's intimate and not too loud.

M at Miranova,194,4,4,4/26/15,"Celebrated my birthday with dinner at M, and overall it was a good experience.Our reservation was a 8pm. When we arrived at 7:57, I joked with my boyfriend that they wouldn't seat us because we were 3 minutes early. Turns out, they were having a busy night. They asked us to have a seat in the bar, and they would come find us.10 minutes at the bar and we finally got a drink menu. 10 minutes later and the bartender returned to get our order. An additional 10 minutes go by before our cocktails are delivered, with apologies. So...we're 30 minutes behind our reservation time and still not seated. I ordered the Black Orchid, and it was very sweet but perfectly delicious. He ordered a bourbon concoction from the menu which he also enjoyed.40 minutes after our reservation time, we are asked to follow a hostess to our table. Our server was with us promptly, and proceeded to give fantastic service the rest of the night. I ordered scallops, he ordered the ""steak in a bowl"". I also ordered wine, requesting that the staff make a pairing to go along with the scallops - it was spot on.The ""steak in a bowl"" was phenomenal. The scallops were better than OK, but not the best I'd ever had.Desserts were fabulous as well. I had the chocolate lava cake, and my boyfriend ordered the coffee & donuts. Overall, the service was fabulous and the food was very good. Negatives were the 40 minute wait past reservation time, and the super bro-tastic douchenozzle berating his wife all evening at the table next to us. While that's not the restaurant's fault, it certainly didn't help the evening along. The review is short of 5 stars because of the extended wait past the reservation time and the slow bar service to start the evening. A perfect place for celebrations, and we'll likely consider going back in the future.",Marceline D.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,4,3/27/15,I had been waiting to try M for three and half years now so my expectations were high. The dining room is beautiful. Sheer curtains divide the larger room into smaller spaces. Our table of 6 had its own space overlooking the river. Spectacular! Our waitress was very friendly and helped us decide on cocktails. I had to try the Black Orchid. The cocktail was tasty but very sweet so be prepared. I had the salmon feature which was the traditional menu salmon prepared with bamboo rice and frisÌ©e salad. It was full of flavors and textures that lived up to my expectation. The chocolate lava cake with in house caramel ice cream was divine. What a great way to end the meal!

M at Miranova,194,4,4,7/17/14,"A wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion!I ended up in Columbus for my birthday because my fiance was traveling for work and I wanted to celebrate with him. He made the reservation and refused to tell me where we were going. M is an absolutely beautiful restaurant. It has corner booths, large white sheets hanging from the ceiling. It was a beautiful place. We walked in and were created by the hostess who found out it was my birthday. Unlike others here, there was no other mention of it later in the meal, but since we were going to Jeni's afterward, that was alright with us. My fiance and I went with a grazing approach as opposed to appetizer, main, sides, etc. Overall, I would say that the food was hit or miss. First, the complementary sourdough bread was nothing special. I'll admit, I'm a bread snob, and since I eat bread so rarely, I really want it to be good. This was just alright. Next, I ordered the caterpillar roll, which was spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, cream cheese, avocado? onions?- I can't remember the veggies. It was good, especially with the sauces on the side, but we had more coming so I paced myself. Next, we got the wagyu burgers, which were good. The waiter spent a while talking about how special the fries were- they are soaked for a day, etc. Then they turned out to be just ok. Next, we ordered the mac & cheese and the asparagus while my fiance ordered the tuna (which is flown in fresh every day). The mac and cheese was great. The asparagus, not so much. It was overly steamed and mushy and the egg on top was not exactly what I was expecting. The tuna was good, but nothing special, especially after the waiter built it up. All in all, a pleasant dinner at a reasonable price.",Erin F.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,12/16/14,"I've now been to M twice now and both times were absolutely lovely. On my first visit I decided to order the sea scallops which came out at just the right temperature and to my glee with the right texture. The flavor profile for the whole dish was rather fantastic, as the mix of corn spoon bread, grape tomatoes, and haricot verts came together with the sauce. I believe if memory serves the presentation even included some pop corn which was unique. On my second visit I kept with the seafood theme and ordered the Salmon. While this didn't knock off the sea scallops as the reigning champion for me it was still quite impressive in its own right. The salmon has it's own robust set of tastes that interact well including mushroom, tomato fondue, and citrus (in the sauce).As I have written in other reviews I tend to judge restaurants in this particular market segment rather stringently in regard to the quality of their Old Fashioned making skills. In this case M does not get a star knocked off as they did an excellent job with the cocktail. To add to that they seem to have a pretty reasonable scotch selection, so they clearly understand how to win my heart over.",Ryan K.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,3/17/14,"Technically I would give this place 4.5 stars. I have been here on more than one occasion, and while I would still highly recommend this restaurant for anyone wanting a fancier dinner in Columbus, not every single experience would be an uncontested 5-stars. For the most part, however, it would be an easy 5-stars. Now, the drill down...Let's begin with their famous frou-frou martini, the Black Orchid -  A+++++ on both presentation AND taste. Easily hands down one of the best martini EVER and by far my absolute FAVE martini in the C-bus area. The only down side is that at $12 a pop, it is very easy to start racking up your alcohol tab unknowingly... My girl friends and I were all feeling pretty good sipping away on our 3rd round before our entrees every showed up. Needless to say, the bill was kind of a shocker!Desserts - Very, very  good, but not extraordinarily memorable like a lot of restaurants in this price range. I have tried most of the dessert items on their menu, and while I always enjoy every single bite during the dessert round, I don't salivate thinking bout any of the items in particular (unlike Smith & Wollensky's coconut cake, which I dream about sometimes).Food - one word: YYYUUUMMMMMM!!!!! I have successfully eaten my way through half of the appetizer, sushi, and entree items and I must say, can't really go wrong with anything. I would caution against trying the lobster mac 'n cheese though - it is pretty good, but for the price, you are better off with paying the high price for the S&W's version (yes, it is just WAY better). This is not an inexpensive place by any means, and although they will not kick you out for wearing jeans and a t-shirt, you will probably feel out of place, so use this as an opportunity to glam up a little! Bon appetite! :)",Andrea S.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,2,12/31/15,"Only a good restaurant and it only deserves a total of two stars due to the waiter and staff. If I give you my drink ordered in a certain way, why would your bartender serve ""her"" own recipe? Only after serving four drinks the waiter says they were out of two ingredients which leaves only two ingredients to make my drink. I understand there are various ways to make an Espresso Martini. But do not charge someone for partial drink and call it complete. This is why I have my own card with the printed recipe. Now that I have that off my chest, the food was delicious but lukewarm. It was as if the food was done and then was put into a warmer until the whole table was ready to be served. Overall, slow service all the way around. Menus were not seen for twenty minutes and I had to clear my excess used glasses from our table. Our celebration for my son's birthday was a dud.

The employees are great, they know their products really well and love to talk to you about whatever you're curious about on the menu. Even the manager comes around just to make sure everything is going well. As for the food, best salmon I've ever had! The salmon is seasoned and cooked to your order. We also ordered the chicken. The sauce the chicken was covered in was excellent. The proportions were reasonable so you won't leave hungry. We still ordered dessert even though we were pretty stuff.

M at Miranova,194,4,2,3/27/16,"This place has been on the list for long time since we love Ocean Club, their sister restaurant.  (We think Ocean Club is the best restaurant in Columbus).  My wife kept telling me ""M is supposed to higher end than Ocean Club"" so our expectation was high (or as high as Ocean Club"")20 min after we were seated, nobody came to take our drink orders so I was about to complain to management then a server who was serving near by tables noticed and followed up with us to see if we have been helped.  After I mentioned no, he said ""let me help you out then"".  According to him, there was no clear table assignment so he wasn't sure who was serving our table so he just stepped in for us. Throughout the night, he did a good job but food deliveries were so slow to the points where my wife and I were looking at each other and saying ""wow... It is so slow here...""   Yes, desert delivery was slow as well which was confusing because we thought they were pre-made. Quality of the food was good but not as good as I remember at Ocean Club.  I knew it was going to be expensive (when four of us went to Ocean Club, it was a little over $300 including tip).  At M, it turned out to be closer to $200 with tip for two of us.

I also had a few dirty martinis (with blue cheese stuffed olives) that were very well made and consistent. As a table we ordered the truffle mac & cheese, asparagus, and lobster mashed potatoes as sides - the mac & cheese was by far the best of the three. I also ordered the ravioli with duck confit as an appetizer - yummy!! The bread and butter they bring to the table is also very good, if I had any room left I would have eaten more of it.

M at Miranova,194,4,4,2002/2/15,"Ok. My wife and I came back here to give it another shot and we left with very mixed feelings. First, the bad:We had to wait over 30 minutes AGAIN for our reserved table. WTF. Again, if you're a flagship and you're expecting top dollar, I am NOT going to wait 30+ mins for a table that YOU promised would be ready earlier. I had a chat with the manager who apologized profusely and things went very well from there. However, why waste resources on redeeming an experience when you could have just had a great one to begin with?  OK, now the good:We were seated within 5 mins of me talking to the manager. We were placed in a giant booth facing the restaurant, which was also nice, and we had probably one of the BEST servers (Tiffany) one could ask for. She was upbeat, personable, and did a great job turning the night around with her impeccable and timely service, smile and attitude. We had the King Crab appetizer again because it was so good the last time we had it. Anything drowned in butter is awesome in my book and this did not disappoint.  Bread service was also fantastic, warm sourdough with soft butter and sea salt (flavored?).Wife had the bronzino, which I thought had a great balance of flavor profiles and textures. It was a delight and cooked perfectly.I had the chilean sea bass, which was also very good. The broth reminded me of wonton soup (even though it says thai broth) and the shrimp dumplings, while small and scarce (2) were also prepared very well.  The sea bass was meaty and buttery. Full of flavor and had a wonderful melt in your mouth experience.We also had Tiffany choose our dessert for us, and she brought out 6 mini cookies with the coffee and donuts. Word to the wise, the thing that looks like an espresso, is not liquid, you have to use a spoon. I just saved you from looking like a total noob (unlike me). The beignets were really good, but had a bit too much cinnamon/sugar coating, it was a little overwhelming.  The sauces were on point. Chocolate Chip cookies, well, what can you say? Perfection with the whipped cream.Finally, we were comped our appetizer due to the wait (a given) but we had mentioned our frustration to the bar while we waited for a table and one of the bartenders brought over a drink my wife and I were considering but decided not to order. She found us at our table and gave it to us on the house as well. I didn't catch her name, but I was grateful and impressed with her attention to our situation and trying to help rectify a situation even though it wasn't the bar's fault. Kudos to her and Tiffany for turning around what started out as a poor night out!",Moses S.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,3,1/20/15,"Very disappointed in our dinner during restaurant week.  Our reservation was for 7:30, we didn't sit down until 8:15.  I know that it's very busy during RW, but don't overbook then.  Service was great, no issue there.  Food was very average.  The tomato soup was just ok, a bit salty, and not as good as last few times we have been.  I ordered the Beef Short Rib, gf the salmon.  Time in between soup and meal was about 30 minutes.  When they finally arrived, they brought two salmon dishes, of course I said something, they immediately brought out the short rib and it was lukewarm. I almost sent it back, but figured it would take much longer so still ate it.  The meat was tender, but was warm/cold.  The mashed potatoes were warm/cold.  My gf's salmon was delicious.  They forgot my ice cream with the lava cake.  It was tasty, along with the Creme Brulee.  Her wine was great, but 3.50 for Pepsi??  We didn't end up getting our car until a bit after 10.  It was my worst experience here the few times I have been-Better step your game up M or I will have to spend my $ elsewhere during Restaurant Week.",Todd G.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,7/26/14,"I came here a couple weeks back for dins with the bf. I have a more detailed review of the dishes with pics on my blog (http://www.melonchef.com/2014/07/m-at-miranova.html) but here's a rundown.Ambiance: intimidating. It feels like a swanky club in Vegas perhaps, but everything seems a little too...perfectly planned if that makes any sense. I did feel especially fancy.Service: good. Pace was great, they checked in with us often but just enough, and overall there weren't any faults.Food: good, not amazing perhaps but very solid1) Black orchid drink - my favorite item of the night. It tasted like lychee (even though it has no lychee in it o.O). Ice sphere dude in the middle looks cool, and it melted very slowly so the ice didn't significantly dilute it by the time I drained my drink.2) Bread - tasted okay, looks awesome3) Three cones with salmon gravlax- basically seafood salad in waffle cones. Cool but a tad pricy for what it is. Caviar was nice I guess. Sweet waffle cones were strange. Salmon gravlax was strange.4) Veal mignon - boy's dish, really great. I liked the veal cheeks especially.5) Sea scallops - good. Popcorn was strange in concept but didn't taste strange with the dish, surprisingly.6) Mac and cheese - good. I probably could've ordered this alone and been completely satisfied (cept that it's all carbs and fat I guess, so my scallops were healthier).7) Coffee and donuts - unnecessary to order, I don't think M shines in their dessert menu. I would've preferred a stop at Jeni's instead.Overall, a solid meal. The mains were great and everything else was okay with no duds. I do like this place, although I think I prefer The Refectory more for a special occasion.",Helen S.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,12/22/14,"I admit, 60% of this 5 star review is based on the fact that they serve molten chocolate cake, and it was perfect. There is not many restaurants in Columbus that serve this fav dessert of mine (most like cap city, cameron american bistro serve a warm chocolate cake but NOT a molten choc cake). So, there you go, the five star. But also, the place was nice and beautiful, without the snobbish atmosphere. Server was attentive and friendly. I ordered the foie gras for appetizer, and steak for entree. M is not a steakhouse, but I can tell you, this steak was far much delicious that a steak at some of the steakhouses in town.",Gerry J.,,,,,,

I loved the crab in butter and the lamb was amazing.Only draw back was the coat check girl did not take my coat even after I asked her twice. It was as if she just kept forgetting.

I'm going to cut to the chase and mention that this was the best sushi I've ever had! We tried the dragon roll with barbecued eel and it was yummy!  Also, Kyle our server was fantastic! He asked if we were dining for any special occasion and I mentioned that it was our 1-year anniversary. At the end of the meal, he let us choose a dessert that was on him!

M at Miranova,194,4,3,9/14/10,"Be sure to come a little after dark so that you may greater experience the lighting and ambiance of the restaurant. M Restaurant and Bar is one of Cameron Mitchell's restaurants located in downtown Columbus. The decor is chic enough for a young couple to gawk at yet they balance it off tastefully for diners of all ages.We shared the following dishes between two people:Steak Burger with truffle fries: I asked for a medium cooked burger with the onions grilled and it came out perfectly. It was a good burger with the usual pickles, lettuce, cheddar, and onions. And although it was good - I can't say it was the best burger i've ever had. I personally wouldn't have minded a special sauce to make it a little more memorable. Can't go wrong with truffle fries though and thinly cut fries are my favorite. Paired off with a red wine and it made a pleasant entree.Chilean Sea Bass: This type of fish is so naturally buttery that it comes out delicious anyway you cook it. The M did an especially great job with their Asian inspired twist, adding a couple of delicate shrimp dumplings, and laying it over a light broth.Side of truffle mac n cheese: Loved the crispier, parmesan crusted top layer of the truffle mac n cheese. Enough to share between 2-3 people as a side, it was very cheesy at the bottom. Coffee and donuts: Donut hole sized apple fritters with two dipping sauces - caramel and raspberry.  A bit messy but only if you insist on the addicting caramel sauce. The coffee semifreddo was strong and a great contrast to the hot apple fritters.Who says you need to order filet mignon and freshly sauteed vegetables to dine at a white table tablecloth restaurant? I had a great meal with my donuts donuts, mac n cheese, and burger :)Being from out of a town, I was able to ask the hostess to call a cab for us and it came no later than 5 minutes after.",Samantha L.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,2006/11/12,"M is one of those dining experiences that is so complex, it is difficult to give a singular rating. Overall, this was a four-star dining experience, and M is still one of the best restaurants in Columbus.This was my first time dining at M in over 10 years. I remember thinking, back then, that it was one of the best meals I'd ever had. Obviously, my tastes have become more refined over the years, but the tastes still stood up to what I remembered. We started with the surf n' turf roll, just barely missing the Friday happy hour pricing. I felt strange asking the server what parts were cooked (I don't mind raw food, but Dad does). The beef on the roll is served VERY rare, fyi. I liked it, though the roll overall was not as flavorful as it could have been.I ordered the veal mignon and truly did not want that dish to end. One of the veal portions was served on an asiago crepe filled with shiitake mushrooms. I die. I savored each bite as it melted on my tongue. The sauce was a little on the too-salty side, but overall the rest of the dish was so spectacular, I didn't mind one bit. (I suspect I'm overly sensitive to saltiness.)I don't remember the menu having so many asian influences when I came before (my selection wasn't asian-fusion, but a lot of the seafood dishes were). I also was a little disappointed that there didn't seem to be a more seasonal effort. Of the dishes that weren't asian-inspired, many seemed like autumnal dishes (including my veal). I don't go often enough to know how often the menu rotates, but I didn't get the feeling the menu changes much from season-to-season. For the level of culinary artistry M seems to aspire to, making seasonal changes would be the next step towards greatness.Service was a little shaky this time around. I had to call and push back my original reservation time, and the woman on the phone sounded pretty unsophisticated and gruff. I would have expected a cool, elegant ""we look forward to seeing you at 7, Miss J.""  Instead, it felt more like I was ordering a pizza. ""Time? Name? Ok."" *Click*The hostess, when she seats you, might trade your white napkin in for a dark one, if you're wearing dark colors. For dinner service, our server seemed... new. She gave a little spiel about a champagne when we sat down-- overused ""fantastic"" a lot and seemed nervous. When Dad asked her to tell him ""more about the champagne"" later, she just repeated the same rehearsed speech. He asked how much, and it was $25 per glass. I hate to be crass about asking for prices at restaurants, but this was good to know... it was enough that we decided not to get two glasses of it. We did order a nice bottle of wine, though. Her pour was shaky, dribbled wine on the tablecloth. But, despite these small faults she was sweet, and we felt very well attended. Dessert was good. We ordered the peach pie (of course not in a traditional sense) and a chocolate cake. She put them both on the same platter so the three of us could share them more easily, which was nice, but two plates would have been fine. The peach pie with the bourbon ice cream was a delight, but the crust was a little stale and not very tender. Decor is gorgeous. There's a small side patio lounge that looks fantastic for drinks and an app. I think I'll earmark another Friday just for drinks out there sometime this summer. With a few updated tweaks, M could easily renew its status as the best restaurant in Columbus, without having to rest so much on its laurels.",Catherine J.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,4/24/13,"Solid happy hour menu (5-7pm).

Many of the tables offer a good amount of privacy. Would be a nice spot to celebrate something intimate, like an anniversary. Compared to the pretty penny you'd normally have to spend to eat here, the happy hour is a steal!tip: park your car on the main street and walk up (weather permitting) - otherwise it's a mandatory $5 valet once you enter Miranova circle",Adrienne C.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,2,11/15/12,"Unfortunately, I was not impressed with M. I went here on my Birthday.. The atmosphere was great, felt a little stuffy, but was enjoyable. I think restaurants can be higher end and not feel like you have to talk quietly, watch everything you say and not laugh without feeling like you are interrupting people's evening. The staff was great and very very helpful, especially our waiter (Can't remember name, sorry). The food was alright, I did cringe at the thought of my Mother paying the bill as a Birthday gift, because it by no means, was worth the price. I think I could have went to many other places in Columbus and enjoyed it much more for a lower price.I really did expect to enjoy this place and food due to going to other Cameron Mitchell Restaurants.

M at Miranova,194,4,3,2006/1/15,"My husband and I dined at M this past weekend with some family. We went in with high expectations, all of which were met but one. I had the Caesar salad,  8oz Filet, and ordered the lava cake. Best steak I've ever had. The service was great and very entertaining, I might add. The 1 shortcoming was the restrooms. What good is a delicious and beautifully prepared meal if you come back to the table with no appetite?I've seen nicer, well kept restrooms in highway rest areas.In order to get the soap, I had to literally slide my hand between the despensers and sink, touching both, which is unsanitary.  In this case there was NO SOAP. Florescent lighting, and only 1 of the chipped metal 'stalls' was usable and it was dirty. I understand that M doesn't have a restroom of their own and you are sent to the hallway of the Miranova to use theirs, but this type of restaurant should not just be a meal, but an experience. As delicious as the food was, I'd hesitate to return due to that experience.",Megan B.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,2,1/22/16,"I have been going here for years, and there's a reason for that. Top notch food, great service, and cool atmosphere. The latest visit was a major disappointment. Full disclosure - it is restaurant week, the week where restaurants overbook themselves and under-deliver. Reservation was for 8pm, was seated around 8:45pm. No comp for the drinks, no big deal. Our waiter was clearly more interested in other tables. This was an agonizingly slow experience from start to finish. I have to say, the food was not quite on point with what I am used to. It was certainly good, but just felt a bit generic (restaurant week, I guess). Just because you pay slightly less for a special week should not indicate less effort, quality, or service. As a process engineer, how can one of the best restaurants in Columbus be using their wait staff to bus tables concurrently during the busiest week of the year? The last thing I want to see is my waiter bussing endless empty plates off a table while my empty plate sits in front of me. And then, closing and paying the bill. I didn't think it was going to end. Not once did anyone ask how my meal was, etc. until we got our coats. The guy asked us how things were, I told him it was terribly slow, and he didn't even react. The whole experience made me think that they despise restaurant week and couldn't wait for the night to end.",Chris M.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,5,12/23/13,"There are places that you hear about that are really good, but don't live up to the hype. There are places you leave pissed off because you spent too much money on something that wasn't really worth it. There are places you never want to come back to. M is not any of those places. Instead, it's one of the best dinner's you probably will ever have and it is worth every penny. This is probably hands down the fanciest place I've ever been. If you read my reviews, you can see I stick to the hidden gems; the cheap street eats. My boyfriend and I go out to fancier places about 4 times a year(our birthdays, Valentine's, and Christmas). We have wanted to try M for a long time and it did not disappoint at all. You know this place is fancy because there is no parking lot. It's pretty much all valet. However, if you don't mind walking, there are parking meters less than a block away and they are really close to Bicentennial Park and the Scioto Mile, which you might want to walk around anyway. Anyway, the prices are steep. You are going to spend about $50-$80 per person if you get a drink, an appetizer, and an entree. Which I did. Everything I got tasted delicious, and I tried all my boyfriend's selections and they too were excellent. Cocktails- We are cocktail people. Sure, wine is nice. But I can open up a bottle of wine and pour it into a glass at home. I don't however have all the fancy makings of a good cocktail. My boyfriend had the Perfect Storm, which was Ohio Apple Cider, ginger beer, rum, and velvet falernum. It was a good fall drink, hints of vanilla, cinnamon, and other fall spices. I went with the Black Orchid, which was the coolest drink I've ever had. It had an orb of ice in the glass with a MOTHERFING ORCHID FLOWER frozen into the ice. And it tasted delicious. It was very fresh and fruity and even if it wasn't a fall drink, I enjoyed it so much. Appetizers-For this, we both went with the soup. It was a roasted tomato soup. How they serve it is the coolest part. When it's delivered to the table, there is a little goat cheese sandwich at the bottom of the bowl and no soup. Then, the waiter pours the hot soup over the sandwich from a copper pot tableside. It was very impressive. The soup was amazing. The tomato soup had so much flavor and was so creamy and the goat cheese worked so well with the tomato flavor. Entrees-Boyfriend had the Ahi Tuna with foie gras, vegetables, and a black truffle reduction. It was amazing. We had never had foie gras before and after tasting it, we wish we would have got that appetizer instead of our soups. So good. For my entree, I got the sea scallops with mushroom risotto, lobster-butter sauce, and fennel salad. The scallops were perfect. 3 huge scallops cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth like butter. I rarely get scallops in Ohio, but these were to die for. I woke up the next morning and said to my boyfriend, ""I want more of those scallops for breakfast."" This was one of my favorite meals in Columbus. I would recommend it to anyone on a special date or just anyone who doesn't mind paying a little extra for a perfect meal. You will not be disappointed. I wish I could afford to come back here more often, for sure.",Emily L.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,4,3/14/16,"From the moment you walk in til your check the service here is on top of it. Coat check, the quick refills of water, the very very attentive waitstaff. I can tell that the waitstaff is trained very well to look for your eating cues. For food I had the tomato bisque with goat chese crostini, the 3 cones, the ahi tuna seared with foie gras and truffle reduction, and lastly the lemon creme brulee. As I am writing this I slippin into a food comatose already. All of the food was very well balanced in taste. The soup was poured table side. It had some sort of green flavored oil and a crostini in it and very hot soup poured live. My only tiny little gripe was that I was I had maybe just goat cheese mousse quenelles itself off the crostini. The 3 cones are were had lobster topped with 3 different kinds of caviar (wasabi tobiko, ikura, and classic caviar) and on the side was chopped hardboiled egg with house cured salmon. The taste was on point with this dish. It was a little difficult to eat because as I ate the cone, it broke into several pieces. For my entree the ahi tuna was seared to my liking, came with a truffle reduction, and the acompaniements of vegetables and foie gras were a nice addition. It was nice to have a mild truffle flavor. There are many a times where too much truffle is added where it overwhelms the rest of the ingredients. Again, well balanced. For dessert I could not pass up the lemon creme brulee. It came with blueberry compote and some small dessert bar that I forgot. Having the blueberry compote gave it a nice tartness so that you weren't overloaded with sweetness. It tricks your tastebuds into thinking you can eat it all. Then when you eat it all you regret how much darn food you ate.",Kathy B.,,,,,,

As weird as it sounds, but I'm a huge person on the quality of water and may I tell you, M's water is THE BEST water I have ever tasted. On to the more important things. THE FOOD - We started off with the Caterpillar roll, best sushi I've had in a while. The ginger that came along with it complimented the sushi perfectly.

M at Miranova,194,4,4,8/28/13,"We came here for my wife's birthday, and the service was top notch from start to finish. They even bought her a desert. The decor is modern, hip, and inviting. It's upscale but not stuffy.They start you off with some of the best salty sourdough I've ever had. We ordered a couple of black orchids; one of the best cocktails I've ever had. We got king crab as an appetizer. Little toasts served with a small jar of king crab pieces drowning in butter. Pretty amazing, but the portion size was pretty small for the $29 price. My wife got the scallop entree. A hefty portion of 8 or so scallops with rice and pork. The scallops were perfectly prepared but the rice and pork were overly salty. So much so that she couldn't finish the dish. I got the surf and turf: a sushi roll made with shrimp tempura and filet mignon. It was one of the best things I've ever eaten, and at $16, it was very reasonably priced.We ordered a side of the lobster mashed potatoes. Creamy potatoes with a ton of delicious lobster meat on top. It was floating in butter, and you couldn't even mix it all in. It would have been better with less butter.We finished our meal off with coffee and donuts, and cherry pie.

M at Miranova,194,4,3,2008/3/11,"I will say that this place is lovely.  Beautiful architecture inside and out.  It exudes a chic and swanky ambiance.  It is the place to see and be seen - people watching can get quite entertaining as in guessing the age gap between the couples who came in (if you catch my drift).  And I will give them very high marks for a fantastic blueberry mojito!  After that - our experience began to sag.Saturday night, we had reservations, got there on time but had to wait for close to half an hour - at the bar - before our table was ready.  That did not sit well with me, but the aforementioned mojito's soothed that wrinkle out. The decor is very nice although a bit over the top; pillows, sheer curtains, mood lighting....let me back up about that mood lighting.  Mood lighting is fine with me and can even enhance things if it is one consistent light, but we happened to be seated directly under one of the lights which changed from blue to red to something in between.  That was a bit disorienting to me; didn't like it.  We saw some interesting appetizers go past and decided to try one just for the hell of it.  Three cones is basically three very small ice cream like cones with a dollop of different seafood salads in them.  Nice presentation, interesting tastes - but no wow factor - and $17.  The appetizer cost nearly as much as hubs short rib entree.  The short ribs were very good; tender succulent but a bit swimming in sauce.  I should have ordered some veggies instead of my $9 wedge salad.  Talk about a mark up!The bread they brought to the table was fresh out of the oven and a delight to this carb addict.  I had the ahi tuna which was just ok to me.  Nothing to stop the presses about.  Now the lobster mashed potatoes to share ($14) was excellent.  A lot of places who do this dish have small to tiny bits of lobster in the mash,  M had chunks in and on.  Tasty!Desert was a lemon brulee.  Very nice lemon flavor with lemon zest on top of the brulee.  The menu stated it came with lemon and goat cheese cookies.  I was looking forward to this until the desert arrived.The cookies (3) were about the size of a quarter.  Not much to really get the full taste of the thing.Our server was very nice but a bit slow.  Perhaps it was due to the crowd that evening - I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt.  I am not marking them low for the price...we knew that going in and that is not an issue.  I was just hoping for the dining experience to match the ambiance.",Teri D.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,5/26/11,"This is my second time in M. I believe I ate at M last winter. Since this is already spring, i would expect them to have changed the menu. But they didn't. But the food is was really good. Especially for Columbus's standard, it was spectacular.We are celebrating my friend's graduation/job offer/move to sf. We ordered the Moet and Chandon Imperial to start our meal. I love that champagne.We shared 3 appetizers for a party of 6. The butter poached alaskan king crab was spectacular. I didn't expect the dish to be that good. The butter was so good. And than we had the trio of cones. This was also delicious. My favorite was the tuna. And of course, we had the foie gras. And as i said before, foie gras are foie gras. They are always fattlicious.I had the prime steak. It was slightly overcooked. But nonetheless, it was still really delicious. The creamed leeks was a very great addition to the dish, along with the roasted vegetables. Another highlight of the night was the tuna. The tuna was very elegantly prepared. The tuna was barely touched, it was still very rare. The tuna was very juicy and delicious. I had always enjoyed the short ribs at M, and tonight it didn't disappoint. The scallop was also perfectly cooked and served on top of risotto. I'm not a big fan of the veal mignon. I really don't get the concept of the dish and it lacked the wow factor of the other dishes.As this is a celebration, i wish the waiter had given us a complimentary. Perhaps a mac and cheese or something?The desserts was also disappointing. Both the creme brulee and chocolate cake was a major disappointment. The supposably melted chocolate didn't melt at all. It was stiff. If they put uganda vanilla beans, i think the creme brulee would have been a lot better. But desserts was saved by the bread pudding.In the end, i enjoyed eating at M. a lot. I believe this might be the best fine dining in Columbus. I do have one suggestion. I hate the lighting. the light keep on changing colors. It's hard to see the food!

M at Miranova,194,4,2,2009/7/14,"My friend and I went there for dinner on Friday. The restaurant is in a great location. The service wasn't nearly what it should have been for a restaurant of this caliber though. The server brought bread out after we had already received and almost finished our appetizer. You would think bread should be one of the first things brought to the table. The meal was fine. Trying to get the check however, proved very difficult. Our server was chatting for at least ten minutes with another table near us so we weren't able to get his attention. We asked a different server who walked by for our check, but still waited. Finally my friend had to walk up to our waiter during his still lengthy chat with the other table and asked him for our check. So after over 20 minutes if waiting, we finally got our check. In addition, the comment card that was included with the check was already filled out with excellent ratings! Needless to say, it is insulting to have a comment card already filled out , presumably by our server (Trevor). Why even bother with comment card if customers can't fill it out themselves?!",Chad R.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,2,2/17/13,"My boyfriend made us a reservation for Valentines Day. Obviously, every nice restaurant is going to be busy but we had to sit at the bar and wait 30 extra minutes before a table was ready. Our waitress was terrible. It was like she constantly forgetting about us. Took forever to get the food... Then we're done with our food and it takes her 20 more minutes to get back to us to offer desert, but we pass. She brings the bill she added on 2 drinks that we ordered and already paid for at the bar. Then she 'fixes it'. We check the account and she charged us 3 times! $114, $114, and $87. It's a pretty restaurant, I hope that they aren't always this terrible but with that being my first experience I will not go back. Not happy about the service.",Meliss P.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,3,2008/4/13,"I came here with a group of my girlfriends for Restaurant Week, a bit of a weekday indulgence.  It's an interesting place with decor that echos the menu with its mixture of influences...  Mostly ""contemporary American"" with an Asian twist, very showy and hip...and expensive.  However, with Restaurant Week, guests make a selection of appetizer, meal, and dessert from a fixed menu for a more affordable $35 (not including tip, tax), the price of just the meal, normally.  For my meal, I started off with the ""roasted tomato soup, goat cheese sandwich"" which sounds like a whole meal, but sandwich here means a few small pieces of crostini-like toasted bread with a smear of goat cheese.  The soup is very good, though.  Rich and creamy, it is very good tomato soup.  There's not really enough goat cheese to affect it one way or another, though.The main course was ""veal mignon"" which is actually an assortment of items. The title meat shows up in the form of a few small but tender pieces of veal tenderloin and a scoop of braised veal cheek (reminiscent of a very heavily marbled piece of slow roast beef).  This is served atop a handful of roasted root vegetables and carrots and an asiago cheese crepe with shitake mushrooms.  Of this, the veal tenderloin was the best aspect, with a nice texture and delicate flavor that seemed somewhat out of place with all of the heaviness of the cheek and crepe.  Honestly, the flavor of these items became monotonous very quickly for me, though the pickled red cabbage and the pungent root vegetables did help a bit in breaking this up.  If you eat everything all at once, it makes a nice mix, but the items themselves or even eaten in a sequence don't really stand alone for more than a bite or two.Finally, dessert.  At the waiter's recommendation, I went with the ""Cake and Ice Cream"" which consists of a dense chocolate lava cake, a scoop of caramel ice cream, and a turtle (cashews with caramel, chocolate).  It is good, but I would say if you are not a fan of dark chocolate, perhaps try something else.  I do like dark chocolate and flourless chocolate cake in general and this was almost too dark.  The flavor was quite bitter, rather like a bar of 75%+ dark chocolate.  It goes better with the ice cream, but if you don't like mixing textures, I'd say try the lemon chiffon cake or something else.  As to other aspects, the complementary bread is nice with a soft inside, crisp crust, and unusual smokey flavor.   Service for our visit was also very good. We had a great waiter who was attentive and helpful.  However, if you have a party member who is lagging behind, don't order until s/he arrives. If my experience is anything to go by, his/her meal will lag behind the rest of the evening, even if it is only a few minutes that s/he is late, and even if the place isn't that busy.  The worst was the main course which came out only when my companions were finishing their meals.  I can only assume that the veal takes a very long time to prepare... that or their kitchen has a very rigid system.One other note - parking isn't necessarily free.  There is a very convenient garage (do not pull into the cobble stone drive like the GPS says unless you want valet parking: the entrance to the garage is at street level) but M does not officially give out vouchers.  It might not hurt to ask your server if you can get validation, though.  Overall... I can't honestly say ""I'm a fan,"" but I would say that M is ""A-OK.""  Even if the prices were more budget-friendly, I don't know that it is a place I'd be running back to any time soon.  However, for a special night out or just a fun indulgence, it might be worth a try.  I understand that they are friendly to newlyweds and probably to other events, so it might be a place to try for that.",Carolyn E.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,4,1/23/14,"Came here after a thorough search of the options for restaurant week and was very pleased with their menu. It was a beautiful atmosphere and our waiter was great. The food was wonderful, pricy, but that is expected if you're going here. I had a good meal here, it is somewhere I will definitely return to for happy hour.  The sushi and chop salad I had was delicious. My salmon was cooked very well, although my friend said hers was a little over cooked for her preference. The homemade gnocchi was delicious and the lobster pieces were a perfect touch. The dessert really topped the meal off though. The lemon chiffon cake was out of this world. The chocolate lava cake was pretty standard but delicious none the less. Overall great meal and big portions.",Ali W.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,2/17/13,"Like the rest of Columbus, my wife and I came here for Valentine's Day.  Making a reservation was the extent of my V-Day plans, so I really needed M to come through for me.  She wasn't disappointed and had a great time (that was made even better by an entertainingly ridiculous and loud argument a nearby couple was having).  Sure, we had to wait a little for our table despite our reservation, but having a perfect old fashioned at the bar wasn't too painful.  The Black Orchid my wife ordered wasn't bad, tasted kind of like lychee juice.  Started with king crab stuffed in a mason jar of melted butter, which was amazing.  Crack cocaine.  The lamb was well-cooked, really solid.  Mac and cheese with truffles was also delicious and a relative value at $15 (sarcastic).  Sea bass was decent.  We had a great waiter who was attentive but not awkwardly hovering.That being said, I was glad I was a few drinks in by the time I got the check, but I guess I expected that.  The decor is cool, but almost in a trying-too-hard kind of way.  Heavy on the darkness with purple lights thing.  Anyway, in summary, it's a decent place for a romantic dinner on a special occasion.",Peter L.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,2002/2/16,"Yum!  My husband and I went for our anniversary and had a great time.  The valet was quick and attentive, ladies at reception greeted us warmly and wished us a happy anniversary.  We were a little early so we went to the bar.  The drinks were delicious and served quickly and the bartender was friendly and talked about local breweries with my husband.  We were seated by the window with a city view.  It was nice and dark and romantic!  We got the cones for a starter and they were amazing.  I got the scallops, which were cooked to perfection, and my husband got sushi.  He said the surf and turf roll was the best he's ever had.  The lobster mashed potatoes were to die for, with huge chunks of lobster in them.  We split the coffee and donuts for dessert and they comped them for our special occasion.  The waiter also gave my husband a free stout for dessert since he's a craft beer enthusiast.  We didn't really look at prices when ordering and were expecting the bill to be around $250 but were pleasantly surprised that it was only $125 (my husband had several fancy pants beers included in this total).  I'd definitely recommend for a date night and we will go again.",Kelly M.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,9/24/10,"Ah, the challenge of Yelp: how do you rate a top notch restaurant and a local hot dog joint on the same day? It might not be possible, but I'm going to give it a shot anyways.M is the restaurant to go to for fine dining near downtown Columbus, as evidenced by the guy in the booth next to us that proposed to his girlfriend after dessert.The atmosphere is modern and very flowy with lots of curtains. Most importantly, the seats are very well padded. The lightning is appropriately dark, and you'll like it very much if you're a fan of the colors blue, purple and pink. We started with ""Shrimp Again"", shrimp, sweet potatoes and mushrooms covered in tempura batter and served with Thai dipping sauce and Asian sea salt. The shrimp was perfect (and possibly marinated), while the portabella and sweet potato were surprisingly good. The Thai sauce had the right mix of sweetness, sour and spice; the black sesame seeds provided a nice visual touch. This was followed up by our entrees, Chicken, and Diver Sea Scallops. The scallops weren't quite buttery as I've had them before, but they were seared properly. The lobster risotto was out-of-this-world amazing, and made perfect with the crunch of slightly bitter watercress. It was everything I hoped the main entree would be.What little I had of the chicken was also quite good. The bacon bits, in particular, provided a great deal of smokiness to the dish, while the chicken had great flavor.I'm not a wine guy, but our server, Emily, made great suggestions regarding wine pairings for both of us.On the side, we picked up the truffle mac n' cheese. The truffles aren't too much here, adding a wonderful earthy flavor to what would normally just be a really good, rich mac n' cheese. And then there was dessert. My coffee and fritters was, again, a big league dessert. There are apple chunks in the fritters, which are deep fried perfectly and sprinkled with the right amount of confectioners and turbinado sugar. The coffee is served semifreddo, which was something new to me, but thanks to the fine coffee grounds in the cup, tasted just like coffee. And the caramel and raspberry sauces served on the sides were similarly made right; nicely salted for the former, the right consistency for the latter.  My wife got the cupcakes. These were good, though the vanilla and red velvet cake mini-cupcakes proved toe the best of the five.For the first meal we've had in Columbus, M was a special treat, easily meeting and exceeding my expectations. I highly recommend it for anyone else passing through the area.",Robert G.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,2012/3/14,"Wow the food is amazing, if you're not ready to spend some money for great food than this isn't the place for you. It's a little pricy but definitely worth every bite. I love the surroundings, and be ready to dress to impress.",Tracy N.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,2008/11/10,"I decided to try M, but being on a limited budget I decided to sit at the bar and order a burger and a glass of wine.  A marquee martini, black orchid martini, samples of Lobster Mash and Truffle Mac & Cheese along with aforementioned wine and burger and my budget was sufficiently blown...and I was totally giddy.  I do understand that the location is somewhat hidden and the atmosphere intimidating, but being that you're in Ohio, the staff are not at all pretentious like you'd expect.  Their motto is something like ""service, service, service"" and I felt they fully exemplified it.  To wit, I was totally scrubby, in jeans and sneakers, having come from a full day of travel, and not for a second did I feel unwelcome due to my shoddy appearance.Cris is the master mixologist here, and she's won every award you can for mixing up the booze (think Iron Chef and Chopped for alcohol).  The black orchid martini is actually an edible flower frozen into a round piece of ice and served with some elderflower concoction.  Normally I think elderflower tastes like you're drinking perfume while kissing grandma, but this was t-a-s-t-y.  The Marquee martini has compressed foam or something in it, with an M drawn onto the top, and yeah, that was gone in a matter of minutes.  Now I was really getting to know Cris, who isn't just there to ply me with (actually, they're pretty weak- hence the mass consumption) designer drinks; she is also a really good bartender who upsells the restaurant and anticipates the drinks needs of her regulars.  Nice, Cris, nice.The kobe beef burger, at $16, is likely one of the best values I've ever had.  No, typically you don't need to spend this much on a burger, but I don't care how much you have to spend in order to enter that state of euphoria in which you're actually giggling while eating, marveling at how freaking happy each perfect bite makes me, and taking photographs of the food.  The fries are light and crispy, and spritzed with truffle oil, which is luxurious but somewhat unnecessary.Then I just had to ask for samples of the Lobster Mash and Truffle Mac.  The lobster was just meh; the potatoes were a little dry and I basically ate the lobster off the top and gave the rest back.  But that Truffle Mac was...life altering...like last meal-of-your-life-and-die-happy good.  I was stuffed to the point of threads tearing in my pants but I ate every bite.  Apparently it contains about 400 calories per spoonful thanks to its combination of several cheeses, heavy cream, beer, and possibly pixie dust and unicorn horn, but that's how good it is.  I'd go back with a friend and split the burger and mac next time for sure.  Now with that being said, if the rest of the food at M is just as delectable, I'm going to be in BIG trouble both thanks to needing both bigger pants and a bigger wallet.",Anna G.,,,,,,

However, the area's right in front of the bar, and the big modern leather seats weren't very comfy, so I asked to be seated in the dining area. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gmIyAldUFb9e8ekRYtGsow?select=0VWHCUtr2gSV0I3TrrKf3QTo keep it concise, here's my night:1. Fuji still water, $6.75I didn't realize I was charged for the water until I got the bill. On hindsight, I think my server did say tap at the end, but I might not have heard since it was mumbled.

Vanilla Brulee, compliments of the chef http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gmIyAldUFb9e8ekRYtGsow?select=thoD9m7f9RR70-_EUUCvZwDelish. One of the better creme brulees I've had. They even put a birthday candle on the whipped cream.Service was spot-on, and pacing was good. I was out of there in just under two hours. Decor is quite pretty, especially the draperies for some of the tables (this place is a great place for special occasions, hint hint). The only odd thing was that their restroom is actually outside of the restaurant, around the corner of the hallway.The valet guy was pretty funny too when I picked up my car; he was watching Hell's Kitchen, and we talked about that for a minute or two. Then when he came back with the car, he said ""there's your f$@king car"" in a really bad British accent. At the end of it, I was absolutely stuffed.

M at Miranova,194,4,4,2008/12/12,"This is one of the best restaurants in downtown Columbus (along with Sidebar 122 and DeNovo).As Cameron Mitchell's flagship restaurant, you will not be disappointed (may need to save some extra cash though, a little pricey). The decor is fantastic with an outdoor terrace overlooking the Scioto riverfront. Housed in the Miranova complex (where many Columbus celebretaies live including living-legend, Fmr. Senator and Astronaunt John Glenn). It is common place to find cars parked outside that cost more than your house like Aston Martins. But, what I like about M, is that the staff treat everyone the same, no matter what you drove up in. First the cocktails are incredible here and the bartenders have won many national awards. The cocktail menu includes housemade onics and bitters as well as signature cocktails that are beyond incredible. My favorite is the Black Orchid which has Belbedere Black Rasberry, St. Germain, white cranberry and fresh lime juice complete with an edible frozen flower. The food menu is also equally incerdible. I ordered king crab poached in butter as an appitizer. Mouth watering is an under statement. For the main course, I had sea scallops with parmesan risotto, roasted pork in a brown cream sauce. All were beyond fantastic! The service exceeds first-rate, and suitable for the Queen herself. Would recommend dressing up and expecting to pay (at least) $100+ for two.  Even though M has a very impressive wine list, as with all Cameron Mitchell restaurants, the wine prices are outrageous! More than triple retail price! It's an insult to people that know wine, but unfortunately is common among most restaurants. If it was not for the outrageous wine prices, I would have given M five stars. I've decided to take a stand and deduct one star when I review restaurants if they gouge customers on wine prices; it really is insulting. So consider this a five-star review with a star deducted for the wine prices. Sidebar 122's wine list is comparable, but their wine prices are about 2% above retail, which is very respectful to customers.",Tom B.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,4/14/15,"Let me start with saying I have never been disappointed by any means every time I visit this place! Please take that statement seriously! From valet, to superb service, food, the ambiance, it's certainly an experience. The most romantic restaurant in Columbus by my standard (I've been to them all). I don't even know where to start. It's beautiful, the lights are low, your surrounded by luxurious drapery, and you enjoy dinner by candle light. I've been here more times than I can count and for everything from happy hour, large dinner parties, to a romantic summer's night date on the patio. The server's know this menu like a living breathing book. Anything you want or need to know, they know. The signature drinks are what I dream about until the next time I visit. Before I hit my seat i'm ordering a Black Orchid. Seriously, try this, it's what you've been missing your entire adult life. The food is not just beautiful but delicious! Every single time! Try the King Crab appetizer because all of the work that goes into eating fresh crab is done. Shelled and soaking in warm butter, all you have to do is devour it. Pricey, sure maybe since I go well into ordering 4-5 Black Orchid's. You get what you pay for, and i'll happily do it every time. Classy, put something nice on and really indulge.

M at Miranova,194,4,2,2003/9/12,"What kind of restaurant is M?  It's the kind of place that is beautifully appointed and inexplicably lit with garish neon that cycles through a nuclear rainbow of colors so slowly you wonder, ""What the fuck is going on?""  It's the kind of restaurant that had a Dead Tissue Seminar in full view of the dining room, the video screens for which were hidden by far too transparent curtains. (I shit you not.  When we pointed it out to our waiter, a medical probe graphically digging into blackened flesh, he apologized, laughed, and said, ""We've had so much worse."")  It's the kind of restaurant that will charge you nine dollars for an order of french fries, ketchup, and garlic mayonnaise, and misspell ""aioli"" on the menu.That's not to say it doesn't almost excel.  Truthfully, every one of our dishes (save for the King Crab starter) could have been excellent if not for easily remedied mistakes.  Sadly, though, every one of them, save for that starter, had a problem that undermined it.  M is a restaurant defined by its near-misses.To start off, our server (and the people who refilled water and helped bring the courses) were wonderful.  They could not have been nicer or more attentive.We began with cocktails: Amy had the surprisingly good London Greyhound (Beefeater gin, pink peppercorn infused St. Germain elderflower, fresh grapefruit juice, and a haphazard rim of Himalayan sea salt).  I had their margarita, made of Herradurra Silver, jalapeÌ±o infused agave nectar (a really great idea), fresh lime juice, and (yet again) a hit-and-miss rim of smoked sea salt.  These drinks set the tone for our evening: fantastic ingredients, but poorly executed (even Chi-Chi's was able to salt the rim of a glass).For appetizers we had the King Crab and the ""Foie"".  The crab was ""[b]utter poached Dutch Harbor Alaskan King Crab"" with a giant bay leaf, and it was served in a glass cask.  This was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the best thing we were served at M.  The accompanying crostini was an afterthought.The foie gras (with pork belly confit, black lentil ragout, truffle pate, and a cherry jus), on the other hand, was full of Almosts.  It hadn't been seared long enough, leaving the texture static rather than giving it contrasting dynamics.  The lentils were room temperature and underdone, and the cherry jus was just savory, neither sweet nor tart enough to compliment the foie. It was Almost there, just poorly executed.  (The pork belly, though, was fine.)Our main course featured the salmon for me, and one of the specials, rock lobster tails, for Amy.  My salmon (with housemade gnocchi, lobster (claw meat), haricot vert, forest mushrooms, tomato fondue (i.e., tomato paste), and a lemon vin blanc) was perfectly cooked and had a delectable crust.  This was the second best dish of the night, as it was actually successful (and the correct temperature)... aside from the last bite.  There was a single bit of lobster claw shell that I discovered with my final bite that literally drew blood from the roof of my mouth.  Because that's what you want from a restaurant.Amy's lobster tails were a mess.  The main problem was that they were poorly cooked: the outside edges were medium-well while the interior was rare.  The sauce for the tails was a savory crab meat cream sauce that it didn't really go, flavor-wise, with the lobster.  Amy longed for the drawn butter that had been advertised when she ordered the lobster, if only to have something that would accentuate, rather than obliterate, the taste of her entree.The ""Mac-N-Cheese"" (ÌÊ la carte with Tillamook cheddar and black truffles) wasn't anywhere near hot enough.  I have no idea if it was good or not: it just wasn't hot, and possibly the right temperature would have saved this leaden brick.We decided to order dessert, it being our anniversary and all, Amy ordered a port, and I ordered the wonderful dessert wine trio. For dessert we had what M calls Apple Pie (""[w]arm apples, almond crumbles, Apple Jack ice cream (vanilla bean ice cream mixed with Apple Jack Liquor), and cider caramel""). Perhaps we should have been warned by the description that this would only be ""warm"" rather than ""hot"", and like our other too-cool courses, the dessert suffered as a result: it should have been piping.  The flavors were nice, but this dessert was completely forgettable.There were so many opportunities for M to shine, but there wasn't a single dish that didn't have something wrong with it.  Food at this level (and by ""at this level"" I mean ""at this price"") shouldn't have these problems.  (Amy said, upon reading this, she would have given the place a B+ had it been half as expensive.)  It's not too much to expect food to be served at proper temperatures, to expect shells to be completely removed, and to expect to have a dinner that doesn't have a floor show involving a dead tissue video.  M is almost good.  But almost doesn't count here.  At all.",G. Benjamin E.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,3,2003/4/13,"The decorations of this place is a little intimidating. High ceilings, low light, wall curtains, large vases with large flowers. I do have to agree with some of the reviews below - they are trying a little too hard. With that said, I do work in the same building. So happy hour is what draws me there. Everyday from 5-7pm, $5 well drinks with a small list of food specials. Their sushi specials are sub-par but their Beef Sliders are tasty. And the bartenders can whip up a mean Old Fashioned. I probably wouldn't come here if it weren't for the convenience.",Tiffany Y.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,6/29/14,"This is the place to go for happy hour if you want to class it up without breaking the bank. They have a cocktail list of 5 to 6 drinks (martini, Moscow mule, Gin Gimlet,  etc) all at $5 a piece. To accompany the drinks they have a great list of small plates ranging from $5 - about $10 and they are worth every penny.",Raymond S.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,2,2001/5/12,"Came here for New Year's Eve and it was a full house, as expected. Valet was kind enough, we were kindly told to sit at the bar after we arrived at 7:05 for a 7:15 reservation. At 7:21, we were taken to our table. At the bar, I saw some guy leaving and he had just signed off on a $51 credit card receipt leaving a $50 tip. I thought to myself the drinks must be amazing, and so ordered a London Greyhound, one of their ""signature"" drinks. Greyhounds are pretty standard I thought, but I didn't like it at all. Service was fine though.When we were seated, I didn't really like the proximity to other tables, and this place was said to have a view, but after the sun sets, it's just darkness outside, you can't even see the river or anything for that matter. You'd think an upscale place like this would have some type of lighting outdoors. The interior is like a trance lounge, purple, red and blue ambient lighting that changes periodically, with purple being the dominant color, accompanied by music that had me scratching my head at times. I also imagined the place to be several stories up, but it's on the first floor.The waiter, Keith, was quite friendly, as expected, and announced the night's feature, which was an 8 oz filet with lobster. He failed to tell me the price, but I ordered it because surf and turf is my thing, and I couldn't help but frown when I saw it was $48. There was a large group next to us sitting at a round table and we were only separated from them by two feet with a thin semi-see through veil between us, seemed to be populated by a lot gay people at the time, and they were quite rowdy.On to the food: we ordered Lobster Mashed potatoes, which came out not even room temperature, it wasn't anything special. We had the Surf and Turf sushi roll, which wasn't anything special either. You're allowed to substitute any of the starches or veggies that come with your entrees because they make everything from scratch. Keith forgot that my date wanted asparagus instead of spinach but was quick to fix it as soon as he checked up on us. The steaks here were the only thing worthy of 5 stars. Two filet entrees (one with lobster), a side of lobster mashed potatoes, a sushi roll, and a ""London Greyhound"" ran the bill to 148The reason I gave the place 2 stars is because it doesn't blow you away. I've done quite of bit of fine and casual dining in Columbus as well as Los Angeles, and it just doesn't blow you away. Great service yes, but you're paying for it, so you don't get extra points for me at a place like this for service. Superior table service should come standard. For an occasion, splurge here, yes, but I wouldn't come back. It's not a deal by any means, there are plenty of places in Columbus where you would walk away with the same experience paying quite a bit less, being twice as satisfied, with food just as good if not better, with fewer douchebags trying to be high class, and obnoxious homosexuals (I'm not a homophobe). The restaurant shouldn't get marked down for it's clientele, but that is what you will find here, so fair warning if you're like me and put that kind of thought into your evening plans with a date. I'd say a simple girl would be impressed with the service and the venue, so make sure you have your goals in order when you try a new place and are reading Yelp for some field data.2.75 Stars.",Buhbee L.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,2,1/20/15,"One word review: disappointed. Made an 8 pm reservation for myself and two girlfriends for restaurant week. We waited for 1Hour before we were seated. Sixty minutes, despite a confirmed reservation. Not cool. Then received tomato basil bisque: too tart, warm-ish. Pork tenderloin with bordelaise sauce: meh. Chocolate lava cake and ice cream: no lava in cake. M needs to step up its game if it wants to attract patrons with good taste buds. Would've given it 1star, but their black orchid cocktail was quite good. Will not return.",Anisha M.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,2,2008/9/15,"I have never had anything bad to say about a Carmen Mitchell's but this place was awful. I had a large group go for happy hour when they open this weekend after the Latin festival @ 5pm .. we were the only large group in there for awhile.. happy hour is from 5-7 so you know that means if we want to get your drinks on we better order, well that didn't happen I wanted to order 2 drinks at a time just because I know that taking ordering for a large group will take forever but the server was like ""its against the law to order two drinks @ a time. "" what!! from there the serves was bad, from so many people bringing food out to us to different people bringing drinks out to us. I mean we could not even remember who our server was because we hardly never saw her and if we did see her we were asking for something that was forgotten and then still never getting what we ask for. When it was time to get our checks all hell broke loss, the server took almost two hours to bring us our checks to when she finally brought them every check was either messed up or right.. and when ask to correct the issue the server then would say "" O I'm so sorry let me fit that"". so we gave her another chance it happens.. then after waiting again for another 30 mins to an hour just to get our checks, the serve still came back with wrong checks. After 3 times of having our checks wrong we had people just walk out because we were there so long just waiting for checks. We had been there since 540pm and did not leave until almost 830pm and only had one or two drink for happy hour. When finally ask for the manager, which never came cause she was so busy which again it wasn't busy at all. We ask for the mgr 5 times to the servers to the point that the server kept saying "" please I don't want to get in trouble with my manager, because she was afraid to admit she was in the wrong or serves was horrible on her end."" Finally after we have a HR person in our mist and a lawyer, they both said to the server you need to stop saying that to us, when someone request a manager you need to get your manager, finally a manager came out and spoke to us.. and we explain everything that went wrong from the time we got here to the time we left. All the manager could do is say I'm sorry, "" I was busy helping with y'all ticket, to I came in the middle of the situation way to late, I should have gotten in the middle way sooner. I mean what manager doesn't came as soon as you request them at a high paid classy restaurant such as the CM!!! at the end of all this she said lets come to a poz situation ""what can we do to make this better? "" finally we all agreed you can comp us all for our meals and drinks and we would like all of our $$$ back.. which remember there was almost 10 ppl in our group.. (The mgr did comp us for everything and $$$ back and on top of that 2 free almost top of the line wine to go) .. I will never be returning.",Chadtheus C.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,3,2006/2/15,"One word comes to mind for me.... Overrated. Quickly followed by overpriced. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I wasn't overly impressed with the food. The sushi rolls were subpar, even for a place where sushi isn't the specialty. My kale salad was decent and probably the highlight of the meal, along with the Moscow Mule. My entree, the sea bass, was the most disappointing. The fish itself was seasoned okay, but the remainder of the dish was no good. Bland liquid surrounds some very awful tasting and textured shrimp dumplings, then some vegetable chunks and the fish seems to be plopped down into the liquid. The outstanding service (hostess, bartender and our server) is the only reason I opted for 3 stars instead of 2. It's possible that I simply ordered the wrong thing and the restaurant is actually great, but for the price I don't feel you can justify serving anything less than exquisite.",Suzanne P.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,3,4/25/12,"Maybe I am too harsh. Everyone I know loves this place. I've traveled the world and have a pretty good idea of what to expect in a dining experience. First we ordered some sushi for our table. Crab and tuna. Tasted more like they got it from krogers. I expected more from CM. My Caesar salad would rival Wendy's. I expected more from CM.  My Filet was good but I did not come to M for good.  I expect more from CM. Lastly the next day I involuntarily expelled more than my body weight . Unsure it was related. But coincidental??",Frank L.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,6/19/14,Loved this restaurant.  I had salmon and my colleagues had the tuna and scallops.  Each of us loved our selection. The combination of flavors was perfect.  We had the tuna rolls as appetizers - highly recommend.  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere was light and bright.  Wish it hadn't been so warm outside as the patio is very inviting.,Mike M.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,2007/10/11,"M is magical. M is magnificent. M is marvelous.For six years I've lived in Columbus and heard good things about M. I've wanted to try it, but I've stayed away for fear it would be stuffy, stodgy or pretentious. Last night was my first time experiencing M and I'm happy to say my fears were unfounded.We had a Disney calibre experience - and when I say that, I am paying the ultimate compliment. I'm a huge Disney fan. I love the idea of the ""happiest place on earth."" I love the perfection of Disney - not a petal or leaf out of place, all cast members (aka staff) flawlessly in character, and the seamless illusion that you've entered a perfect, magical world. Yes, Disney is expensive and out of reach for many - and so is M. That just makes me appreciate it even more when I get to go.Last night, we left the earth behind for a while. We were transported to a lovely, otherworldly plane with exquisite food and drink, impeccable service, and where every whim is catered to with swift and joyful precision. Our server, David, was like a brilliant actor playing a role into which he absolutely disappears. He never broke character - he was charming and splendid. He said ""we never say no here"" and proved it true. No matter what I asked for, he delivered it effortlessly and graciously to us.The food was amazing. We eat rather well in general - I love truly good food - and this did not disappoint. My drinks were ethereally lovely - I had the grape crush (muddled Concord grapes and lime juice, yum) and the black orchid (a light, citrus concoction poured over an orchid suspended in ice). The ice ball orchid became my precioussss for the evening. It was so beautiful and unique - I never wanted to leave it. I nursed that drink until the last second possible. I still miss my little ice ball orchid.In case you haven't gotten the picture yet, I'm a big kid in a grownup body. I would have hated M if it were all pretentious and stuffy. Instead, it was magic. The manager came over at one point because I had been taking delighted images of our drinks and food. He introduced himself, then grinned and said he had tried to get David, our server, to tell me that taking pictures at M is not allowed (David refused). I thought it was funny and was so happy to see that they have a sense of humor about things.I highly recomend the filet mignon, truffled mac and cheese side, black orchid drink and cracker jack dessert (three adorable, mini creme brulees in vanilla, caramel and peanut butter respectively). But you can't go wrong  here - and if you do, just let them know and they will bring you something else. If you don't see something you like on the menu, ask them for something you will like. They won't say no.I wish I could still be sitting at our lovely table at M, people-watching and bubbly with excitement over the incredible food, beautiful drinks and flawless service. But just like Disney, at some point you always have to leave the fantasy and go back home. I'm just glad to know that M exists and that next time we have a special occasion or rare and coveted date night with sitter, we've got a Disney-perfect getaway right here in Columbus.I do still miss my beautiful orchid ice ball, though.",Lara K.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,2/14/12,"Excellent service! Anne took care of us in the bar where we had sushi and wine, Johnny took care if us in the dining room. Food was fabulous, chef created my husband a surf and turf option! Beautiful ambiance!",Colette W.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,3,2007/11/15,"M...eh. Service was great, attentive and accommodating. The food was not as great as the price would indicate. The lobster cones tasted a little like the fridge.

M at Miranova,194,4,3,2005/6/15,"Had a business dinner here a few nights ago.  I had a chopped salad to start off with which was good not great. We also had the Alaskan king crab appetizer which was very good. The side dishes are not bad, I would recommend the lobster mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese. I think it is not worth the price you pay for an entree. I had the Chilean sea bass which is one of their ""signature"" dishes, again very average. The flavor was underwhelming. Maybe my expectations are high but I think for a place with the name and prestige surrounding this restaurant, I am not impressed. Will probably not be back.",Ron R.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,5,10/16/13,"One of the best fine dining restaurants in ohio. The steaks are fabulous, the wine list is enormous, and the sushi is worth getting every time.  They have good drinks, but I normally drink scotch there and they have great scotch pours (hard to come by seemingly).  The three cones appetizer is unique and outstanding.  The ambiance is awesome, with very high ceilings, big dividing drapes, and impressive lighting.

M at Miranova,194,4,5,2010/2/11,"M is superb. It's romantic, chic, and trendy. You'll pay for it, but on a splurge dinner for a special occasion it's absolutely worth it.

The entire menu is decadent and full of interesting flavor combinations. The head chef is truly a culinary wizard. Our service was spectacular and the server was absolutely spot on.

M at Miranova,194,4,3,7/24/11,"Checked out M at the insistance of a friend who's roommate is a server here. On first impression, the interior looks slightly gaudy and overdone. I don't think there is a parallel in Columbus really, maybe in Miami and some of the restaurants in Vegas, which is kinda what M is going for I believe. We were well taken care of. M has a nice outdoor patio area where we were served our drinks, someone recommended I try the M 'Marquee' which consisted of : Belvedere Cytrus, Cointreau Noir, Agave nectar, Blood orange puree and lemon juice and it was very good. We were then served a sushi platter, I believe one of the kinds was the surf n turf and dont remember what the other was. Wasn't too impressed. I dislike cream cheese in Sushi and the sushi here provided plenty of it. There's way better sushi joints in this city, I'd recommend staying away from it here.For my entree I ordered the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. The marinated portobello and seared spinach were good sides. I swapped out the mashed potatoes for some garlic roasted red potatoes (Not on the menu but was told the chef is happy to accomodate requests). My only gripe was that the filet and the sides were way too salty.All in all not a bad experience. I wouldn't return here for a casual weeknight outing, I think the place is pricey and not all that casual and relaxed. Place is great for a celebratory night out, formal date etc. though.",Monish D.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,2/19/09,"After Marcella, we decided on getting after hour drinks and a nibble at M lounge.  From the time we pulled up to the round about to the time we left, the setting was unreal.  Just to get there, you have to make a side turn from the main streets and tall buildings, and out of nowhere you pull into a magnificent complex.  As I walked down the long corridor to the restaurant, I felt like an elites entering a secret meeting.  Miranova just had that secluded and gentry feeling.So I ordered the lobster tacos and blue basil cocktail.  The taco was interesting and the shell on the taco was on sweet side.  I didn't care too much for the avocado creme fraiche, it just reminded me too much of the fake guacamole dips you get at grocery stores.  The blue basil was well made but I felt it was missing some element, maybe just a touch of tart.  I think M can take it a step above and infuse their own vodkas instead of using stoli or incorporate some house made bitters.  But the drink that really blew me away was the Hot Buttered Rum!  I don't order too many toddy drinks but this was just excellent.  This drink alone and the great atmosphere at M would be enough reason for me to drive 6 hours.",Luan N.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,2,4/16/15,"I've been a fan for quite awhile - I love the spot for evening drinks, a nice meal, or even a happy hour.  Sadly, last week I went to happy hour and had less than mediocre sushi (think not so fresh to the point of being off) and horrible cocktails (how do you make a moscow mule undrinkable?)  That food/drink experience was topped off by a bartender who was less than friendly.   Altogether, I was left with zero desire to return to M in the future.

M at Miranova,194,4,3,6/19/11,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the service at this restaurant. Being from Manhattan, I am notoriously picky and hard to please and my Columbus hotel had been such a tragic failure that frankly I didn't know what to expect of this place. The interior is a bit overdone and dramatic -- it felt a bit Miami-esque/trying too hard (I later learned that the builder of the Miranova builds in Miami). Our waiter was wonderful and I was impressed with his attentiveness and skill. Even in NYC where standards are high, it can be hard to find someone who really understands what good service is, and our guy nailed it. The food....was it the most amazing meal I've ever had in my entire life? No. Was it very good and pretty well executed? Mostly. A few dishes were over-salted (like my tuna entree) but I was too busy enjoying the evening with my dinner companion to care. We were so stuffed on the food and wine that we passed on dessert. If you're used to very very high end cuisine, you will find this place to be more middle of the road in terms of food...good, servicable, but not life changing. If you tend to eat at chain restaurants then this place will likely blow your mind. Also, I can't speak to prices since I didn't pay and I barely glanced at the menu but I think they are on-par with prices in the area.",Marissa S.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,2,7/25/15,"Came here for the first time tonight to celebrate my birthday with my husband and was just not impressed. I had heard so many wonderful things about M and was definitely let down. My husband ordered from the Restaurant Week menu (salmon) and I ordered from the regular menu (scallops). The food was very good, but not worth what you're paying. I've had much better meals at Hyde Park for the same price. But what really killed it for me was the service. Our server started out great, very attentive, offering suggestions, etc. Then our meals arrived and it went downhill from there. We never received the lobster mashed potatoes we ordered and he never offered to get us another drink. For dessert he just assumed I would be sharing with my husband from the RW menu (which I wasn't going to) so he never showed us a dessert menu or even asked if we wanted coffee, port, etc. These just seemed like very basic things that even the most casual restaurants do and the fact that it wasn't done here was very disappointing.",Jen H.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,2003/2/8,"On Friday, February 29th myself and a group of 7 other people attended dinner at M at Miranova.  The eight of us were from places varying from Wisconsin to Toronto to Miami to NYC to New Jersey to right here in Columbus and we were all together for a nice dinner after the Arnold.  As an experienced diner and the only person from Columbus, I suggested M and I could not have been more pleased with the food, the service, or my group's experience.First, the decor was beautiful.  With slowly changing overhead lighting as well as slashes of light emanating from the wine rack in the front combined with low light chandeliers in the back of the restaurant created an elegant yet trendy look without feeling stuffy.  The staff was dressed elegantly and everything at the table appeared polished and high quality and the noise level was wonderful for conversation.As most had only arrived that day and were busy with hotel reservations, two members of the group arrived early and two late.  Those who arrived early were treated to great cocktails at the bar and those arriving late were ushered to our table in the beautiful 'barrel room' without hassle.Nate, our server, was outstanding in explaining the menu and was fantastic at knowing when to offer suggestions and when to give the diner time to decide.  Nothing felt rushed at all.  Additionally, as the menu frequently changes, one of our diners had noted Watermelon sushi in the past and being from New York was disappointed to discover it had recently left the menu.  To my amazement, the waiter left and returned shortly to inform us that they could make the roll and that someone had been sent to pick up a Watermelon.  Never have I experienced such service. I was and still am in awe.While I cannot comment on everything on the menu, I will note that my fellow diners were particularly pleased with the 'Soup' of Roasted Tomato and Chevre Crostini, The 'Beef' of Mini Kobe Burgers w/ Carmelized Onions, and Cheddar, and the 'Poke' with Big Eye Tuna, Avocado, Ginger Soy, and Wasabi Sorbet.  The Steak in a Bowl was described as 'incredible' by all three diners who experienced it and both the Surf n' Turn Roll and Watermelon Roll were enjoyed. Very full, only 2 desserts were ordered, the coffee and donuts by one and the Bread Pudding by myself.  Less highly thought of items included the Three Cones which were ""too sweet,"" the Wild salmon which was 'average,' and the coffee and donuts which were simply coffee and warm fried pieces of apple and bread with dipping sauce.I personally opted for a starter of the 'Crab' She-Crab Bisque with Blue Crab BLT and Basil Aioli.  The dish was plated beautifully and although small, incredible in taste and texture.  The soup was pureed crab and butter, plus basil and each taste melded perfectly while maintaining its originality.  The Blue Crab BLT was even better than the soup, in my opinion, and the taste of Crab exploded from the tiny sandwich in the same way that the Lobster at SPAGO explodes from the Lobster BLT.As a main, I chose the Black Cod with Lobster Ravioli, Green Asparagus, and Sweet Corn Emulsion.  Plated simply, the flawlessly broiled fish was served topped with very tender and flavorful asparagus on top of a bed of 4 Lobster Ravioli and a base layer of the Corn.  The flavors each persisted on their own, but also complimented one another eaten as a whole.  The lobster Ravioli were as good as any I've ever experienced and the corn emulsion could be served as a dessert in a lesser restaurant.In addition to my main, I opted for the Lobster Mashed Potatoes which were simple, utilizing a creamy potato and garlic oil, topped with warm whole chunks of lobster.  Having had this dish only 2 weeks prior at Mastro's in Los Angeles, I can definitively say I preferred the M presentation, flavor, and pricetag.For dessert, a friend and I split the Banana Bread Pudding described as 'Layered in Butterscotch Banana custard, Cashew Toffee, and Roasted Banana Gelato.'  As Bread pudding is in my top two favorite desserts along with Tiramisu, I have experienced multiple presentations and will say that M's interpretation was amongst the top two or three along with the version's at Emeril's in Orlando and Lolita's Lust in Toronto.  The gelato was understated yet complimented the saltiness of the saltiness of the cashews beautifully while the bread pudding was a tastefully heavy banana bread coated in a delectably smooth butterscotch custard.All told, everyone was pleased, including those with upscale 'big city' eating experience.  For myself, the meal ranked on the same level as meals at restaurants like Il Mulino in New York and Spago in Los Angeles, as well as the Emeril's Franchised restaurants in Orlandoand Las Vegas, and the service was even better.  If there is better dining to be had in Columbus (or anywhere in Ohio,) I've yet to find it.",Michael U.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,2006/9/11,"I went here with my daughter who was celebrating her 21st birthday and my other daughter.

The food was great, not huge portions but satisfying and delicious.The only thing that was sort of a bummer was when we left we had to pay $6 for valet parking, there are no other choices to park.  After a $300 bill, seems to me they could throw in the parking.",Victoria A.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,11/23/14,"Fantastic restaurant, in all respects.  Service is great -- not at all snooty (which I've found in some upscale restaurants), prompt and friendly.  The restaurant is beautiful & classy, perfect for a special evening out with the significant other.  Ambiance is amazing, with candles, low lighting and flowing curtains between sections.  The foot was seriously the best that we've found in Columbus -- my husband said his steak was probably the best he's ever had, and the salmon dinner was amazing.  Seriously, cannot recommend this restaurant fast enough -- go now!",Julie G.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,1,1/24/10,"I realize that the majority of people who go to M have a great experience, sad to say I did not.  A group of women decided to go to M for restaurant week so I was dragged along by a friend.  I wasn't thrilled by the fixed price menu so I decided to make selections from the real menu.  I chose two of the sushi rolls, the rock & roll and wasabi, to have as an entree.  Since I didn't select an appetizer the waitress almost insisted that I choose something so I didn't have to sit there and watch them eat.  I declined and had the bread instead.  The waitress was kind enough to shout into my ear as I asked her questions, apparently no one discussed how to use your indoor voice when serving.  It wasn't pleasant...Then the sushi came out and I have to say that they tried to present it well but it was lacking.  I realize that Cameron Mitchell isn't a sushi chef, but I wasn't expecting to be let down.  The rock & roll, made with tuna, salmon, and eel was lacking in taste and the eel was too chewy.  It literally felt like I was chewing on fat rather than fish.  When I made a comment to the waitress, rather than try to assist me she told me it wasn't what I was used to.  Being the opinionated woman that I am, I may have made some comments about my disappointment to my friends.  The manager came over but I was too nervous to tell her my true feelings.  As for the wasabi roll, only one piece contained any wasabi peas so all of the kick was concentrated in that piece, it was shocking when I ate it.When it came time for dessert, everyone at the table had the mini cupcakes but I couldn't convince myself to try any of the desserts on the menu.  The chocolate lava cake reminded me of what I had at Cameron's American Bistro, seeing as I was disappointed there I didn't want a repeat.  I went with a glass of muscato to tide me over and nibbled on a friends cupcakes.  They were definitely interesting, but I only enjoyed two of the five (the green tea really isn't my style and I noticed several of the women didn't eat theirs).I'm sad to say this was the least favorite of all of the Mitchell restaurants (and I've been to most).  For the price I would have expected quite a bit more.  The interior decorating is lovely, but that was the only positive to the experience.  I won't be returning, I think I'll stick to my CM favorites.",Michelle K.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,3,4/30/10,"Ok, here's the deal.  I gave this place three stars because the ambiance and decor is awesome.  Totally top notch, and kudos to the interior designer.Now for the food...  The word ""Meh"" comes to mind.  I had the steak frites, and my guest had the ahi tuna.  Tuna was obviously frozen at one point, which is understandable for Ohio.  The steak was tough and not cooked to spec.  I ordered rare and got something in the range of medium well.  It was tough, and there were parts that my steak knife just couldn't cut through.We also go the mac/cheese and creamed spinach sides.  Mac/Cheese was really runny and had a sauce that was just orange enough enough to take me back to my college days with the Kraft box and a hot plate.  The creamed spinach was, in a nutshell, horrible.  The primary taste was bacon.  So if you like bacon fat, by all means...order the spinach.  But just know that it doesn't taste like spinach, and it doesn't taste like anything but bacon.  There must be a lot of bacon in this dish.  Maybe if you get a coupon this place would be a good place to eat.  Or if you're on an expense account.  But I have to imagine that there are other restaurants in Columbus that you could find that maybe don't have the fancy decor but have better food.  I'd probably pass on this one.",Edward k.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,5/21/07,"M is Cameron Mitchell's marquee restaurant, as in very upscale, and is meant to be a true ""fine dining experience"".  The restaurant is located in the Miranova office tower off Mound St., a few blocks west of High in downtown Columbus.  There's no outdoor parking in the area, so come prepared with $5 in cash for the parking garage, or use the valet.the restaurant itself is located on the first floor of the office tower, just around the corner from the elevator to the garage.  When entering the restaurant, stop to take a look around before checking your coats.  The interior of the restaurant is incredibly decorated, with sweeping mixed woods, hanging fabrics and constantly shifting colored lighting, which strikes off the hanging white fabrics to change the overlying colors of the entire atmosphere.  The interior decoration definitely presents a very upscale mood, without seeming stuffy and ""black tie"" as can sometimes happen at other high-level restaurants.  Reservations are recommended, but may not be required, especially on a weeknight, when we were seated immediately.  There's no posted dress-code, but at LEAST business-casual is recommended.As with many high-end restaurants, the menu changes regularly, but it's anchored by several prime cuts of steak, lamb, and lobster tail, along with a more rotating selection of 5-10 featured entrees.  It's in those entrees, as well as the appetizers, that the chef's creations really shine.  Look for the lobster cones and mini kobe-beef burger appetizers (served with fries, in a brilliant presentation).  For entrees, it's hard to go wrong with the scallops, but for those that don't enjoy seafood, the chicken dishes are excellent as well.Worth mentioning on it's own - despite NOT being primarily a sushi establishment, M has one of my absolute all-time favorite sushi rolls: their ""Surf and Turf"" roll.  Tempura shrimp, rolled inside-out with a scallion, sprouts, cream cheese, and topped with the most tender slices of filet mignon that just absolutely melt in your mouth.  If you're a sushi lover, do NOT MISS THIS.  Desserts are excellent, but not *quite* as stand-out as the rest of the menu - Cameron Mitchell's excellent Creme Brulee is featured, as always, along with a fun Root Beer Float presentation, a coffee & donuts (with dipping sauces), and other options.The menu and atmosphere aren't the extent of the excellent experience that is M.  The service at M is superb, doing everything to make sure the experience is truly top notch.  Table settings are only for the current course, and naturally used silverware and dishes are cleared and replaced with new (and appropriate) silverware and dishes for the next course.  Our server was particularly knowledgeable of the menu and very polite and welcoming, putting me at ease even as I'm stumbling over trying to say ""seared sea scallops"".  A sign of the true dedication to service, going above and beyond anything I've previously seen, was a Thank You note from our server for the good comments we left on the comment card, received in the mail just a few days later.With an incredible atmosphere, excellent high-class menu, and superb service, the only real downside to M is the price.  The price isn't unreasonable in comparison with similar restaurants (such as The Refectory and the high-class steak houses), but is definitely more than high enough to prevent frequent visits.  The location and parking situation are somewhat disappointing as well, as the price remains the same for valet or non-valet parking, and the downtown location is not the most traffic-friendly.  Despite those downfalls, M is highly recommended as a wonderful dining experience, perfect for special occasions or a nice evening getaway.",Max T.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,2,8/13/11,"My partner brought me to M on my birthday, my second in Columbus. We sat outside, albeit the winds threatened a good fight with our napkins. But it was June. Sitting inside felt sacrilegious. We ordered the scallops. I don't usually order scallops because few places make them well: soft, almost like pudding. But I assumed it'd be a safe bet here. Unfortunately, my assumptions were wrong. The scallops were hard and lacked flavour. I had higher expectations for the dollar sign they attached their dishes, and they didn't deliver. I will say the service was superb. I wasn't going to make a big deal out of my dislike of the food, but the server noticed and insisted she bring me a different dish. I succumbed and ordered the pork chop, a more universally safe dish; a dish we had shared at Third and Hollywood on my birthday the year before. I wish I could say it turned my experience at M around, but unfortunately no. The sauce was well prepared, but the meat itself was dry and flavourless. They brought out complimentary mashed potatoes with lobster tail which were, well, just weird. But a nice gesture. In the end, the food was mediocre, not terrible. But I was expecting more. We weren't charged for the scallops or the potatoes. In a restaurant I care not at all for ambience; what I value in restaurants is the food; good service should come naturally out of the staff's love for the product. Neither the scallops nor the pork chop felt well prepared, made with love. And that's okay for some folks, but not for me. I forgot to mention the mac and cheese. So good. We may come back for some more of that.",Catalina G.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,2003/8/11,"Ive only been here twice. Both times I had a filet, so i can not speak to the rest of the menu, but my steak was good. atmosphere is superb. service was good.only thing i can complain about is price. Its just too expensive.",David E.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,4,8/23/09,"I came here last night for dinner, all by my lonesome.  was greeted by a somewhat surly hostess who didn't even want to my my name on the list until I insisted.  So I went to the bar and decided to eat there rather than wait 40 minutes for a table.I started with the mini-burgers and an order of their truffled mac and cheese.  The burgers were delicious and each had their own set of toppings.  And the buns were perfectly sized to the burgers, very tiny.  The mac and cheese was a little too cheesey for me but good.I then ordered a Wasabi roll.  This didn't live up to expectations.  It wasn't bad but wasn't any better than I could get at any sushi bar.And that was enough food for me.  All appetizers.  I knocked off a star for poor service by both the hostess and the barmaid.",Paul F.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,2009/4/8,"My wife and I went here for our second wedding anniversary.  We were here in the middle of the week, so the restaurant was not particularly busy.  I had the kobe beef sliders as an appetizer and the ahi tuna as a main course.  My wife had the potstickers and the steak in the bowl.For desert, I had the chocolate lava cake and my wife had the ""donuts and coffee.""The food was excellent and the service was outstanding.  This was easily one of the best meals we've eaten in Columbus.  Highly recommended.",Vin R.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,3,2005/8/10,"I may be stepping on some toes here, but this ""at-first-glance"" 5-star restaurant doesn't make you feel so special once your night is done.  I have never been impressed by the service, having been made to wait at the bar more than once when I could clearly see there were a number of open tables.  The other patrons in the bar, dressed like they should be on an MTV reality show, did not smile much, nor give me the time of day. I did not smile after spending $15 on a mediocre martini.  Once seated it is hard not to be wow'd by your surroundings - the building's interior is sure to wow a date.  As a connoisseur of value, however, the view is where the wowing ends.  All the food is good, and the best meal I've ever had at M was the ahi tuna, which was exceptional. The caveat being I've spent much less on seared ahi elsewhere that I would claim is just as good.The wine list was impressive but overpriced, though they did have some hard to find bottles if you have the dough to dish-out to get them.It's a very cool place to celebrate a special occasion that you want to be visually memorable, but I see no reason to go back.",Anthony C.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,3,2003/3/13,"Went here Friday night, valet parked and strolled inside. I'm first not a fan of the restrooms. ..kinda janky for such a ""nice"" restaurant.  This place is god for a one time visit but not a place I would be a regular.  I've had better food and dessett for much less. There are better C.M. restaurants in the area.

Our waitress (admittedly, it was her first day on the job) had difficulties getting our champagne open.  Kinda lame but oh well, great other than that.

M at Miranova,194,4,5,2007/8/10,"As far as my experiences go, M is the best fine-dining restaurant in Columbus.  The first impression as you walk in the door is unmatched, with the subtle lighting that changes colors, the long, graceful curtains, and large picture windows that offer a great view of downtown and, now, the unique Main Street bridge.  A friend who lives in Manhattan and is used to high-powered meals with TV network bigshots was even impressed, describing the decor as ""stunning.""  It's a decidely modern setting, with none of the stodginess that's sometimes associated with fine dining.  The food, however, is the highlight.  I'm continually surprised at the new takes M's chefs come up with for traditional dishes.  My wife and I, if finances allow, come here every Valentine's Day and have been for nearly a decade, and I'm always excited to see what's new on the menu.  Everything I've tried, from salads and appetizers to the entrees and desserts and even sushi has been superb.  The desserts, in particular, are always interesting, with upscale takes on coffee and donuts, root beer floats, cupcakes and more.The service has always been friendly and professional.  The only problem I've had here is having been asked to wait at the bar for up to 15 minutes, despite having reservations, but that's only happened once or twice.  If I had unlimited resources, M would be my first choice for a meal in Columbus.",Dennis L.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,6/21/12,"For me, this is the ""special occasion"" go-to in Columbus. Hubby and I decided to celebrate our birthdays, so we made a reservation here. Everything was spectacular, from the wine list to the crabmeat appetizer, to the entrees, to the heavenly Woodford Reserve milkshake. I had the filet mignon, which was expertly cooked, and my husband had the sea bass, which he loved. The service was very attentive, but she didn't hover, which is one of my pet peeves. Noise level was moderate, as one would expect at a place like this. I have dined all over the world, and M is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere.",Teresa H.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,3,6/29/10,"Let me start by saying that I really, really wanted to love this place.  The dinner posted online looked very enticing with some very creative combinations.  After reading the reviews, I thought it would be a perfect place to take my fellow foodie fiancÌ© for his birthday on our visit to Columbus.  Welll, I wasn't all wrong...The restaurant is located in the swanky Miranova condo building in downtown Columbus.  The decor and ambiance is breathtaking and definitely fits the building it's in.  We were VERY impressed with its modern, lounge-y feel.  Kudos to the interior designer.  (Guys, if you want to make a girl feel fancy, this place will do the trick!)It did not take long for us to be sat at 9:00 PM on a Friday night, and we were placed in a spacious corner booth.  My man and I ordered drinks, a Sterling Vineyards Merlot for him and their ""award-winning"" Ginger Hibiscus gin cocktail.  The cocktail was Absolutely incredible--refreshing, just sweet enough, and visually appealing complete with a candied hibiscus flower floating in the chilled martini glass.  We pleasantly sipped on our drinks while we salivated through the menu.There was a fixed 3 course menu as an alternative to ordering off the dinner menu, which included some of the same offerings as the main menu, making dining there much more affordable.  We decided to go for the gusto, however, and order off the entrÌ©e menu.We started with the Wasabi sushi roll as an appetizer, which consisted of a tuna and (i think) salmon roll encrusted in wasabi peas.  The first two pieces I tasted were not bad, but not necessarily out of the ordinary.  The third piece, however, was absolutely unacceptable.  It was as if all of the wasabi in the roll was concentrated in that one bite.   Now let me say, I love my sushi, and I like my sushi with some wasabi However, the wasabi was SO overwhelming that I found it hard to breathe, my eyes started instantly watering, and I even felt a numbness at the base of my neck.  I think my fiancÌ© was a little scared that his fiery, spice-loving Mexican was about to pass out.  It was so disappointing.  As for the entrÌ©es, I ordered a miso-marinated Chilean sea bass with shiitake mushrooms and shrimp dumplings all in a light Thai broth.  The dish was actually good, don't get me wrong.  Maybe it was just the fact that this delicate fish was a little overwhelmed by the miso flavoring.  The mushrooms and little shrimp dumplings were very tasty and really absorbed the broth well.  Not live-changing, but good.  My birthday boy ordered the ahi tuna with foie gras, chili spinach, and a port wine reduction.  Again, it was by no means a bad dish; however, the ingredients just did not seem to marry together as well as we had hoped for (especially at $30+ a pop).   It was like a lot of good ideas without cohesion. Besides the wasabi roll, I would say not too shabby.  But then again, for the price, I think more attention to detail is a must.  Besides the decor and the cocktail, ""wow"" wasn't really what came to mind.",Valeria G.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,3/27/12,"M.  As good as ever in all areas.  Plus, they know how to put together a table celebration.  We arrived on a lazy Monday night with three celebrations, and everyone, and I mean everyone, went out of their way to make it nice.

M at Miranova,194,4,3,7/18/11,"M...hmm let's start with the good...i've been here several times, but finally decided to write a review after attending a going away party for a friend with 40or so of her colleagues and friends last week.It's a really cool spot.  Transports you from downtown Columbus to maybe downtown Miami.  Cool decor and the patio is really nice and chill.  Black orchid is a really great drink and so super pretty with the orchid incased in ice.  The shrimp cocktail was amazing!  Biggest shrimp i've ever seen/had.They have a small cocktail list and pretty much all of them are so sweet you need about a gallon of water after each one to not go into shock.  At $14 or so a piece, they could lay off the sugar and add some more booze.Service was super slow.  For a private party they knew about ahead of time and dropped a serious amount on the tab, the six or so servers for the party could have taken less than 10-15 minutes per their return on refills.  Also after being told several times by the host of the party to refill and replenish all the food, the cheese stood without crackers after about 7:45.  So the delicious food was really never eaten because the request for plates went unanswered.I'm writing this review mainly from the standpoint of large parties or gatherings.  I plan several of these a month for work, so just knowing that my guests won't have the chance to try anything because plates run out is a big turn off.",Renschke C.,,,,,,

I had the 14 oz steak - it was extremely delicious.  The ONLY minor ""negative"" about this restaurant - if you want to use the restroom - you have to go out in the main lobby of the building to use their restroom (this restaurant is located inside the 2 Miranova Professional Building).   Now, the restrooms were very nice, however I feel that if you are a top notch restaurant, you should ALWAYS have your own bathrooms.  ALWAYS.   Again, only a minor negative.Overall experience was very good - I would give this place 4.5 stars out of 5 overall.",Andrew R.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,5,5/29/08,"Before heading over here on foot, I checked with the front desk at the nearby Westin where I was staying to make sure that a) it was in fact within walking distance (yes) and that b) it was safe at night to walk there (yes.)M is located on the ground floor of a 2-building office park and high-end condo complex at the end of the street off of High Street.  It is super convenient to the Westin on High, and I was glad I didn't have to get back in the car and figure out parking someplace else.I was by myself, so the host was very accommodating and gave me a table in a section of the restaurant that no one else was seated in yet, and it remained empty throughout my meal. That was a bit odd, since I didn't even get in any good people watching, and it made me feel more alone.It didn't really matter though after reviewing the menu and settling in.  My server was Michelle, who was great and very attentive. I ordered the pan-fried halibut, served on a bed of 4 scrumptious lobster raviolis  covered in sweet corn emulsion.  I had started the meal with a spectacular Caesar salad.  The halibut was cooked perfectly -- with that lovely, crunchy, salty crust on it, giving way to succulent, meaty fish. Coupled with the sweetness of the corn sauce and the savory quality of the lobster inside, it made my toes curl.I finished it off with the decadent lava cake and homemade ice cream, which I never should have ordered since I felt like a beached whale already.  Topped off with 2 glasses of fantastic pinot noir, and I was a happy, overstuffed little Ohio traveler.It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time, and ranks up there not just among places I've traveled to, but among all overall restaurant experiences.Just wish I'd had someone to share it with.",Krys G.,,,,,,

The bathrooms were located around The corner outside the dining room and in the hall of the business it occupies making it somewhat hard to locate, but I was escorted very helpful. The food was very very good you can tell it came from a chef of high-caliber ! The portions looked small but as it turned out they were very satisfying! After enjoying some immaculate lava cake for dessert, we left M completely content and agreed it was the highlight of our night ! I didn't give five stars because it's somewhat hard to find at night being tucked away in a corner and the bathrooms were not in the same  area of the restaurant.",Jeff F.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,2007/2/8,"As fine as fine-dining gets in Columbus, M sets the bar high for their competition.  Perhaps the oddest part of the experience is actually walking into the place.  First of all, valet your car.  You are going to pay about the same price to park it in the secure garage yourself so toss the valet an extra few bucks and the keys.  It's much easier.You enter 2 Miranova Place into a big, cold office building lobby but this should be your last reminder of the daily grind for the rest of your time here.  Once through the tall glass door at the end of the lobby you enter the restaurant which has an elegantly modern decor.  Huge white transparent drapes 'separate' the dining room into a few smaller sections and there are a few more private table options in the form of  a private dining room or the 'barrel' table near the hostess area with tall wooden panels surrounding the table.The bar area features a few small tables and a larger tall under-lit faux-stone table.  The entire wall behind the bar lights up in various colors and continuously fades almost imperceptibly through the entire color spectrum.  Tiny LED lights at the top of the huge white curtains in the dining room match whatever color the bar wall is at that particular time.  At the very back of the dining room are four round booths that are easily the tables of choice if your party has three or four people.Both the food and the service at M almost never disappoint.  The menu changes more often than the staff here, which is always nice because if you had something in the past and it is no longer on the menu chances are good that your server knows what you are talking about and the chef knows how to make it.  And they have been known to make special trips (if possible) to the supermarket or another restaurant if you have requested something that is not in the house.Sure, the price point is a little higher than most restaurants but this IS the crown jewel of the Cameron Mitchell Empire.  Expect entrees to run from the high teens to high thirties and a drink could range from $3.50 (ie. Bud) to $140 (ie. Louis VIII), with just about everything in-between.  There are several places around Columbus where you can go and spend about this to get about this, but none are as sure-fire for a good experience as M.",Nathan L.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,2,7/15/11,"If the rating was based on the food alone, it would be 5 stars. However, the service was mediocre. But before I get to the bad, let's go over the good. The kobe slider burgers were great. Perfectly juicy on perfect mini buns with great tasting steak-cut fries. The Grape Crush drink I had was amazing. I never had a knack for grape, but apparently it was their most popular drink, so I went for it, and I was not disappointed. The Black Orchid drink was also good, with a slight lychee flavor, served over a ball of ice with an orchid flower in it. I loved the presentation. My filet was cooked to perfection, although I noticed both my steak and my boyfriend's prime steak had a charred taste on the outside. Their mac and cheese was so rich and creamy and cheesy, it was well worth the $11 price tag, Now, let's get to the bad. After we were seated, we waited ten minutes to be acknowledged. After we got our cocktail menus, we waited another 10 minutes to put our drink order and appetizer orders in. Our drinks came, but it wasn't our server who brought it over, so we couldnt put our food order in yet. Finally, after another 10 minutes, a manager came by and asked if we wanted more bread, so we took that chance to tell him we were ready to order. a MANAGER had to take our order. And at this point, it had been 30+ minutes since we've been seated before we could put our entree orders in. How absolutely sad. It took another 20 minutes for our food to get out, but it was well worth the wait. All in all, the experience was great. The decor was nice to look at, which was great since we had a lot of time to spare between waiting for our service and actually getting our food. I don't regret going, but I definitely don't want to go back. There are plenty of places in columbus with food just as good that won't cost us a $200 price tag for 2 people, and with service that is actually worth giving a tip. I'm pretty sure the valet boy deserved a better tip than our waitress.",Spongebob S.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,4,1/24/11,"I had a great time at M. The food was good. The drinks, service and atmosphere were great. But....When talking to the staff, they seemed stiff and rehearsed. Every encounter sounded scripted, whether we were being handed over to another staff member to be taken to our table, offered drinks, or presented with our food: ""And your dragon roll looks marvelous drizzled in our house blablabla sauce,"" the waiter tells us, clearly trying his hardest to deliver this line that he's delivered a hundred times before.If they had sounded sincere, it would have been fine, but they only sounded like they were trying to sound sincere. I'll give them an A for effort, but I prefer giving out A's for authenticity. Instead, my girlfriend and I cringed each time someone came to the table, waiting for the next awkward encounter to end. It would have been painful to endure if not for two ginger hibiscus cocktails, which turned out to be both delicious and practical.Please don't get me wrong; I don't need my waiter to ask how my day was or sit down at my booth like we're at Applebee's, but as much as I enjoyed my evening, I can't really rave about M the way I would have hoped to because no one let any personality shine through.",Brian B.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,4,6/28/10,"So I finally gave in to the hype and celebrated a special occasion at M. It was definitely an experience worth celebrating. With excellent service, even better food and a romantic and hip atmosphere, it was everything I could have asked for.While the prices are steep, it is worth it for a special night out. Definitely recommended!",Bradi F.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,12/17/07,"Been here several times since the restaurant opened.  Always had a 5-star experience.Hm, where to start.  Well the food is fantastic.  Everything I have ever had, from a lobster claw stew-type dish to a cut of beef has been perfect.  Wine list is second-to-none for Columbus.Service has been outstanding every time.  I've come here with dates, I've brought my mother here for her birthday, regardless of who I'm with (or how I'm dressed) I always feel like royalty.The bar / lounge area is perfect for hanging out before (or after) dinner.Bring cash for the valet.  No reason to pay for parking at Miranova.There are some new ""fancy"" restaurants opening in the area but for a fabulous, consistent dining experience, M is it.",Christopher S.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,4,3/18/12,This restaurant always gets a visit when I visit Columbus.  Great place to eat at the bar when Cris is working who is probably the best mixologist Ive come across.  She is always trying new concoctions but definitely try the black orchid or orange pomelo martini.  Their sushi is limited but delicious and on Friday is half-off.  The soups are bland but the truffle fries are out of this world.,Robert Z.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,5,10/18/08,"M wins my vote for best patio in the city. This luscious and decadent outdoor area will make you feel transported to an Arabian Night.M is my favorite place to go for late night cocktails. Even during the weekend it is not too busy and you can feel like you have the place to yourself. While I love the bar with its phallic sculptures and theatre lighting, if its summer you know I am outside.To get to the patio you have to exit the main restaurant. Opening the heavy door, entering the patio is entering a different world. Back lit by some of the best skyline views of the city its a great place to relax and talk. The seating is cushions and plush long couches. There are heat lamps to eliminate the chill of a summer evening. The patio is underneath a terrace hung with plants and lighting, but not enough for it to be overly bright. Sitting out here reminds of me of paintings of Roman courtesans lounging about and eating fruit. While I would not recommend stretching that far out, I would recommend putting your feet up on an ottoman and a glass of champagne.The patio at M is a great way to enjoy one of the cities best restaurants on a budget. Just having a few drinks is enough atmosphere and service to recreate a full dining experience with out breaking the bank.",Marissa M.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,2,2/24/10,"The food was all decent but if you're looking for EXCELLENT food, which is what i was expecting for the price($35 just for the steak, no sides), go elsewhere. I had the dry-aged Kansas City Strip, there was nothing wrong with it but it didn't impress me. If you're looking for a great steak check out J. Gilberts on the north side or The Clarmont on the south side, both of which are in the same price range. For all around better food, not just steak, check out G. Michael's Bistro. Cameron Mitchell restaurants are always highly touted but always seem to let me down. Again there is nothing really wrong with them but there are just much better restaurants all over Columbus.",Adam B.,,,,,,

M at Miranova,194,4,5,2006/3/10,"Most undoubtedly I had my best meal in Columbus at M. Food, service, atmosphere were all top notch. I had halibut with lobster raviolis in a sweet corn emulsion, and thought I died and went to heaven. The fish was so flaky I almost couldn't pick it up. As for the lobster periogies, it might be difficult to ever find something so delicious. The waitress was the nicest girl ever, so friendly, she like me and the girl I took so much that she rang up our desert as our anniversary and we got it for free. We got the doughnuts and the banana bread pudding and both were above and beyond good. I really couldnt think of a complaint if I tried. If was pretty pricey, but I have absolutely no problem spending money on a meal that good. Worth every penny.",andrew s.,,,,,,
M at Miranova,194,4,5,2009/12/7,"Just came back from the ""M"". LOVED IT! Beautiful place with friendly and intelligent service (meaning they check on you at the right time without being in your face every five minutes). The food was wonderful. Our orders (for four) ranged between chicken, veal, seafood (bass), and a vegetarian dish which they cooked as a special order. That was actually an interesting experience because there were no vegetarian entrees on the menu. Yet when my mom-in-law asked for a vegetarian suggestion, our waitress happily responded ""we can make whatever you'd like"". And they did, literally.  Everyone was very happy with their choices. We had a chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream for dessert and it was delicious. Last but not least - the ambiance and the energy at the ""M"" are beautiful. You can choose to sit inside or outside (try that on a nice night, it's worth it!). They play nice music arrangements and the color display behind the bar changes every few minutes, projecting beautiful soft colors throughout the entire room. We will definitely be back.",Lana G.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,12/14/17,"Marcella's vegetarian options were simple, but great. I just had three things: the cauliflower, garlic bread, and the penne arrabbiata. The cauliflower was grilled in some evoo (extra virgin olive oil) and packed with flavor. The garlic bread wasn't on the menu, but they rubbed some garlic and olive oil on the bread they usually serve. Thanks! The penne arrabbiata was the rockstar. The only time I've had arrabbiata (basically spicy tomato sauce) this good was in Rome and took me back to my study abroad trip junior year of college - I immediately texted some old friends who were with me in Rome to check in and say hello!  Come by if you're like me and stay at the Le Meridien on the regular - especially if it's snowing so hard walking farther than a block is a struggle. Side note: If they could add another vegetable based entree and put little v's on their menu to designate the vegetarian options that would be great!",Nishad J.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2001/9/18,"I've always heard people refer to 'Cameron Mitchell Service'. ""It's what he's known for!"", they say. After dining at Marcella's, I finally know what they're talking about.Marcella's can certainly feel 'themed' or contrived at times, but an undeniable undercurrent of quality permeates throughout the operation. House cured meats, fresh salads and cheeses, great pastas and seafood dishes, a surprisingly rare and diverse wine selection... and that's all before you consider the 'Cameron Mitchell Service', which is perhaps the star of the show. The night my wife and I dined at Marcella's was packed beyond belief. Despite arriving at 5:20 for a 6:00 PM reservation, we still had to wait until 6:10 to get a table. Marcella's is undeniably a 'turn-and-burn' restaurant, meaning, be prepared to feel pressure to order, eat and get out (which is fine at these prices).I had the linguine with clams EVOO and no pancetta. Pancetta is typically used to saltify a dish, which I find redundant when dealing with clams and a heaping portion of fresh Parmesan cheese. And while the menu says EVOO, I suspect there was a good amount of butter in there too. Nevertheless, the clams were fresh, the pasta - al dente, and was the best linguini with clams that I've had in Columbus. I will definitely be returning for it. The Cesar salad was also fresh and crisp, with a tangy sauce and fresh, salty sardine (optional). Try it with some fresh cracked pepper.    But let's get back to the service. From the amazing bartender -- who was friendly, professional, and attentive and who brought waters without having to ask -- to the front desk staff who never lost their cool despite the angry mob, and who got us a table away from the chaos up front, to our friendly and knowledgeable server, everyone in Marcella's works at high level. When you walk through the restaurant, every employee gets out of your way, even when you insist that they go first. It's a subtle but telling characteristic of great management, and makes for an overall exciting dining experience. Marcella's is my new local 'go to' for traditional Italian food.",Malcolm K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2012/2/17,"A friend picked this place for his birthday dinner, for a group of 20. The dim lighting totally screams Sopranos. Our server gal did a good job, friendly and efficient. All orders were taken in a timely fashion, and checks were correct. I started with the Beet Salad. The dressing was borderline too tart/pucker. However, the candied nuts and goat cheese dollops were a great paring. Just wish there was more. A great amount of arugula, but more of the sweet would have better counterbalanced the lemon dressing.Split a Pepperoni Pizza, added mushrooms and green peppers to my half. Tasty toppings and cheese, as well as the perfectly crisp-edge, soft-center crust. The pizza's not ginormous, but could easily feed two people with an appetizer. Was it worth $15? Very solid taste, but perhaps there's equal or better out there.",Gwen W.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2010/2/17,"Woo! I love Marcella's! It's seems like a super fancy place, but it's great for happy hour right after work or right after class. It's also a wonderful place to get drinks with your best gal pals.I came with a group of 12, which is really not feasible for this place and I probably wouldn't go with that many again. We came right at 5, so it wasn't even packed. There were tons of tables and just a handful of people here and there.Everything was half of because we came during happy hour, so I got a grapefruit basil fizz, recommended by our wonderful, sweet, pink-haired waitress. Oh, so good!I also did shareables! We ordered a few pizzas, prosciutto with melon, a huge, softball-sized veal meatball, calamari, risotto balls, and sausage. Everything was so good! The decor was perfect. Dim lights with those weird mirrors that have dust or gray stuff on it to make them seem old, powdered soap in the bathroom, and meat hanging out towards the back of the room.",Saphace A.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,8/15/17,"A great Columbus recommendation. Perfect for groups and a lively nice casual atmosphere is what will greet you at Marcella's. The short north area is nice too, with plenty of more pricey steakhouses next door but if you're in the mood for some hearty Italian tapas- this is your spot. Our service was great- our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and attended to our needs. We had the braised veal meatball (huge) and melted pecorino cheese to start. Both were excellent dishes enjoyed by our group of 5. We also ordered the crispy potato pizza to share, which was another crowd favorite. The cheese was tasty, and the thin texture was perfectly chewy. My coworker and I shared the salmon dish and a beer salad, and both were really tasty with good light flavors. To end our night, we tried the profiteroles, which were a good size to share. Nothing amazing for this dessert, but a nice sweet cap to the night. Overall, we enjoyed our time here and I'd recommend for a nice group outing!",Clara S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,8/17/17,"Food was all around pretty good, would be 4 stars except for the service which needs to improve.  To start the hostess staff is generally indifferent/unfriendly.  Did not get a warm goodbye or a warm welcome.  That's bad, in my opinion.  But, they have plenty of business so doesn't really matter how they greet people I suppose.  People will still come here.  Next, from time we sat down, to time we got first drink, was 26 minutes. Not acceptable.  Food service was slow, but once food started to come, it was timely paced which was appreciated--courses came in order, and not until the previous course was finished.Had not been here in a while and forgot how loud it was.  May be the loudest restaurant in columbus, which is partly a result of the music that blasts overhead.  Not really into this.Had salads to start--chopped salad was absolutely fantastic--the caprese salad looked underwhelming, which was sad considering it's the climax of tomato season.Burrata appetizer was pretty good, but appeared to be half of a burrata and not a whole one.  Have had bigger, better, for cheaper in Boston and NYC.  The tomato jam was nice, but would be nice if it didn't come spread on the the toasts, as they got soggy fast.Had the meatball pasta--one of their veal meatballs served over fettuccini alfredo...meatball was great, pasta was good, but overlooked.Companion had chicken piccata--was an airline breast that didn't really work well with the dish.  Smaller portion, but price was fair I suppose to make up for the portion size.Menu to me is a little boring and could use an update.  Started with a cocktail that was rye, cynar and cointreau...it was really nice.Like I said, food was generally good, but wait for drinks and the indifferent greeters took this down a star.  Also no one working the valet, despite having several meters blocked off our front.  Not good.",Jared E.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,11/16/17,"Great spot to go, great crowd and energy but the flatbread pizza was awful. Order something else!

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,10/21/17,"I can't believe I just went to this place for the first time ever. It's been on my wish list forever, but never came up when deciding on places. My husband and I met up with 4 others on a weeknight. The place was pretty busy which was expected. We had two servers helping us and both were great. They kept us in drinks all evening and were attentive. I ordered the chicken Marsala because I pretty much can't not order it when it's an option on the menu. It was amazing! It came atop polenta and the entire dish was delicious. It was a pretty hefty portion as well. The chicken was cooked perfectly. There were larges cloves of garlic mixed in. Great seasoning. Just delish. Everyone around the table ordered something different and they all looked good and were all pretty large. No one had any complaints to my knowledge. We were all full and happy and then something happened that has never happened before- every one of us ordered a dessert and no one ordered it to share! I was shocked as the server went around the table. All the dessert looked incredible and mine was rich and decadent and amazing. It was the chocolate almond cake. I tried the cherry almond tart thing too and it was also amazing. Overall the experience is great, service is good, food is amazing, ambiance is nice- it's earned its 5 stars.",Heather S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2001/6/18,This place is one of my favorites in Columbus! The chicken parm and meatball are great options that never disappoint. The upscale Italian feel is a good mix from the typical chain Italian restaurant. Already looking forward to going back!,Michael W.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,5/25/17,"Holy crap batman. I almost never talk about food as my taste buds are, how shall I say, nonintellectual..(is that a thing). But anywho I just had a dinner comprised 100% of appetizers and I have NO REGRETS. Started with the chopped salad (too small) followed by my main course of the Braised Veal Meatball (yes a baby cow) paired with the Parmesan Crusted Onion. Holy shit that was a great combination to mix. Here on a Thursday night and the place is hopping. Great, very attentive service and a semi very casual atmosphere. Hey guys...

I excused myself to go to the bathroom and pulled him aside to ask if he could split the checks to exclude the birthday girl, and if he could bring over a birthday dessert. He executed everything perfectly, and even took the dessert off our tab.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2/17/17,"Really a 4.5! Making a reservation was easy and the menu encompasses everything an Italian restaurant should have.My fave appetizers were the Parma prosciutto bruschetta and the grappa cured salmon. They were so good, we didn't get a pic! The caprese salad was yummy but nothing to call home about. Presentation could have been better. I needed to add salt.I had the Citrus Gappa Cosmo and would recommend it! It was made very well and was strong ;) My mom got Strawberry Balsamic Martini and was not wow'd. Interesting flavor.The entrees were solid. The spaghetti and veal meatballs, chicken parm, and eggplant ravioli were all tasty! I knocked the score down only because I didn't love the marinara sauce. I wish it was jazzed up a little bit more. I do love how the chicken parm is a thin chicken breast. I'll definitely be back!

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2012/5/16,"I stopped in after a coworker recommended places to try near the convention center. It's a very short walk from it and the restaurant is surrounded by several other cute restaurants and shops in the downtown area. I sat in the bar since I came in at an odd hour, just shortly after lunch but before happy hour. I ordered a wine I ended up really enjoying based on what  my friendly server recommended. They give you free bread, which I couldn't stop eating with a bit of olive oil. I ordered the melted pecorino, which was delicious but it ended up feeling a bit heavy since I ordered it just for myself. Definitely a good portion for 2 people. My favorite dish was the brocolini with chickpeas because they used some kind of lemon vinaigrette that I absolutely couldn't get enough of. The flavors just melded so well!The restaurant is very cute and I sat facing the street. It can be a bit loud, especially since it's an open concept in the bar area so you get all the outside noise. But that didn't take away from the cook ambiance. In fact, it added to it. Would love to come back to try more next time I return to Columbus.",Karen G.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2011/12/17,"Really a special place. I am very much looking forward to coming for another visit. Had the cheese plate appetizer, and while the cheese portions were a bit small, the presentation was good and the flavors were very strong. My wife had the cheese bread with marinara and felt the sauce was incredible - acidic with a little sweetness: fresh in other words. We tried to do a complex order of a half salad half pizza lunch in hopes to share the food between us and our waitress, without asking, split the Caesar salad in two plates for us - how great is that? Very good Caesar dressing. The tomato soup is bisque-like: very thick and salty with a good texture. We enjoyed a half mushroom pizza and we were impressed by the smoky flavor of the cheeses and the earthy mushrooms. Quite good!Finally we talked ourselves into a tiramisu dessert - which I will admit I am not a fan of. Until now. Dusty cocoa powder on top of moist custard layers with a caramel sauce and a coffee soaked cookie layer left us very satisfied. I am really looking forward to visiting again.",Joe R.,,,,,,

I know many people who appreciate their gluten free options as well. For me, I love their wine selection. The chicken parm and spaghetti with meatball are the best two menu items! You have to get the meatball when you go here! It is the most tender, perfectly cooked meatball you will ever eat in your life! This is also a great place to take out-of-towners.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,6/22/17,"Why change a great restaurant? I'm not sure but on a recent visit to my beloved Marcella's I was very disappointed. And it is only partially due to the waitress basically not attending our table.The drinks have taken a nosedive. Not only did they take some of my absolute favorites off the menu, they have replaced them with not so great alternatives. The grapefruit basil drink, 2/5. The strawberry fizz 1/5. Also I haven't had the marinara spaghetti before but I didn't like it. The sauce was too tangy and did not work. The meatball thankfully was very good. Marcella's will continue to be a good spot for a happy hour meal involving their tasty appetizers. The ambiance is great and I love the rustic dim look. Without the delicious drinks they used to have its no longer the place I would recommend to get a few drinks after work.",Jane L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,2010/3/17,"I was really excited to try Marcella's, my boyfriend and I have attempted to go 4 times but due to long wait we ended up going elsewhere. Monday night, I called in to make a reservation to make sure we (well, just me) could finally try it for the first time. Fire whoever answers the phone or give them a Prozac. Hostesses are underwhelming. Our service was great. I called in to say that we would be ten minutes late, and we were seated immediately upon arrival. Understandably, good food has a reasonable wait. I want to say we were seated by 7:40, ordered by 8, and got our food around 40 minutes later. The food was disappointing. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parm. You could tell the food had been sitting for awhile because the pasta was dry and the chicken parm crust was soggy. He was so hungry he asked for a side of marinara for his dry pasta and ate the whole thing anyways. This is after (literally) 4-5 baskets of bread and a salad appetizer. I had the fettuccini with meatball. The meatball was disgustingly soggy. I let my boyfriend have a bite of my meatball because he had been to Marcella's twice before, and he agreed that it was soggy. I couldn't get a ""chunk"" of meatball on my fork, everything just fell apart to mush. It had the consistency of cat food. I was able to move it around on my plate and reshape it however I pleased. The pasta was good, but didn't live up to the ""large portions"" that I heard Marcella's was known for. We brought the quality of the food to the server's attention. She apologized and said she would let the chef know. She also said that the meatball was veal and is known to ""crumble"", but honestly no matter what the meat, there is no excuse for a giant meatball to break down into a creamy pÌ¢tÌ©-like consistency. We gave her our card and she returned less than 5 minutes later with the receipt, meaning that she didn't bring our concerns to the attention of any manager. We expected at least something to be comped or discounted (I would've been happy if she comped a beer), but I'm not one to really cause a scene seeing as I work in the service industry myself. Overall the bread was the best part. We will not be returning to Marcella's. +1 star for the service. I could pay less and get better food elsewhere. I would suggest Cooper's Hawk in Easton for a similar style menu with more options, much better quality, and customer service.",Stephanie D.,,,,,,

Right after my server Jared came over and explained their menu and specials to me after learning it was my first time there. I decided on the Melted Pecorino (which was half off as it was happy hour :)) and the spaghetti and meatball.First of all, the Melted Pecorino was amazing. It's simply melted Pecorino cheese,  granny smith apple slices, truffle honey, and crostini. I ate all if the ingredients of this appetizer together, separately, and every other way combined and it was all amazing. Get it. You won't regret it. My entree of spaghetti and meatball came and I was blown away. The meatball was the size of a softball! It was also so tender and juicy that I had to use very little pressure to break pieces of of off with my fork. The pasta sauce was just how I like it; tangy, super flavorful and full of spice, I couldn't have asked for more.And the service was impeccable.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2002/12/17,The melted pecorino is delicious. I normally always get the spaghetti and meatball but I've had the clams linguine before.

As I turn back I see a table being setup and assume that the table the hostess mentioned. I turn back and a couple comes in from outside and they take a party of two to the four topper that just got setup. At this point I'm pissed. I asked the hostess why this couple that just walked in from the street got a table now. ""We are still seating 7:15 reservations"".So let me get this, I've been here 25 mins waiting for a table and someone that 15 mins late get their table?

I'm happy to report that Marcella's did not disappoint.  Admittedly, I did stay away from ordering pasta or pizza (I'm most judge-y about those two) and stuck with apps. I had the melted pecorino and prosciutto & melon. The cheese dish was delicious! Warm and melty, served with bread, apples and truffle honey -- it was a great sweet and savory combo! The prosciutto and melon, while admittedly hard to screw up, was also yummy... A nice, light treat on a hot summer day. The real delight came at desert though, when I noticed they had afogato on their after dinner drinks menu! One of my favorite treats in Italy, this is a scoop of gelato smothered with espresso. The perfect combination of sweet dessert and after-dinner pick me up shot of caffeine.Service was attentive and quick. I appreciated the care they took of our large group of 10 teenagers and 5 adults. It would have been easy for them to tack on an 18% gratuity and phone it in all night. They did neither!",Taryn R.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,6/17/16,"To find a place to eat, I checked out YELP and it lead me here.  With my boss beside me we sat down and discussed our options. Both of us have the same habit of ordering one specific dish to find out if it's good food... From the moment we entered, listening to the 80's tunes playing on the over head, to the wines lining the walls and being seated next to a bottle of Luna di Luna (my nick name is Luna) we knew we were going to enjoy this place.. and we did.  The service was amazing, and the food.. YES!!! So good.  From the aparatif of a Lemoncello drink to the caprese salad we split.  To our entrees, both of us gave this restaurant thumbs up.",Dianna B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,1/15/17,"Celebrated a birthday here! I've been wanted to try this place for so long and finally made it happen! Food-wise, we had calamari and veal meatball as appetizers, crispy potatoes and shrimp pesto pizza as main dishes. They were all very delicious!!! My favorites were the calamari and the crispy potatoes pizza! I like how the fried calamari was prepared! It is true that it is fried food; however, the way how they fried it didn't make me feel as unhealthy as I normally would feel. Crispy potatoes was surely a hit! It was a bit salty but I really enjoyed it! Restaurant was pretty packed and a little loud. The only minor complaint is that the seats are overly close to each other, which made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Service was okay - I can tell that they were busy so kind of slow at times. I would still gladly return because of the food!",Mirabelle L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2011/12/17,"I started with a 3 meat selection...something to gnaw on while I was waiting for my group. All 3 were wonderful. For dinner, I had the Penn Alla Arrabiatta. It's spicy and delicious. Overall the meal was great. My only nit pick (and it's more this location) is that it is a bit noisy, which make casual conversation more of a shouting match. But overall, a great place to eat.",Mark E.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2/14/17,"Disappointing. We have been here a couple of times and have come away came here for dinner now in the last few months and the food really hasn't gone our way. Let me say that the service has always been fine. However, during our most recent visit, the calamari was really terrible. Super fried and pretty tasteless. The kicker was that this was recommended by our server when we were debating between a few appetizers :). The main course was better. The  gnocchi came in a red sauce and it wasn't bad. In the past we've tried the cheese board and the charcuterie and they've been okay. Given the reviews, we've been somewhat underwhelmed.",Ness S.,,,,,,

U was starving so I walked over to marcellas and I'm so glad I did because the spaghetti was sooooooo good.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,7/15/17,"It was a Thursday night, it was raining and had been raining all day. People were standing in the rain waiting to get in.  The place was standing room only, obviously. I was by myself.. Snuck in the bar area, lots of OSU students and businessmen. I had the linguine w/bianca clam sauce with the veal meatball as an app and I really do not know what to say.  The entree had some onions and pancetta which is not the way it is normally made, plus, there wasn't a lot of clam sauce. I never tasted anything like it.  I am used to the standard garlic/oil/butter/wine clam sauce, this was just different, in a great way.  The veal meatball was so good, I ordered another one to go. Stacy at the bar was on top of everything.Highly recommend..",Louis D.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,5/14/17,"Had the pleasure to spend Mother's Day with my partner....decided on lunch at Marcella's...This is my 2nd trip to Marcella's, 1st review...Let's start by saying it's on High St. closer to W. Goodale Ave in the Short North...Parking can be difficult, volume of traffic was amped up today, lots filled up quickly...Lucky enough to snatch a table in the faux patio area...(doors open and table faces street - perfect for people watching)...Started off the luncheon with a couple drinks...I had some type of Lemon Drink with Vodka, Limoncello, Lemon Juice, Lemon Zest...if you like lemon highly recommend this drink...tasted wonderful and definite zip in there provided by the vodka : )My partner had some type of Strawberry Cocktail which looked and tasted wonderful, maybe be a bit Fufu for you guys but it was delicious. After drinks came up we ordered the Calimari, another strong recommendation on this dish...Lightly breaded, dish comes with deep fried lemons, a thin slices of zucchini( taste like zucchini potato chips)...the dish was accompanied by Aioli dipping sauces and Marcella's homemade sauce - both are winners....I ordered the Chicken Parmesan, large piece of Chicken lightly breaded thin and covered in cheese and sauce...dish came with a side of pasta...If you like Chicken Parm, you won't be disappointed ordering this dish....My partner ordered the ravioli's which had a light goat cheese filling, with a hint of garlic....She said the dish was wonderful...We  enjoyed our lunch so much and didn't want to leave so we decided on dessert...many quality choices but decided on chocolate almond cake with chocolate ganache...again another winner, think chocolate amaretto cake with a thick chocolate sauce...delicious....Our server Karen was awesome, very helpful and filled our drink glasses several times during our lunch...If you haven't been to Marcella's treat yourself to a wonderful dining experience...the happy hours are some of the best in the city and the Italian Cuisine will put a smile on your face : ))",Chris C.,,,,,,

I had the meatball and fettuccini to my absolute delight. I rarely ""win dinner,"" but we all shared our plates and mine came out on top - the lasagna was second and the gnocchi came in third.

All the way from the atmosphere to the what's being served. Environment:5/5I love the old Italian feel and the imperfection this place has to offer. It's dim lit and a very romantic atmosphere. It's awesome that they have an open kitchen because it feels more like ""family dining"" that way.Service:4/5People are always on top of their game here. A few times I've had servers who were very dismissive of my table, but everything else makes it easy to ignore. Prices:4/5I think the prices are just right. Yeah, it's pricey - but you are paying for a different kind of Italian cuisine experience you can't quite get anywhere else. Although their portions are on the smaller side for the prices. But, No ""bone app the teeth"" here! LOLFood:5/5Everything I have tried here amazes me! I recommend the Pecorino melted plate they have here! It's toasted bread, apple slices, cheese, and delicious truffle honey that makes for an odd combination, but tastes amazing.

Very gross. I had been excited for the breaded chicken fettuccine Alfredo that I ordered but ended up with a meal I had to throw away and feeling sick to my stomache. They need to check the food before its served to customers!",Kait L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,9/22/17,"I ate here for dinner while I was attending a trade show at the convention center.  If I lived nearby I'd probably eat here once a week.  Everything on the menu looked delicious. I ended up getting the meatball and fettuccine.  Omg!!  It was so good, I'm still thinking about it.  The meatball (which is huge), was tender and perfectly cooked. The marinara sauce was wonderfully seasoned - certainly seemed home made and not canned.  The alfresco sauce in the fettucinecwas just right - light and flavorful and even the linguine was cooked perfectly (I wonder if they make their own pasta?  It seemed like they do).  It's moderately priced and the service was excellent. My only complaint is that it was a touch noisy but the place was packed (even though I got seated right away), which you'd expect for a place this good.",Sarah R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,6/30/16,"Most days I don't believe in Italian food because I have this philosophy that most Italian restaurants aren't any better than something I could make at home by myself. I have been to Marcella's on several different occasions and have always had a good time and I think Marcella's is an exception to my usual philosophy.The bread isn't very good to me in comparison with other restaurant's free breads, but no worries because there are better things to come. We always like ordering the calamari - it's tasty and a decent size to share. I've also tried the chicken parm, linguine and clams, and spaghetti. The big meatball is just fun because yeah sometimes I just wanna eat one large meatball so wut. I think portions are fair on the most part - especially with the three entrees I've tried (but the ravioli looked a little small to me). I've also tried the cannoli and tiramisu I would recommend both! They have a variety of coffee/espresso drinks (both alcoholic and non) for your post-dinner pleasure. I've had the affogato (a shot of espresso and vanilla gelato) which I think was a bit small for the $, but omg I'm about to have that every morning instead of my normal coffee. Nothing is earth shattering good but the ambiance is good, everything is quite tasty, service is good, and it's a good spot for a dinner that's whatever you want to make it (on a scale of casual to classy). Marcella's to me is consistent, and is a safe place to bring friends, family and visitors because I think everyone can find something to like that will be delicious! Sundays are 25% off bottles of wine. Hopefully I can make it to a Happy Hour soon for the dealz 4-6PM on weekdays.",Rosalie W.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2/27/17,Overpriced because of location though. Came here for a date. Was treated very poorly by the staff probably because of my age I'm assuming.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,8/22/16,"I had a delightful dinner at Marcella's last Thursday evening. This was my first time visiting the Marcella's in Short North. I had previously eaten at the Marcella's in Polaris, but I did not have a positive experience. During my visit at the Marcella's in Polaris, I ordered spaghetti and it was very bland. This time, I ordered the spaghetti and meatball. The meatball was the largest meatball I had ever seen! Marcella's gives you a lot of food for your money. The portions are HUGE! The meatball and spaghetti sauce were homemade and loaded with lots of flavor. The restaurant also gives you bread to go with your meal and olive oil. The bread could use some work. It is a little hard. Besides the delicious food, the ambience is pleasant. The restaurant is small and can get loud, but the dim lighting and candles make up for the noise. Overall, Marcella's is a great casual restaurant with authentic Italian food.",Emily F.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,8/17/16,"I ate dinner at Marcella's last night and forgot how fancy it is. Like, they serve you bread before the meal and there are table clothes. And yet, the portion sizes are so small.  Last night, it was a typical busy evening so we had to wait fifteen minutes so we grabbed a drink at the bar. I ordered a Rhinegeist beer (I think it was Cougar) and thought it was an easy to drink beer.I learned that when you order a drink at the bar before your meal, you are supposed to close out your tab there. For some reason I thought I could take the receipt with me to the table and pay the waitress for our bar tab. Nah, doesn't work that way.We sat at a granite tabletop next to the window facing High St. so it was fun to watch all the people pass by. There was a yoga class going on at the Joseph hotel so that was unique to watch a yoga class while eating dinner.I ordered the Tortellini Alla Manzo and thought the beef, mushrooms and tortellini was delicious but I wish there was more of it. For what I paid, I expected an Olive Garden-esque portion and enough that I could take some home for lunch the next day. There were maybe six tortellini pieces in total.My boyfriend ordered the Linguine and Clams. The pasta had a really nice flavor. This was my first time trying clams and I would definitely order them again.I still like Marcella's but I wish the portions were larger.",Debbie G.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,8/27/17,"Came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend. We made a 6 o clock reservation and arrived maybe 15 minutes early. We were seated immediately and loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. There was dim lighting and it was full of noise from everyone talking, but we loved it. I got the chopped salad with balsamic vinaigrette and my boyfriend got the Caesar as well as the bruschetta appetizer. Everything was amazing and we couldn't wait for our entrees. I ordered the penne alla arrabiatta with a veal meatball (I heard they were amazing), and my boyfriend got the gnocchi with lamb and a meatball. It was honestly some of the best Italian food I have ever had, and believe me, I eat a lot of Italian food. The meatball was so moist and tender that it literally melted in my mouth. The pasta was spicy and perfectly al dente. I've already made reservations to come back and carboload the night before we run the Columbus Half Marathon. I 100% recommend Marcella's.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,4/21/16,"We've been to Marcella's at Polaris and most recently on Tuesday PM in the Short North.  The Short North was a disappointment. The food, drink and ambiance are all wonderful. Three pasta dishes and one chicken.  Wine, beer and cocktails were perfect. Even on a Tuesday night for dinner with friends the place was busy which gave it a great vibe almost as if it were the weekend.  Where this location disappointed was the server.  It must have not been a good night for her.  Our experience of her wasn't warm rather robotic.  When there was an error on a salad she brought out to the table and as it was called to her attention (and it was provided politely) she argued with us repeating what she heard vs. what was truly ordered. At the end of the meal she didn't ask any of us if we wanted coffee, dessert or another round of drinks.  Our experience was she couldn't be bothered and was anxious for us to move on.  Upon sharing our thoughts with corporate we received a canned response.  Not the best dining experience which is sad considering this is a Cameron Mitchell establishment and that was surprising and unfortunate.  We're open to trying other fine dining establishments and are open to suggestions.  We'd much rather write winning reviews were we can share about positive experiences.",Laura H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,12/29/16,"Made a reservation and that was a good idea, it was packed on a Monday night. Arenchini was very good as well as the house bread and oil. Ordered the chicken parmesean and meatball with fettuccine. Both were good but not the best I've ever had.",Amy K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2011/3/16,"I had a wonderful dinner at Marcella's this past weekend with my rowing team. We were in the area for a competition and had heard good things about this restaurant, so the race coordinator got twelve of us a reservation. Marcella's is in a popular part of town and it was an Ohio State football game day, so we were lucky to be seated at all and didn't mind a few separate tables. The staff were accommodating about some members of the party arriving later as well, which was appreciated. The atmosphere inside is dark wood with Italian accents (maps, loaves of bread in baskets, etc) and the effect is very charming. The ladies room had mouthwash with little disposable plastic shot glasses for rinsing next to the sink, which was nice touch. I can't help but wish more places did that!I'm unable to eat dairy, so I was confined to ordering some of their delicious cured meats and eating that with the bread and olive oil at the table, but this was plenty. The beer list was small but high-quality and very reasonably priced, with craft drafts for $5 and bottles for $4. Definitely a better deal than one typically sees in Pittsburgh. Overall I was very favorably impressed with Marcella's and will make a point to come back if I'm ever in Columbus again.",Madeline V.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2012/8/16,"I still really enjoy the food and the ambience, but the service continues to slip. Went there a couple of weeks ago, and the server we had not seemed disinterested to the point of being annoyed by us. Each time I asked her a question about the menu, before she finished addressing me she would look  toward another person in my group to the point where I could not hear her. I'm not sure if she thought the older members of my party were more worthy of her time. Whatever it was, it was weird It was weird and unsettling. Servers at Red Lobster do a better job, its a pity because I really enjoy the food.",Emma O.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2004/7/16,"I'm not a huge happy hour person because most happy hours are centered around alcohol and that's just not my thing. Some restaurants include limited small bites on their hh menu and then there's Marcella's with their crazy amazing hh menu. Not only does hh include specialty cocktails, but they also include glasses of wine over $9! Now, I don't drink that much, but when I do, I'm all about craft cocktails and good wine and when they're 1/2 off?! Who's with me?They have so many selections of food to choose from and while I wanted a pizza, I opted instead for the melted pecorino cheese and fennel salad with pan seared salmon medium rare....OMG!

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2007/5/17,Absolutely love this spot! Particular diners from LA. Great attention to detail as displayed in the ribbed water glasses and rock wine glasses.

Service was a bit inexperienced but capable and willing. Great overall experience that contributed to a fun start to our evening.,Sherry A.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,8/30/17,"This place is pretty overrated in my opinion. Multiple people have told me it is a must try in the short north, but all in all it was very average.  My girlfriend and I try the calamari at every restaurant we visit and this place currently ranks last out of 15+ restaurants in the Columbus area.  Their Tuscan limonata tastes like floor cleaner, even Diane Amos would be proud.  And the gnocchi con bolognese wasn't very good. Martini right down the street is much better (owned by the same people). Despite the average dinner, our service was very good. Our waitress was visibly very busy juggling other tables, but was able to check in periodically to make sure we had all that we needed.",Ben H.,,,,,,

We were in and out in just over an hour.The caprese was standard, nothing special. Its presentation wasn't the best, came out like a deconstructed dish on a very small plate. Not sure if that's how it's served here or if the busy crowd meant fewer large plates were available?The chicken piccata was good though not typical since it wasn't flattened, breaded boneless chicken breast. I had 2 pieces, one with a portion of a bone sticking out. Different but the aroma and flavor were great. A little on the dry side but the crust was good enough to make up for it.One thing that was frustrating is despite having had a reservation and arriving on time, we were still given a pager and made to wait before being seated.",Sarah K.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,1,8/16/17,"So I live across the street from marcellas. I come in here regularly and never have I had bad service. EXCEPT it takes ONE time to ruin my favorite place across the street from where I live. We came in on a quiet night and sat at the bar, where we were promptly greeted and had waters which was great. Our server who was a bartender asked us what we wanted to drink and everything was prompt. The issue is - she never offered us another drink, she never checked on us, and we had to get her attention to order anything we wanted. Every time I've come in, I've been offered dessert or another drink or anything else. This girl handed me my check at the end of my meal AS I WAS STILL FREAKING EATING (handed me my check as I was eating like what the heck???) and a box. I have never boxed my own food at this place and always have gotten dessert. But nope. Not this time.  This girl was extremely rude. Way to ruin my marcellas outlook. Cudos to you ma'am. But Ty and Anthony are probably the best servers there so they have that going for them.",Kate J.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,11/17/16,"We were running late and called to push our reservation - no problem they said. Upon our late arrival we only waited minutes for the table to be set. We started with 3 antipasti,  calamari, mushrooms, and rock shrimp. Yum yum! The calamari was so tender, almost ordered seconds. But we controlled ourselves for some scrumptious lasagna, chicken parmigiano and a sicilian pizza. This was our first time and we were very happy with everything. The service was good considering the packed house and folks waiting to get in. There were some delays but nothing to get worked up over. My daughter was taking us out for her mother's birthday and spotted their special offer of a $25 gift card with the purchase of a $100 gift card, so she's coming back with her friends next year. A double gift for mom and herself.Great food, noisy ambiance but we would be back on our next trip to Columbus.",Dave H.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,12/19/15,"Jumped in here on a Sunday whim whilst passing through the Short North. The nice dimly lit ambiance got me. Pizza also sounded good. Fancy pizza. Yes please. So that's what I got! I'll cut to it- it was fantastic. Best fancy pizza around. I wanted a beer...maybe a fancy one ... To go with my pizza. They had some, but very limited. All the usual kitschy ones you'd find anywhere. I guess it makes sense being quite an Italian place; the wine list was huge. I ate my delicious fancy pizza at a nice corner table by the window and all the while the service was great!

They gave the kids a bag of various noodles and tied it up with string.  When we got to the table, they knew just what to do.  They made pasta necklaces.  It kept them busy until the food got to us.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,9/20/17,"What eating connoisseur would avoid this fine dining experience? Sheik, elegant, delicious, are just a few words that come to mind when I think of this local Italian eatery. The first time I sampled their cuisine I was taken aback, I thought, this a fluke, I picked the one thing they do best, but to my pleasurable suprise, they do everything great. If you have not tried this real Italian dining experience your mouth has been cheated out of a religious taste experience. I highly recommend this establishment to anyone who loves to enjoy a wonderful atmosphere, great service and a meal that would make you tell every secret you know. Happy dining.",Angelo B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2/26/16,Great authentic Italian. Went during happy hour all the food was great the drinks were great and the bill was great. Waitress was also great,Rachel S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2012/2/15,"This may be one of the best happy hours in the city! From 4-6 PM, you can have half off of most of their menu -- pretty much all of the food except the signature dishes and main entrees. So, you can get half price pizza, half price salads, half price appetizers and small plates, half price COCKTAILS and half price on any wine that is $9 a glass or less! This means that I had a pizza, a salad, and two glasses of wine for $20. WHAT?!?! I also sampled some of the calamari and the arancini appetizers, and they are both delicious.I do think that some of the items I ordered would have been a tad overpriced if they hadn't been part of happy hour. For example, while the pizza was pretty tasty, it would be overpriced at $14. If I had only ordered the pizza, I could have eaten it all by myself. I think $10 would have been a more fair price. Anyway, it was still really good and a steal at $6.50! My beet and goat cheese salad was so good; a nice balance of flavors and the dressing wasn't too overpowering. This place has a clean, swanky atmosphere, and the price point of the regular food is still low enough to enjoy a nice night out. The service was friendly and accurate, and the bathrooms are super nice. Your best bet is the happy hour, but it's a great place for dinner if you have people in town or want to celebrate a special occasion.",Jillian M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,2005/4/17,"Disappointed everytime I go! This place is pretty, servers are wonderful but food is NOT good at all. I have been here 4 times hoping for better quality food but highly disappointed every time. For a Cameron Michel restaurant, Much more is expected. The tiramisu also isn't very italian for an italian restaurant. I think whole foods has 20x better and more authentic tiramisu than this place.",Gazal N.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2001/1/16,"Assuredly a top 3 restaurant in Columbus. They nailed it: food is delicious, decor is warm and inviting, service is attentive and knowledgable. Started with the melted pecorino which was nutty & buttery. Delicious with honey and apples provided. My truffle mushroom pizza was great. More than enough to feel satisfied. Only drawback was the noticeable amount of grease permeating through the crust. Boyfriend's lamb gnocchi was EXCEPTIONAL. I was food jealous.",Courtney D.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,9/24/16,"I came here and to be honest I was like this okay for columbus. Its a step above an olive garden.  Then I found out it was a Cameron Mitchell  restaurant (which I should give him 1 star as a result). I have eaten at Ocean Prime in Denver and Martini's a few blocks away so I know he can do way way better. For someone that knows food his choices were abominable. I admit I only had two appetizers and a grapefruit spritzer and sampled their sangria.I will go in order step by step.1) Sangria.  I always tell people you can tell how good a place is by trying their sangria.  I would drink a wine cooler any day then drink what was put in front of me.  Apparently they put soda water and ginger ale. Really.  Okay I am going to say again really?  Sangria is not hard.  Let me give you a simple recipe  I found 30 second on-line the kind I grew up with that my mom made that she adapted from her travels in Spain.http://minimalistbaker.com/easy-traditional-red-sangria/2. Eggplant rottini -  This was good.  I can see how it can be messed up being oily, smoothered in cheese, or tomato sauce.  They however messed up because it was served warm to room temperature and their was a weird after taste which I think was the tap water they were using instead of filtered water with the breadcrumbs.3.  bruschetta with ricotta.  With this, the bread was a little thick, the bread also had a weird after taste, I think it was the water again but my biggest complaint is the tomato sauce totally adulterated the dish.  Classic example of where a chef does way way too much.  The best ricotta dish is by far the most simple.  Please please go to another restaurant Michael Smith's extra virgin in Kansas City and get their home made ricotta and bread.  It is better than sex. It's that amazing. Yet I never tasted the ricotta at this restaurant. All I tasted was tomato sauce, a lot of salt (from the porcuitto), and the after taste of the bread but no ricotta.  If you are fixated on the tomato maybe a fresh slice of tomato but no tomato sauce mess.  Please do check out extra virgin  in Kansas City you will know instantly what I mean. Pure heaven.4. Grapefruit Spitzer -  Good but not great had better at the Le Meridien bar across the street.I forgot to mention my server was excellent.",Christopher T.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2002/10/16,"This was amazing! It is a great spot for a romantic evening or with a small group of friends. It is more of an intimate setting with a dimly light environment/candles on the tables. I tried a Manhatten from their cocktail list. It was the perfect amount of bourbon and sweetness that made it very enjoyable to sip on as a pre dinner drink. The Melted Pecorino was delicious. I layered the bread with some of the thin apple slices with cheese and topped it with honey. It was a light appetizer that is great for sharing.For dinner I ordered the tortellini. I felt that it was heavily saturated in sauce. However, I thought it had a lot of flavor. Next time I go, I want to try their Chicken Parm. Our waitress said it was one of her favorites!I thought the prices were reasonable for the type of restaurant and location in the Short North.",Maria P.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2010/2/16,"We went here on a Friday night and the place was hopping with students and family.  The service was efficient and he made good recommendations..  if you are gluten free this is the place for you.  They served gluten free bread which was served warm.  My family told me that this bread tasted better than the regular bread served for the table.  The flatbread pizza were large and very good.  The gluten free chicken Parmesan is a must.  The sangria was very good and served with a lot of fruit.  The noise level does get very noisy but the ambiance is wonderful.",Peter C.,,,,,,

I had heard of the huge meatballs and they are correct!  The meatball is humongous and I can't wait to try it the next time I go.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,1,2005/6/17,"No. Absolutely not. This place was such a let down in every conceivable way. We waited 2 hours for our table after being told we would have a 45 minute wait. Once we sat down we got over it and got excited for some nice Italian food. The menu was very basic as far as Italian goes, with nothing extraordinarily different from other Italian restaurants. I got spaghetti as I heard good things about it, and my girlfriend got the chicken parmesan. Our table was incredibly small and right near their drink station so we were constantly being run into and asked to scoot in so the employees could get through. After an hour of being pushed and shoved we finally got our food and were once again optimistic. Despite the long waits and horrible table location, we really were excited for the food, but it let us down. The pasta was dry and under cooked, while the chicken was over cooked in the chicken parm. Our waiter never once apologized for the bad food or table, and I guess he doesn't have to but it would have made things a little better. Horrible service, horrible food, completely overrated.",Jeffrey J.,,,,,,

I watched her with her other customers, and she was the same with them. The appetizers we ordered were plentiful and delicious, the wine was excellent, and the food was superb. I had to send my lasagna bolognese back because it was not as hot as if should be, and instead of just reheating my dinner, the chef prepared a new serving - and it was perfect. Desserts were wonderful and really big enough to be shared by 2. Even though the restaurant was very crowded and very loud, we were all very happy with Marcella's, and we will be back.",A D.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,3/13/17,"Amazing food and even better service. When seated at the table, the server brought a gluten free menu larger than most restaurants provide.

The staff was very knowledgeable and informative on gluten-containing ingredients and even offered letting me talk to the chef. They explained their chefs graduated from Columbus culinary institute, one of the best in the country, and is very educated in celiac and gluten free cuisine. They were able to confirm that all of the sauces, seasonings, and dressings used in all items on the gluten-free menu were safe. I ordered the penne and clams, which was out of this world and even had some crab. I was able to split my meal with a friend where they made her half with regular pasta.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,7/25/17,Outstanding food as great service!!!   The only reason I don't give it 5 stars was how incredibly loud the place is.  It may seem petty but it did diminish our experience here.  We made reservations which I STRONGLY recommend and had a good evening but did have a hard time having a conversation without feeling like we we were shouting.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2007/8/16,I like this place. Although the noise is a bit too loud for me I rated it as average because I was seated in the bar area.  In any case the food was good.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,2011/9/16,I'm very disappointed in Marcella's.  It's a great restaurant but their pick up process definitely needs work.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2006/2/16,"In the Short North, Cameron Mitchell has 2 Italian restaurants-- Marcella's and Martini. Of the two, Marcella's is much more casual and affordable. I also feel that Marcella's is closer to an actual Italian restaurant whereas Martini is more of a fancy Italo-American fusion. The food is great, the service is great, and the price is reasonable. On the flipside, it being the Short North, there's not a lot of space inside the restaurant. If you're seated at a booth, you'll have plenty of space. But if you're seated at a table, you'll feel like if you scoot your seat back too far, you'll hit someone else.

It had a wonderful sausage marinara sauce - just the right amount of spicy, and the pasta was perfectly cooked.  We decided to split a half bottle of Amarone della Valpolicella Classico which was also pleasing to the palate.  To finish off the night, I got the Tiramisu - I have to say, this is probably one of the best ones I've had (and I've had a lot!); even my mom and hubby liked it! I only have one criticism from our whole meal:  I wish the bread served would have been warm.

I've never had calamari be fried so lightly that it masked any unhealthyness that came with it. On top of that, the dish had a helping of other fried veggies to compliment the squid. I was in love with this and wish we had gotten another dish!Finally, the Sicilian Pizza was to die for! Plenty of meat for the carnivores, and the crust wasn't too thin nor thick. It was just the right amount for the ingredients on top!The drinks and food weren't the quickest to come out, but our lovely waitress made sure that our waters were filled and our bread basket was replenished.

It comes with one extra large, super-sized meatball that is easily the best in the city. Nice and tender. And they offer to grate fresh parmigiano right onto your plate, at the table. The house bread with the olive oil is also nice. Though I'd have liked it if there was some balsamic vinegar to further complement it. The only real complaint I have is that if you get a table in the front, you need to sit on a backless bar stool, which was very uncomfortable on my back.  Also, the candles at a lot of the tables had gone out. They're a really nice accent, so it'd be great if they were kept going.  But overall, it's great!",Pam P.,,,,,,

The crust was horrible and the rest of the pizza was horrible. Hardly any taste. And the four cheese seemed to be some chunks of ricotta barfed in globs and a few shaving of another cheese.  It was VERY disappointing. Quite possibly the worst pizza I ever tasted. The crust was like wet rawhide, very hard to chew. I snarled down one piece and went to bed with hopes of a better breakfast. The garlic bread with cheese. What a joke! This was not gluten free.  I knew this, when purchasing for my daughter. $10.50 for four slices of bread, the size of a mans thumb. And it missing the garlic taste.",Julie R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,6/26/16,"What a fabulous restaurant!  It was the best Italian food I've had outside of the North End in Boston and Providence RI. They prepared linguine with clams just the way I like it - in marinara. The portion was generous and the clams were fresh. My husband had the lasagna. It was delicious and beautifully prepared. Save room for dessert - it was very difficult to decide! All the choices were made fresh on the premises. I had the cannolis - you get two, so plenty to share!  The restaurant was a little noisy but it was full of people having a good time. The decor was beautiful and the service was great.",Laura W.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,6/25/16,Delicious and sweet staffs. Their meatball is so moist and tasty. I wish their portion was a little bit larger though. And it's very very hot in there.,Natsuki J.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,10/20/16,"Came here because I heard they had gluten-free pasta and pizza.  Decided to try the gluten-free pasta with arrabiata (spicy tomato) sauce.  I asked if it was super spicy and the server said it wasn't.  I'm not someone who can eat super spicy food but I do like things that are medium spicy, so I ordered it.  The pasta was done correctly, just the right al dente, which is not easy to do with the GF variety.  Unfortunately, the arrabiata was extremely spicy, so spicy I really could not eat it.  I ended up eating a bite of gluten free bread (which was delicious) with every bite of pasta, that was the only way I could eat it.  If I could return I would probably try the carbonara but I cannot recommend the arrabiata.",Julie C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,6/20/17,"Good food, slow/poor service, loud and dark.  With all great reviews, I was expecting better.  Not a place to try and have a nice conversation over your meal.  Our waitress was pretty much non-existent.  Took nearly 1.5 hours to our food, fortunately it was hot.  Unfortunately, they decided to bring it out piecemeal.",Kerry L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,6/15/16,"Amazing food, wonderful atmosphere, and nice staff. We were sitting by the open window when a man came up to us asking for money.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2007/6/17,"One of my favorites in Columbus. Spectacular spot for great Italian food. Ambiance is on point and there is always a roaring crowd.. regardless of time or night of the week. Perfect for a date night, ladies night or a group dinner. Prices are reasonable for upscale Italian and portions are also as expected. Nice Italian wine list. Boyfriend and I frequent here and have yet to find something we don't like.",Anne R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2007/6/15,"Best happy hour in Columbus, and one of my go-to places to bring friends! The happy hour is every weekday from 4-6pm (including Fridays!) and includes 1/2 off all drinks, apps, and pizzas. Between many visits and coming here in large groups, I feel like I've tried most of their happy hour menu items - here are some of my favorites:- Apps: melted pecorino cheese w/ apples and crostini (so simple yet delicious!), braised veal meatball (super tender and flavorful), calamari (crispy and I like that there's 2 dipping sauces), prosciutto bruschetta (but I can't say no to prosciutto lol)- Pizzas: four seasons (prosciutto, zucchini, mushroom, olive), pesto shrimp, and crispy potato w/ pancetta (you'd be surprised how well the potato works on pizza)- Drinks: both sangrias (although I preferred the white over red), grapefruit basil fizz, tuscan limonata - I've only ordered off their regular menu once, but the linguini & clams I got was really yummy and seafood-y Protip: for the happy hour, you just have to order your items by 6pm (not finish eating), so I've literally gotten there at 5:50pm before and ordered everything at once lol. So good, and I will definitely be back!",Marie H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2006/1/16,"I've only been to Marcella's once, but I had a five star experience.Note: I paid with a giftcard, so maybe this is slightly biased. Our server was highly attentive without being bothersome or pushy. He knew the menu well. When I asked if a specific pasta dish was vegetarian he said, ""Yes, it's actually vegan!"" He went on to say there is a vegetarian eggplant parmesan the kitchen can make that isn't listed on the menu. I got that. Every component was well-executed. The citrus sangria was bright and refreshing. The sunchoke salad came out on an ice cold plate and truly was the best salad I've ever tasted. The recommended eggplant parm was everything I want indulgent Italian food to be. It would have totally been an appropriate portion to share, but I ate it all. I rounded out the meal with a martini and tiramisu (I did share that). Side note: Their bathroom soap is amazing! Make a special trip to try it out. 2 salads, 2 entrees, 4 drinks, 1 dessert rounded out to about $50 per person before tip. Too pricey for me on a normal day, but definitely a fair value for what I got. I'm told their happy hour is a great deal, but I've never been.",J. E.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,6/21/17,"Every app, salad, and entree I've ever gotten here has been delicious, and their happy hour discounts can't be beat. I stop by for an pancetta, arugula, and tallegio pizza anytime I'm in Columbus.",S R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,8/19/16,"A Columbus staple!  If you are here as a visitor, it is a must-try.  If you are a Columbus resident and have not tried it, what are you waiting for?  The meatball alone is worth the wait time, and even the salads are amazing.  Go on a Wednesday or Sunday for 1/2 your bottle of wine.",Gina M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2004/1/16,"This is the ""Go To"" Italian restaurant in Columbus. If you are in the mood for Italian this is a no brainer. The Chicken Parmesan is usually my choice, and it never disappoints. The risotto balls are an awesome choice for an appetizer. All the apps are great though.If you are going to drive here, anticipate using the valet. Also, I would plan on making a reservation, especially if you have a decent sized group. If you are just a twosome you can usually walk in with no problem. Careful about ordering too many bottles of wine or cocktails, because your bill will explode before you even realize. The only food I can complain about is the bread... It is a little bland and boring. Bottom line: If you looking for a spot for date night, Marcella's is the perfect choice... Every time.",Les C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,5/29/16,"Good solid Italian restaurant with great service and good food. I would return.As mentioned in several of the other reviews, the atmosphere is loud, lively and packed. Definitely make reservation. Upon arrival we were seated immediately.The server appeared right away and took our drink and appetizer order. Both arrived very quickly. The calamari and cheeses were very good and served at the right temperature.My wife had the Chicken Marsala which she rated as good, but not the best she's had. My seared salmon was also good but slightly under cooked. Good, but still slightly under cooked.The desserts were excellent. So overall, we felt the appetizers and desserts were excellent and would return for these as well as try the small plates.",Dennis T.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,12/14/15,"Decent to middling food, great service, way over rated. Not worth the price.THE FOODThe salads were middling. The calamari was quite good, especially the add of the fried lemon rings. The salmon and lemon veal were very good indeed. But the sausage pizza and the pasta carbonera were pretty uninspiring. Tiramisu was quite well done but too sweet, the canolis were crazy good, but the tart with ice cream was passable.THE ATMOSPHEREThe over use of parmesan makes the place stank like olive garden. But otherwise a lively and well appointed place.THE SERVICEThis is where all the Cameron Mitchell places shine, super courteous and gracious, even if a bit syrupy.Not worth $150+",Birdy N.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,3/29/15,"I like this place. Nice atmosphere. Reminded me of some bigger city restaurants you find in places like New York (only twice as big). Full, but not crowded.

I hope I can get back for dinner.",Michael M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,5/22/17,"Read all the GF reviews (I have celiac) and thought I'd give it a try...

Thankfully, I didn't eat it. Celiacs beware ordering online! Make sure to note gluten free (or no) bread.",Laurel G.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2011/4/14,"Marcella's was one of the very first restaurants I visited after moving to Columbus. My initial dining experience was positive. This made me excited about the Columbus food scene, hoping Marcella's was an accurate representation.  I've been back a few times since and I still believe Marcella's is one of the better Italian restaurants in town. There's something formulaic about Cameron Mitchell restaurants, but the formula works so i'm not hating. You can always expect a certainly level of aesthetic in a Cameron Mitchell restaurant. The atmosphere is chic with a bar-restaurant atmosphere.  The lighting is dim and the  waiters are uniformed and polite. Marcella is a busy and noisy restaurant, yet still maintains an intimate and romantic ambiance. It's a good date spot. The food, drinks and service have been consistently good. The prosciutto and melon, melted pecorino cheese and braised veal meatball are all great appetizers. Get the prosciutto and melon if you want something light and get the meatball to share if you're more hungry. The pecorino cheese is a fun dish in that you self-assemble your own crostini with apple, honey, cheese and small pieces of bread. As far as main dishes go, i've only ordered their pasta. They have all been good. I've ordered the ravioli mezzaluna, penne alla arrabiatta and the gnocchi con bolongese. Out of the 3, the penne arrabiatta is my least favorite and most bland. The gnocchi con bolongese is the most flavorful, but at the same time the most rich and filling. It comes with melt-in-your-mouth braised lamb and a generous amount of parmesan reggiano. Not for the fainthearted though. The ravioli mezzaluna is a good compromise in terms of taste and quantity. The goat cheese ravioli, bacon and mushrooms will satisfy your tastebuds without leaving you uncomfortably full. My date ordered the chicken marsala and seemed pretty content with it. I usually don't have room for dessert (order too many appetizers), but on one occasion I did have the Tiramisu and it was good. Overall, Marcella's is a excellent Italian option in the Short North. It's busy and trendy for a reason. The food and service are consistently good.  There are definitely quieter spots out there, but if you're planning a night on the town afterwards, there are not too many better places. I will be back.",Arvid Y.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,9/23/15,"As if to commit a cardinal sin, I don't care for pasta--YET I found myself at the Italian restaurant. Tonight, I decided to check out the Short North district for dinner. After sharking around for a place to park in the neighborhood, I followed the tide down to the main drag. I stopped at Marcella's window to surf the menu and was greeted with an on street recommendation that the pasta + meatball was ""to die for"". Me, not caring for pasta, was looking at the pizza, but decided to take her word for it. The place was busy, so that had to be a good sign. I sat at the bar and was served immediately. A drink that was en route to a table caught my eye, and when I asked about and decided to order it, the bartender subbed me the one meant for the table right on the spot. I ordered the margarita pizza, and it was good. I've been spoiled by the Yia Yia pizza gods, so I can't say it's the best I've ever had but would definitely order again.Finished up dinner with a glass of red wine & left very happy that I followed the flow into Marcella's.",Neale S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2011/10/15,"Not gonna lie I wasn't a huge fan of this place.  I thought overall the food was just mediocre, and definitely not worthy of the price.  We were able to try their veal meatballs, the arancini, and their gnocchi.  Of the three, I was most impressed with the gnocchi which was cooked well and had a nice flavorful meat sauce.  The other two dishes, though, felt a little flat and could have used more seasoning.  I will say that the portions were pretty good though, as those three dishes were more than enough for two people.Service here was a highlight and the servers were very friendly and helped with any questions we had.  This place gets crazy busy during peak times though, so I would highly recommend a reservation.  And parking is not fun here lol.  good luck.",Zach T.,,,,,,

The places makes you feel like you need to be someone to be in line there (and there is going to be a line and there won't really be anywhere comfortably to stand so be prepared for the awkward by standards).The place does have that Hoboken feel- you know that feeling where they have enough business so don't care how they treat you. Didn't really appreciate the lack of smiles and general unenthusiastic, brisk attitude of the hostess'. Expect 45 min wait times on a Friday evening if you're willing to wait. I wasn't. Two stars just for being popular despite inability to be diplomatic. 1 additional star for drink variety/selection. I'll update if I ever feel like being treated rudely and decide to actually try the ""service"".",Charitee J.,,,,,,

My sangria was pretty small but still $8. 20-30 min wait for a table but luckily there was a space at the bar for both of us. I had chicken Parmesan and he had chicken giardenara and I really liked the pasta with mine (Alfredo!) but my boyfriend wished there was something else with his besides just chicken and the vegetables.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2006/5/16,"I had a great experience at Marcellas. I went during happy hour with some friends and I will definitely be going again. Happy hour is 4-6, and all cocktails and beers on tap (which there are only two on tap) are half off. Small plates, salads, and pizzas are half off too. We had an excellent three course meal; our salads were $3.50 each, $5 dollar drinks, $7 pizzas and $5ish dollar melted cheese dish. The cocktails were well worth $5, we had the lemon one and the strawberry martini one; both a little on the sweet side, but so refreshing. Salads aren't too fancy, but the pizza was out of this world. We had the mushroom pizza, which had truffle oil on it. It was one of the best mushroom pizzas I've ever had! We had sausage too and I'd have to say it was one of the best sausage pizzas I've ever had!",Maggie F.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2/14/15,"Two words: Happy Hour. You'll leave feeling stuffed and not wanting to eat again for the next three days, but your wallet will only be at most $15-20 lighter, if even. I am a huge fan of their mushroom pizza, which I've ordered 2 out of the 3 times I've come. Just the thought of that thin-crust truffle-oil covered mushroom and taleggio cheese makes me salivate. Easily one of the best thin-crust and/or mushroom pizzas I've ever had. I've also tried their calamari multiple times, and while my friends all rave about this appetizer, I'm not too sold on it. Rest assured, it's not bad by any means, but it just doesn't really stand out to me. Moreover, I find myself preferring to nibble on the fried veggies rather than the calamari itself. Their caprese salad is spot on in terms of flavor, although the cheese and tomato slices are a bit bigger than I'd expect. With regards to dessert, I've tried both the Tiramisu and the Profiteroles, and you really can't go wrong with either. Personally, I found the Profiteroles a bit more unique and enjoyable, partly because you can find Tiramisu just about anywhere, but their Tiramisu is nonetheless still a solid choice (just not as memorable as the Profiteroles). My favorite aspect of the profiteroles is probably the fact that they're literally bite-sized, so you can just go CHOMP and enjoy this delectable treasure.",Ying X.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,8/14/14,"Marcella's was an amazing experience!We went here after the travesty of dining at HP, on our first trip ever to Columbus Ohio.  (Shout out again, Columbus - you are a super neat city!)Huge link to my HP review:  (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyde-park-prime-steakhouse-columbus?hrid=yn3FM25YC7vHbcbIp2cBSw)  After the aforementioned dinner, we wandered the Short North for a bit, grabbed a drink with Theron's parents, then said our 'goodbye's for the night as they returned to the hotel and we went dancing in the streets.Literally, there was music coming from all the open restaurants and bars, and we danced while waiting to cross the street.  We happened to be in front of what appeared to be a delicious ice cream shop and made a whole lot of kids laugh. Good times! :)We went to Marcella's first and foremost because it was still open, not loud, and yet was still crowded - as it had been all evening and night with well-dressed Columbus(ites?).  My first question at the host stand was, ""Are you guys closing soon?  Because I don't want to be one of those guests that comes in right before close.""Answer? A very friendly, ""No, we don't close till midnight!""  (It was a Friday).An amazingly friendly waiter made our trip to this establishment all the better.  He suggested three of his favorite red wines (all their wines are from Italy, so really, if you know which Italian wine you like just get that, or if you don't, maybe study before you go.)  We didn't really care for any of them, but ordered a carafe anyway.My husband kept saying Marcella's reminded him of our favorite pizza spot back in Chicago - where we first fell in love.  It was easy to see why, as it is dimly lit, with a lot of red touches, and a cozy atmosphere.A big difference, however, is that wine is served in carafes here, and the pizza is served on a stand, with stacked plates under it.When our gregarious waiter came back to take our order, I was pretty bummed already as I didn't see the option to make your own pizza.I asked, ""what is the spiciest thing you have?""  He replied, ""well the penne arrabiata for sure.""  I asked, ""but nothing pizza-wise?""And then he said such magical words:""Hhmm... not specifically, but we can make it anyway you want.""A kitchen that doesn't mind making something *any* way you want? I tested that theory.  ""Can we make the sauce arrabiata sauce instead of your typical pizza sauce?""""Of course! I don't see why that would be a problem!""(Say what?!)""Um.. well.. I don't see jalapenos listed on here, do you have those for a topping?""""Sure!  We should be able to scrounge some up for you!""(Hello?  Is this place for real?)Then we went about ordering our other typical favorite toppings: pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, and sometimes black olives.  The waiter graciously took our order to the kitchen while my husband and I stared at each other, smiling in disbelief.When the pie came out, no lie, it was made exactly as we'd asked.  The spice of the sauce grew hotter the more you ate it, the jalapenos were perfect, and the crust was just between thin and medium thickness - and crunchy, of course.He also gave us a side of arrabiata sauce in case we wanted more.What a great salvation to the dinner we'd had earlier, and what a wonderful way to end our first (but hopefully not last) night in Columbus, OH.I wish I had gotten the waiter's name - but if you see this and remember a pink-haired girl and dark haired guy ordering spicy pizza, thank you!And thank you, Marcella's!I would love to come back and try your small plates ^^",Valerie J.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,4/13/16,"This definitely was not the best Italian meal I've ever had, but the service was great. There was a fruit fly in my Manhattan, and when I brought it up, they immediately gave me a new one free of charge. Their drink selections are also a plus. The sangria is great, and I would recommend getting the pitcher rather than just a single glass.I was a little bit disappointed however because I had high expectations from reviews and referrals. I really didn't think the food was great for the price. It sounds dumb, but I was also not a huge fan of how dark it was in the restaurant.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,9/17/14,"Marcella's was one of the first real restaurants I went to when I moved to Columbus, and I loved everything about it.

I try to order something different every time I go, but I always get sucked into happy hour deals if I'm there from 4 to 6, you can't say no to half price pizzas! Also their beet and goat cheese salad is one of my favorite foods on the planet, I would highly recommend it.The environment at Marcella's is very cozy, there's dim lighting and the tables are VERY close together, but if you're into the romantic vibe it's nice. If you're not prepared to be surrounded by 100 couples on first dates and another 100 girls' birthday dinners, then I wouldn't recommend it.",Gina M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2009/3/15,"I visited Marcella's for dinner on my last trip to Columbus. We'll start by saying that a reservation is recommended for this place; otherwise you'll be waiting all evening for a table.The best part about this place is the warm bread and oil/balsamic served before your meal.  I ordered the fettuccine and meatball as me entree, and was disappointed after the glowing reviews. The meatball was good, albeit lukewarm, but the fettuccine was average and the sauce tasted a little too much like ketchup. I will say that I tasted my friend's calamari, as well as the linguine and clams and was impressed. Might need to reconsider my entree selection if I make it back here again.",Amy L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,10/15/14,"Though I'm not a big fan of Italian cuisine, Italian restaurants are notorious for serving up delicious calamari, so when I explained my Calamari Quest to the locals, they all suggested Marcella's. Now I know why. This calamari was as close to perfect as I could ever expect. It was fried and seasoned perfectly and the sauces complemented the dish perfectly. I'm a believer that calamari shouldn't NEED sauce, but the garlic aioli that they serve with it took it to the next level. I'm also not a fan of fillers in my calamari, and was disappointed at the presence of zucchini in the dish. To my delight, the zucchini was also fried and seasoned perfectly, I just don't think it belongs in my calamari. Great calamari needs no fillers and this calamari was great! Because of this, I rate the calamari at Marcella's a 4.5 tentacles out of 5 on The Calamari Quest page. That's a big deal, and I have a new entrant into my top 5! With me, it's all about the calamari, but I must mention the lamb gnocchi, which was also delicious!

THE VEAL MEATBALL.I don't think I'd ever tried veal before, nor have I ever been a big fan of meatballs, but I would order a thousand of these appetizers and make that my meal if I could. Our group was in town for our girlfriend's wedding shower, and 10 PM was the earliest they could take our size group (7) when we made our reservations at 5 PM that same day. It worked out perfectly, since we were drinking wine and snacking before we went out for food. Our waiter was such a good sport for dealing with us loud and tipsy women.

It's only for two hours though so get here between 4-6pm to partake.First of all, half off everything on the menu except entrees...including wine and cocktails. My friends and I each got the medium sized pitcher of wine for around $8 (regular price $16). It ended up being about 2.5 glasses of wine so a GREAT deal. For my meal, I had a chopped salad and a pepperoni pizza that had red onion on it too. It was DELICIOUS! Thin crust, perfect toppings, and I took my leftovers home. Again, half off my whole meal. Bam. We also shared some apps like calamari, arancini, and the fried zucchini. All perfectly cooked and delicious.I also love this place because it feels fancy but without being overpriced. It reminds me of a 60s restaurant with low lighting and cool decor but it's not kitschy. It's just a relaxing place for a nice night out with your friends and/or family. I mean, you really can't go wrong with a Cameron Mitchell restaurant.",Lisa P.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2011/6/14,"I bought a group of 25 to Marcella's for a new professional's dinner. The server, Emily, did a great job making sure everyone was taken care of. Marcella's went out of their way to accommodate our group for this event, even at the last minute. The food was AWESOME! I had the RAVIOLI MEZZALUNA, which was so good. The goat cheese was not too much and made a great dish. It was not that pricey, either. The calamari was great; maybe one of the best plates have had of Calamari. Everyone enjoyed their food. I would highly recommend coming to dine here. The place was packed, even on a Monday so make sure you come to dinner early or make a reservation.",Sharee M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,7/20/15,"After reading many, many reviews on Yelp, I also asked a local which restaurant I shouldn't miss while in Columbus and Marcella's was the first one he mentioned. I remembered the 4 stars received on Yelp so I headed this way.1. Melted Pecorino Cheese with Crostini, Apple and Truffle honey ($10)One on of the first reviews I read noted this was a must have so it was the first item ordered.OMG, it was worth all the rave. Deliciously melted cheese with an awesomely crispy 'crostini' which is actually perfectly toasted or fried or baked toast, who cares! It was so crispy delicious. Then you dip it in cheese and then truffle honey, and add some fresh green apple slices, BAM!, what a mixture of texture, sweet and salty and freshness! It's a definite must have. Do yourself a favor though, once it is served, take the apples off the crostini. Beautiful presentation but if you leave it on, the bread will get soggy and you will lose the texture.2. Braised Veal Meatball ($9)Forgot I wanted to order this so I ended up ordering the beet salad and then had to add this. I must say it is one of the most moist and tender, flavorful meatballs I've ever had. Served in a cute mini cast iron pot, it's one of the definites here.3. Beef Carpaccio ($11) with shaved celery and warm ricotta pancakesWell, for $11, they gave a pretty good portion of carpaccio. It was good but the 'dressing/oil' was salty. I forgot there were ricotta pancakes underneath which I discovered a 1/3 into eating. It was a better balance of flavors with the pancake but still too salty overall. The quality of the carpaccio and quantity were great for the value though. What j didn't see much were the shaved celery.4. Beet Salad ($7.50): Roasted Crimson and Golden Beets, wild arugula, goat cheese and candied walnuts.Overall tasty beets and goat cheese. The candied walnuts were the Bomb! Again, however, went overboard with the dressing so things were too vinegary. Overwhelmed the naturally beautiful combo flavor of the beets, goat cheese with the spicy arugula and the texture and sweetness of the candied walnuts. A bit less dressing and it would be fabulous. But then again, a goat and beet salad for $7.50? No complaints, huh?5. And by this time I was stuffed but since my time in Columbus was limited I asked which one, lasagna or the risotto of the day ($17) she said shrimp and saffron risotto so knowing full well I was only going to take a bite and rest to go, I ordered. The portion that came out was especially huge and I had some cheese shaved on top. Again, the dish was overly salty but the flavors were flavorful, especially the charred garlic slices which added a nice depth. Until this juncture, I was a bit disappointed with the service. Granted the restaurant was extremely busy, even on a Monday night so I sat at the bar and the two bartenders seemed overwhelmed so the attention to service I was now expecting at Columbus wasn't there, i.e. no smile to be found on the face. But when she asked how the risotto was and I said it was salty, she asked whether they could do it over and I said it was fine but then she said she'll have them add more risotto to mix in and so I said sure. She brought the adjusted dish out and suggested I try it before I take it to go and I did. It was still salty but the extra effort is all I needed to be satisfied and happy. So the continued wonderful service of Columbus wait staff isn't tarnished after all!Now the biggest Tip ever is to go during happy hour!! I could kick myself for not realizing this before I came. I could've double the number of apps I could've tried for the same money!! ^^Okay, wish there was a way to give it an extra 1/2 stars. The waitress just to the risotto off the bill. Kudos for service!!",June K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,10/28/14,"Hands down best happy hour in Columbus. The happy hour is 4-6 pm Monday through Friday so its pretty extensive. It's pretty unusual to have a happy hour on Friday, so this is usually my go-to place if I'm looking to go out to eat Friday after work. Many of the drinks, appetizers, and the pizzas are half price and everything is super delicious. I've had their apple/cheese appetizer, their big meatball appetizer, and many of their flatbread pizzas during happy hour and was never disappointed. Their sangria is also pretty good and at a relatively good price for a pitcher to share at a table. They are also pretty accommodating for groups. I love Marcella's and will continue to go back as long as I am in Columbus!",Tiffany W.,,,,,,

They're always happy to recreate something not currently on the menu if possible (Milan Manhattan and Strawberry-Basil Martini are particular favorites). Get the big meatball. Just do it, even if you just stop for drinks, get the meatball. Soft and unctuous and amazing. And the pizza, perfectly crispy bottom, just a bit of char.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2011/9/14,"We had a WONDERFUL night at Marcellas! Every... Single... Thing was amazing.We started with the melted pecorino, calamari and bruschetta appetizers. The biggest surprise was the calamari and the fried lemon hidden in the mix! Surprisingly delicious. My main course was the carbonara with gluten free penne. They served it with an egg yolk on top and it put this dish over the top. Unbelievably yummy. My sister in law had the fettuccine with a meatball ... Everyone agreed that this was the best meatball anyone had ever had. So tender and flavorful. Hubby had the veal saltimbocca... Cooked perfectly. There were no leftovers. I also loved the Tuscan Limonata cocktail. They make their own limoncello in house. So good. I am going to venture to say that you can't get a bad meal at Marcellas.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2007/3/14,"If we'd gotten our food within the hour of ordering it, I would have given this restaurant 5 stars, but alas, I and several other patrons had to complain to our server and the manager about the time it took to get our food. I even jokingly told my friends that they can't call themselves a restaurant if they don't serve any food.It took more than an hour after placing our order to get the food. We were starving by the time it got to us. We all scarfed the food. It was delicious, but I can't say that the delay didn't color my opinion of the restaurant. The manager had to be asked to make some accommodation for the long delay. It was not offered up front.",Doreen E.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,9/16/15,"Huzzah! Another top notch happy hour in Cbus! Met the ladies here last night for a cluck fest and had some amazing snacks to boot! All at half freaking price. Yassss. I've been here before for dinner and wasn't totally blown away, but happy hour is a different story. During happy hour, drinks, snacks, apps, salads, and pizzas are all half off and it is not nearly as crowded as it gets during the dinner hours. We had a delightful server named Alex who kept the drinks flowing. Our snacks included the assorted olives and 3 cheeses: fontina, goat, and a creamy semi stinky number that started with a ""T"". All fabulous. I ordered the beet salad and the other ladies had the caprese, then we had the crispy potato pizza. All outstanding. For drinks we split a ""litro"" of red sangria (yum) and I had the Milan Manhattan. A little too sweet for my taste, but it's beautiful and I could see someone making that a favorite go to cocktail. Walked out of there for $25. Great food and service to match. Make this your next happy hour destination.",Jen R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,7/21/15,"Decent place. Overrated meatballs. Mushy and seems like a lot of bread in them. Nothing special you can't get in any respectable family owned Italian restaurant.Otherwise fine Italian food and in a great location.  Staff is professional.",Rob R.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2010/3/15,"I'm going to compare this restaurant to Sotto in Cincinnati, which I feel for the price point is a much better restaurant. Marcella's is really just a glorified Magianos with edible food. We went here when staying in town and had reservations at 8. The service and host were great. We were seated quickly on a very busy night and our server was on point.  Food was the sad face. The bread is brought out cold and is nothing special, something you could get at Kroger with the label of Italian anything. We had the  zucchini appetizer which was also brought out cold and saturated with oil. The wine selection was fine.  Our entrÌ©es were good, we had the gnocchi and then clams. These were great but nothing that you couldn't get anywhere else. For dessert we had the cannoli, which the filling was runny and sloppily placed. The shell was stale, no crunch to it. Would have been okay if we were at an Olive Garden for some horrible  reason and everything was free. Overall this place is very ""eh""  maybe they were just busy that night but if I was blindfolded I would have thought this was any Italian chain restaurant.",Patrick R.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2003/1/14,"Marcella's Ristorante sets a very nice atmosphere for group of friends or for a nice dinner for two in the Short North area of Columbus. My first visit was a Friday night with 3 others and for that we made a reservation at 6:15PM.  Seated finally at 6:45PM, being told they were a little behind, was understood.  Marcella's had our reservation and that's half of any good restaurant battle.The entire place was buzzing and I like that when out with friends.  To our left was a table of 6 with women out on the town really having fun. Behind me were two couples. To my opposite side was a family of 4 with one being a 10 or so year old child.  All good so Marcella's is equally comfortable with anyone.  Style and apparel was not in question either; folks dressed up and dressed down.  Hey, it's a nice Italian restaurant that's comfy.Meals.  Our table had chicken piccatta, linguini with clams, lasagna and chicken marsala.  I had the linguini and clams - pasta was perfectly al dente and the clams, while smallish and few (4 - 5 clams) they were tasty.  Paired with a pinot grigio made a nice meal.  Pals said their meals were good albeit the lasagna eater claimed too much sauce that had a acidic taint to it; he had to pull off most of the topping.   The table had calamari as an app and it was good.The pricing was moderate for being a Cameron Mitchell place.  I found the restaurant to be fun, lively and ready to build most any meal and environment it could for the customers.  Our server was prompt, cordial and had a consistent method of visiting and filling water glasses.Yup - I'll visit again.  I would like to try it on, say, a Wednesday or a Thursday with a friend to see if it's quieter, to take more of Marcella's in with my 5 senses.",Walt S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2/28/16,"One of my fave Columbus spots. It's a can't miss when I'm in city for work trips. The penne arriabiata is delicious and spicy. Get it with a meatball!! Also the pecorino is delicious the honey, apple, and hot melted cheese is delish!",Kimberly R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2003/2/15,"My 5 star rating is solely on the merit of Marcella's ridiculously awesome happy hour.Something kinduv weird happens when you become a parent.  Well, a lot of weird things happen, but this is one that no one really mentions but should be pretty obvious:  happy hours will become ABSOLUTELY SACRED.  And i mean sacred in the truest sense of the word.  I don't consider myself a religious man, but if you take away my happy hour, God help you.Anyways, so basically since moving back to Columbus, my wife and I have frequented quite a few different happy hours.  What we're looking for: good price points for drink and food specials, an accessible and diverse menu, and an attractive environment for us to feel like we're a lot less responsible than we should be.Prior to coming to Marcella's for happy hour, our go to spot was The Pearl, pretty much next door (which is a really brilliant business model), namely because my wife is a sucker for fresh oysters, and I'm a sucker for their amazeballs fried cheese curds (no, seriously, hard to screw up fried cheese curds, but the curds here are something exceptional).  But the rest of The Pearl's food specials, while decent, are a tad uninspired.We sat at Marcella's bar, wife was thrilled with her martini (and ultimately ordered 3 more #YOLO), and when I asked about the food specials, the bartender pointed out literally half of the menu.  HALF OF THE MENU.  HALF OFF.  incredible.So, five drinks, one pizza, and like 5 other dishes later, we rang out to the tune of something like $40 all told.  remember me talking about not being a religious man?  maybe my perception is skewed from east coast living, but sans angels singing and the heavens parting, that is truly a miracle.",Johaun C.,,,,,,

We were early for our reservation and told that they still had a few 7:45 reservations to seat.  Perfect, I needed a cocktail!

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,5/15/14,"I've heard great things about their happy hour, and finally had the chance to stop in around 5pm on a Thursday for some great food and drink in the lounge area. These were some of the items that we tried:1) Veal meatball - there's only one in each order but it's ginormoso. This was my favorite thing that we ordered, the meatball is so tender and veal is among my favorite proteins. If I was dining alone I'd probably just nom on a bunch of these little monsters.2) Fried calamari - pretty standard as expected, but good since you can't really go wrong with this dish in most places3) Crispy potato pizza - just okay, I wish there was more meat on it maybe. It's supposed to have pancetta but I don't think that I found a single piece. The crispy potatoes are kinda just really crispy artisan potato chips, which give it a cool texture I guess. Overall it was just a tad saltier than I like as well. 4) Citro Fresca cocktail - lovely! I adore refreshing drinks that aren't too sweet, and this fits the bill. I nommed on the grapefruit garnish at the end of my meal and it was a great palate cleanser too.5) Grapefruit Basil Fizz - bf ordered this, he liked it but it's a tad too sweet for me6) Milan Manhattan - bf ordered this, it's too strong for meWe were absolutely stuffed after our meal, and the prices are reasonable -- like what I'd expect dinner to cost at a regular restaurant, but this is a Cameron Mitchell so it's almost a steal. Our server was great, as he was just attentive enough to make us feel like we were taken care of but not at all overbearing. The vibe was fun and I liked this place a lot, so I would love to try the regular dinner here eventually.",Helen S.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2/16/14,"Every time I come back to visit Columbus, I make sure to make a trip to Marcella's in Short North. It has to be this location, and it has to be Marcella's. It's almost tradition among my friends and I, and that's really a testament to how awesome Marcella's is. It might seem like it has a chain restaurant vibe to it, but the quality of food is far better than most chain restaurants, and the service is always very friendly and attentive. Happy hour specials are pretty awesome here. I might be a little biased since I'm used to New York prices, but we always come here for happy hour and load up on drinks and happy hour food. The arancini (fried rice balls) are pretty killer here, and they're a lot bigger than most I've seen at most Italian restaurants. I've also had most of the pastas and pizzas here, and you really can't go wrong. I'm a big fan of the Sicilian and the mushroom pizzas, and spaghetti carbonara is pretty great. The portions are pretty big in my opinion, and I always leave feeling full and satisfied. The usual crowd at Marcella's consists of mostly yuppies, so if that's not your scene, then this might be a place to avoid. But regardless if you're sitting for a meal or chilling at the bar, it's always very lively and hip. I think it's hard to feel uncomfortable here.

If you like tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, highly recommend the Parma Prosciutto Bruschetta. the tomato sauce is sooooo delicious and cheese is very fresh. Perfect combination! For entree, the Spaghetti & Meatball is always good. EVERYTHING about it is good. A lot of time I will have left overs and even microwave it the next day still tastes delicious. I also enjoy the Linquize & Clams.

He told me I would not be disappointed, and I was not! The braised lamb was melt in your mouth tender, and the gnocchi was light, pillowy, and delicious. My wife had the spaghetti and meat ball (one large one) and it was solid. 2 others in our party had pizzas. The pepperoni was good, the mushroom was a little light on sauce.

Really, just as if it were a restaurant  in italy!The setup is intended so that you can easily share your meals with the rest of your party, and it makes for a wonderfully comfortable atmostphere.

But the Risotto! OMG! The dish is different each day based on what the Chef decides. Last night it was served with sausage and broccolini with Parmesan and sprinkled with Gorgonzola. It was incredible! I've never had anything that wasn't good, but this dish took it to a whole new level.",Carolyn G.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2007/11/15,"Very close to an actual Italian experience with the exception of the pop music being played. Great bread and olive oil served in the beginning. I would avoid the olives (extremely salty). Carbonara is best I've had in the U.S. Margarita pizza is authentic. Drinks were great. Although our table felt a little cramped because much of the food was spread out to be shared, the ambience is excellent and doesn't have a ""chain restaurant"" feel. We would go back and defiantly recommend it to our friends.",Jeremy T.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,3/15/16,Meatball and fettuccine is so good! I asked for penne instead. The white sauce mixed with the marinara with the meatball - turns into a vodka like sauce. It was delicious! I've been here on plenty of occasions.,Alice C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,11/14/16,"Simply fantastic dining experience. From the friendly waitstaff to the absolutely delicious cuisine, this place is a true gem of Columbus. Truly the best Italian food I have had stateside. Will continue to come here with any excuse to celebrate.",Jacob W.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,6/27/15,"Great service, amazing gluten free menu. Loved the lamb shank bolognese with gluten free penne.  3 cheese platter for an appetizer can't be topped.",Jen H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,6/23/15,"Five stars is for the Marcella's happy hour (dinner is great too, but the prices and atmosphere of happy hour make it the ideal time to check out this restaurant), which is a MUST when looking for an after work cocktail and delicious early dinner. The appetizers are half-off, including the amazing HUGE meatball that comes soaked in a delicious house made red sauce. Now that it's getting warmer make sure you get there early (happy hour starts at 4pm)- you can snag a high top table by the large, widely-open windows in the front the of the restaurant. Warm breeze, a glass of wine, and delicious arancini- best way to spend a weeknight summer evening in columbus!",Margaret K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2003/5/15,"The best meatball you'll ever eat is served here, also the best chicken parm and the some of the best pizza's in town... Are you starting to sense a theme? I'm no expert but this is some of the best Italian food I've ever had. It's reasonably priced and their decor and atmosphere are always enchanting. It's the kind of place right out of magazine. Cameron Mitchell strikes again and again and again and again. =)",Jay D.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,2012/3/14,"Overall, the service was okay. Myself along with two other friends were visiting from Chicago during Thanksgiving weekend. We booked a table the day before on OpenTable.com and when we arrived, we were immediately seated in the bar area at the high tops where it was extremely crowed. The whole point of us making a reservation was to reserve a great table which did not happen.Also, our server seemed like he was in a rush the whole night as if he had too many tables and was not personable. Additionally, the air temperature in the restaurant was extremely cold and after hearing other patrons complain about the air temperature also, we requested a new table which was much better. When our food arrived, my partner's entree seemed a bit cold but we did not complain as, we were already experiencing issues and it was busy. A manager never came over to our table to offer an apology or to see what was going on which was a little disappointing after we had heard such great things about the restaurant. Overall, everything was just okay but could have been better.",Christopher J.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2/15/15,"MEATBALL APPETIZER, FRIENDS. Made a res for Valentine's Day about a month in advance--decided to go at 9 hoping it might be a little less crowded, but it was still totes packed. Also, there's valet which is so crucial when it's negative a billion degrees outside and Wizard of Oz-style winds. The valet serves about four restaurants all in the same area, so we had to wait a few minutes for spots to open up, but it was pretty quick and the guys were moving at light speed to get to everyone. Once we got inside, we were seated right away. The gf and I both had cocktails--I went for the Grapefruit Basil Fizz and she opted for the Strawberry Balsamic Martini. The fizz wasn't fizzy, but was freaking delicious so I had to have a second. We started with a cheeseboard--pretty standard, comes with some kind of apricot thing and truffle honey, which is really easy to spill on yourself if you've consumed two cocktails at a Usain Bolt pace. We also went for the veal meatball--the waiter went out of his way to check whether or not it had pork in it for me (it doesn't) and it was so worth the extra checking. It may be weird to say this about meat, but it was the size of a softball and melts in your mouth (that's what she said). Tomato sauce was delicious. The gf and I split Chicken Picatta and the gnocchi feature. Both were great. I ordered the panna cotta for dessert and she chose the profiteroles. Overall, it was a delish din, loved the apps, could have done without the 'zerts. I held back the fifth start because they didn't have any soups on the menu, and since it was so cold, it would have been nice to have the option. Also, our waiter was extremely attentive, but we didn't order our entrees until we were halfway done with our appetizers. We'll be back for the cocktails and the meatball (appetizer, not Snooki).",Jess R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2005/9/16,We come here every Mother's Day for lunch and Marcella's never disappoints - another great meal and day at Marcellas!,Dave A.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2011/9/13,"Italian can be really boring and uninspired.  Marcella's avoids those pitfalls with delicious food and drinks and a wonderful atmosphere.The veal saltimbocca is incredibly delicious, as is the gnocchi.  The cheese plate has some wonderful choices.  The drinks are strong and delicious.  Holy crap, can they make a Manhattan!  Good bottled beer list too.I love the atmosphere.  It's always busy, crowded, loud, buzzing--not a great place to go for a quiet evening, but it is nice if you want an interesting atmosphere.  It reminds me of restaurants in busy areas of New York and Chicago.  Good service with friendly bartenders and servers.Probably the best Italian food I've had in town.",Doug O.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2002/10/16,"Marcella's will always be crowded (like a line forms at the door at 4pm) because it has good Italian food and a lovely atmosphere. But I think you can find that at a lot of restaurants in the area. What you won't find at those other restaurants is AWESOME service! That's what gives Marcella's an extra star in my book. The hosts and hostesses are friendly. The wait staff is not only on top of service, but they know their stuff. They are able to make wonderful recommendations based on what you like and what works together. Coming here is more of a dining experience compared to other Italian restaurants around. You know without a doubt that the food is consistently delicious and that your dinner will go off without a single hiccup (unless you drink a little too much Chianti!).",Amanda C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2010/10/16,"Wow, so this place rocks...be sure to mix up the appetizers the onion with the veal meat balll...the melted pecorino cheese with truffle honey..oh ya!  Just come here and spend your money you won't be disappointed.",Chris D.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,3/19/15,"Now don't get too excited by the pictures. The theme of the two places I've been in the two nights out on High Street bare the same small portions at average prices. After looking at the menu I thought I would control myself from ordering a big pasta dish, so I decided on the Meatball and Caesar Salad with white anchovies. First off the sauce with the meatball was excellent, the size of the Meatball was great, but I sense a bit of filler not all meat hence why it was so light. The salad was most disappointing. Long strips of lettuce that required too much cutting, two small pieces of anchovies hidden under the cheese and no offering of fresh ground pepper. When the order was delivered I even asked where are the anchovies and the waiter said they are under there somewhere. Interesting. He remarked that he hated anchovies so much for pleasing his client.Seems like a nice place to have a glass of wine and a light dinner at reasonable prices. The place was full and it had a good vibe.",Jim G.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,4/25/16,Wife and I were in town for Garth Brooks show and stopped in for dinner. Great atmosphere on a beautiful day (sit by the big open window in front for great people watching on a sunny day.) You must order the melted pecorino with apples and honey appetizer - if i could give it 6 stars i would. Also a huge fan of the brick oven chicken piccata. The piccata sauce was wonderful over the pasta and the brick oven made the chicken skin crisp while leaving the bird itself juicy. Great wine selection. Overall a wonderful place...wish there was one in Indy!!,Jarrett C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,4/23/16,"Prices are goodService was greatFood is Great!Place is very popular. I recommend getting a reservation before .One of the best places in town",Seamus S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,3/13/16,"Wow.  Yes, wow. This is the best Italian that I have had in North America.  The freshest prosciutto and salamis.  Getting the caponata is an absolute must.  Trust me on this. You will be so glad you did.  The beet salad was delicious with leaves as soft as butter and beets roasted to perfection. The potato Calabrese's had more flavor than a potato should ever have. Absolutely incredible.Tiramisu was amazing.  Our server Jodi was so helpful and thorough and took care of every detail.This place is a gem.  I highly recommend it to the world!",M T.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2005/8/15,"Good food overall. Server wasn't super friendly but he did his job for the most part. I would typically give this a 4 star review but overall service was poor. The pizza with mushroom and tellagio cheese was awesome as was the meatball with fettuccini. I also liked their anchovy and their chopped salad was good too. Drinks were meh.",Sean K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2009/8/16,I came here with my partner while visiting Columbus on the recommendation of a friend and we were not disappointed. We started with cocktails which were delicious. We had the melted pecorino cheese for our appetizer which was delicious. For our main course we had the meatball with a mixed red and white sauce and risotto which was on special that night and they were amazing. The meatball is incredible. The service was wonderful as well. Will definitely be back!,Jon F.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2005/4/15,"Oh. My. Goodness.Marcella's. My favorite restaurant in Columbus in more ways than one. Let me break them down for you, simply, here.1. The food, of course.I've been to Marcella's quite a few times in the past few years, and I can say that everything I've had from there has been ah-mazing. From their pastas to their pizzas to their appetizers (you MUST try the melted pecorino cheese app) to their sangria, everything is just fantastic. A lot of the dishes are sharable, which makes for a fun experience if you choose to go that direction.2. The ambiance.I feel like I'm being transported into a restaurant in NYC's Little Italy or to Italy itself (assuming that this is what I IMAGINE Italy to look and feel like). The Short North is already a great environment, and I feel like Marcella's ambiance just takes it to a whole new level. This is a fantastic place to go for a date or a girls' night... or really just any time. Note: I've been to the Polaris location, too -- still amazing food, but ambiance is a little more family-oriented. Another note: You can get away with as dressy as you want. I've seen little black dresses and shirts and ties. I've also seen jeans and a nice shirt. Fun to just go with whatever you're feeling for the occasion. 3. The prices. After No. 1 and 2, one might assume that this place would be very pricey. But the good news is that it's super affordable for the quality of food and atmosphere that you are getting here. My typical trip here consists of dinner for two: 2 glasses of wine or sangria, two apps and an entree or three small plates. And we usually get out of there at around $50. For a really nice dinner and drinks for two, I feel like that's a steal. In my opinion, Marcella's is a must-try in Columbus.",Lauren B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,1/15/15,Marcella's is a great place to go for a date or a dinner with friends.  They have an entire gluten-free menu and the gluten free pasta is very good.  The staff are always very friendly and helpful.  There are two locations and I once made the mistake of making a reservation at the wrong one but they were gracious enough to make space for me and my seven friends.  I have never had a negative experience at Marcella's throughout many years of dining there.,Erica R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2009/1/14,"Marcella's is my favorite restaurant in Short North and easily my favorite Italian restaurant in Columbus. This Cameron Mitchell restaurant will not fail to satisfy. The braised veal meatball is phenomenal. The spaghetti and meatball is huge and equally as appealing. I also recommend the lamb gnocchi. Best for last...the cheese pecorino appetizer. It is easily my favorite thing on the menu. The mix of melted cheese with apple is perfect. The service is excellent and the atmosphere inviting. However, it is a very popular place and you should be prepared for a wait during peak hours.",Megan B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,4/17/13,"I'm looking forward to visiting Columbus very soon. Specifically, to patronize Marcella's once again.  Cameron Mitchell...you've got my vote and you've got my business.Marcella's is dark and intimate, with a rambling sprawl of chatter exuding from the lengthy bar that runs along the side of the establishment.  The banter, chitchat, giggles and guffaws (yes, I did just say guffaws) are reminiscent of the soundtracks of jovial celebration (and, yes, I did say jovial) from the television shows of the eighties.The service here is second to none.  After being seated, we were given bread and water (kind of sounds like prison...but I doubt the bread is this good in prison).  Our waiter took our drink orders and only managed to approach us when we needed him to do so.  This was remarkable considering how busy Marcella's was.To start off, we had the prosciutto and melon.  This is an incredible appetizer as it warms you up with a sweet and savory combination.In the batter's box was the crispy potato pizza.  Yes, I realize this isn't an appetizer...but we decided to make it one.  This is without a doubt, one of my favorite pizzas ever.  The Tellagio and Parmesan onions combined to do a little dance on the taste-buds, while the Pancetta only deepened the flavor.  The arugula in combination with the pizza's thin and crisp crust, brought out a lighter side of the heavy combination that was already happening with the rich flavors of its predecessors.Which brings me to the main course...my favorite.  The Veal Saltimbocca!  Amazing...just plain amazing!  Let me start with the underlying addition of a Parmesan polenta.  Perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned.  The veal itself was covered in a rich, velvety marsala sauce accompanied by delicate mushrooms and prosciutto.  This dish is the type to make you lose your manners and lick the plate.  Yes, it's that good! Marcella's is a topnotch experience and will continue to get my patronage every time I'm in town.",Brian A.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,3/18/16,I'm always happy with this place.  The mushroom pizza add broccolini and chic parm are my go to choices.,Brian B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,4/17/15,"My husband and I have been here twice, the first time we took his mom for her birthday dinner, and the second time for happy hour. Wow, the happy hour is where it's at. All the appetizers and pizzas are half off, same with the cocktails and wines that are under $9 a glass. Such a great deal! My favorite things here are the arancini, melon and proscuitto, and melted pecorino, which they are unfortunately not able to serve right now due to the cheese being stuck in customs on its way from Italy! Hope it's available next time we return. The service has been fantastic both times we've been here. Very attentive and friendly, but not overcrowding. Can I just say, I feel so taken care of at a restaurant when a bathroom has free tampons? Nice touch. Also, mouthwash with cups; perfect for a post-garlicky meal rinse on date night.",Sarah N.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,9/13/16,"First time here. Traveling on business. Service is great and the food is even better! Calamari, beet salad and special request angel hair with bolognese. All was wonderful. And do try the Milan Manhattan.",Brian I.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2010/6/14,"Definitely a great place for a date night! Be sure to make reservations. As you could imagine, it gets packed on the weekend because it is a Cameron Mitchell restaurant and it's in the Short North. HIGHLY recommend the Chicken Parmesan! It is a relatively big portion (easy to split) and no other chicken parm compares! The Alfredo on the linguine tops it off with a creamy flavor. I've tried a couple of the other pasta dishes but I was always unimpressed which is why I'm not rating it any higher. Service has always been great and I love the atmosphere! It is loud and it definitely feels like you're right in the city. ALSO, they have their own valet which is about $5 I believe...easiest way to park for sure.",Brittney F.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2005/2/15,"One of my good friends took me here for a happy hour on Wednesday. Food and service was so good, my wife and I went back on Thursday! Definitely have to try the meatball, so delicious! Arancini is equally good! Had the potato pizza on the second trip and was impressed by that as well. Service was excellent the first day (sat at a table) slightly less so the second day (at the bar).",JT H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,8/17/14,"My favorite thing about this restaurant were the seemingly home-made ingredients, and that everything can be made to order and fully customized. The waiter was super-friendly and accommodating to our neurotic questions.  Every time we asked, ""Can we...?"" he said ""of course!"" Which we found quite encouraging. We ended up ordering a bottle of red wine that wasn't that great, though not terrible.  Next time we'd make a better selection. Then again, I don't like Italian wines in general, but I did like the traditional Italian wine glasses.  The custom pizza was very good, spicier than you would typically get from a pizza place when you ask them to make it 'very spicy,' and I loved the cast iron skillet used to keep our extra sauce warm.  Everyone inside seemed happy, and it was nice that it was open late. Will definitely go back.",Theron P.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,5/27/15,"A great place in Cbus--one of the more established short north restaurants.They set a standard for service (as one usually finds at a Cameron Mitchell) and fantastic wine. Mostly small plates, try the Sicilian pizza--you won't be sorry",Aimee K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2002/7/14,"This is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. I'm not a fan of the noisy atmosphere, but I don't even care when the food is this delicious. We usually get the four cheese pizza and the olives to start with. They're both wonderful. I had their beef carpaccio for the first time today and it was flawless - I can't wait to get it again. My husband is a fan of their meatballs. I love all the pasta I've ever gotten. Sadly I live about 3 hours away from Marcella's, but we make sure to hit it at least once every time we come to Columbus (I've been twice in the last three days this time around). You really want to eat here. Trust me!",Kay P.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2/24/15,"First more ""upscale"" restaurant I've been to since moving to Columbus.  Started with the veal meatball appetizer which was recommended.  Oh my stars was that thing tender.  Girlfriend and I split it and it was perfect.  For our main courses we ordered the Pasta Carbonara and the potato/parmesan pizza to split.  Why we decided to go with the heaviest and creamiest dishes, I'm not too sure.  Either way, both were fantastic and really sat us down.  The pasta was cooked perfectly the fresh cracked egg in the dish was a great touch.  Additionally to the food, the service was fantastic and the atmosphere is great.  Even though the weather was frigid, the restaurant was bustling and everyone was enjoying themselves.  Would 100% recommend to try!",Ned K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,1/31/16,This is the best Columbus can do for Italian? Maybe as mediocre as Martinis.  Had penne  arrabiata. I can make better sauce...from a jar. Rao's. You can get it at Target. Will not go back.,Mark T.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2001/11/16,"I'm huge fan of their happy hour selections for firsts! I've had the Chicken Parmesan (my favorite), Melted Pecorino Cheese and Calamari (appetizers), Fettucine and Meatball, and Pepperoni Pizza. The portion of all dishes are beautifully crafted and filling. The dining's lounge ambiance is perfect for a date night or group gathering.",Xiao M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,8/18/14,"After hearing great reviews, I was excited to go to Marcella's with my boyfriend for my birthday dinner. However, I was pretty disappointed by our experience.

Maybe we didn't try the right dish, but I'm not sure if we'll spend the money to go back again.",Abby B.,,,,,,

We had fettuccini  with a (very large!) meatball, Sicilian pizza, and an arancini appetizer. Everything was cooked to perfection.Cons:- The water was warm. It was a hot day outside, and I was looking to a tall glass of ice water. I was sorely disappointed. - The service was slow. However, we did go on a busy Friday night. - The restaurant felt cramped (barely enough room on the table for our food!), and it was quite loud.",Trevor H.,,,,,,

Solid pours of wine by the glass, from a decent offering of wines by the glass. My companion's lobster cannelloni was generous with the lobster, but a bit too generous with the salt. My gnocchi with a lamb (braised, plenty of it) ragu was impeccable. No time for dessert, alas.",steve w.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2008/4/15,My first experience at Marcellas was pretty good. I started with prosciutto.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,8/31/16,"The manager that was on duty the evening of August 30th definitely saved the night (also the reason I'm rating a 3 versus a 2). Things started off great. We could tell they were busy, but drinks and 2 of our 3 appetizers came pretty timely. Then 3 of our 5 entrees arrived. About 20 minutes went by and the other two still did not arrive. Our waiter did not check on us, so we finally called him over and explained we still had not received two of the entrees. He pretty much said, sorry, not my fault. Maybe I did not hear the whole conversation, but my jaw about hit the table. Someone else in our party went and got the manager and she apologized profusely. She put in our whole order again and everyone got their dishes again. She said, for those that had already received their entrees, we can package it up and have lunch for the next day. She also did not charge us for any of our entrees. I can appreciate that things get mixed up in the kitchen, but a little communication and follow up goes a long way.",A H.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2004/5/15,"I really love this place, especially in spring when their bar windows open up onto the sidewalk. I believe this was the first Cameron Mitchell place to open following his long hiatus after selling his concepts to Ruth Chris. He came back strong with this one. Since then, he's essentially taken over the entire block with the opening of The Pearl, The Guild House, and of course Martini's down the street. We dub this part of the Short North, ""Cameron Mitchell Row"" and haven't been disappointed with any of the new concepts.Food is solid and the drinks are very good but what I love about the place is the space itself and the vibe. The service is typical Cameron Mitchell Restaurants: friendly, efficient, sterile. It can be noisy so it's more of a hang out spot and it's great for people watching. Avoid coming on Gallery Hop, the wait times are ridiculous. We try to hit it during the week when it's more locals and more relaxed.",Rosie R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2011/3/15,"Absolutely amazing food. I was referred to this place by the hotel I was staying at and it certainly did not disappoint. I sat at the bar and was promptly greeted by both bartenders. I started with a beer and the melted pecorino cheese app. It was amazing! Served with thinly sliced apples, honey, bread, and the pecorino cheese. The cheese is served hot and in a small cast iron skillet. Moving on, I was told to order the Fettuccine meatball entree. It too was amazing. The meatball has an amazing flavor...kinda smoky, very soft, and cooked to perfection. I will certainly return when back in Columbus.",Tyler F.,,,,,,

It was busy, but we were quickly seated and quickly waited on. I got a glass of moscato which was delicious. I ordered the salmon with glazed carrots on a bed of arugula. I'm usually not a carrot fan but these were so sweet and tasty that I ate every single one. The salmon was moist and flaky. The arugula had a very light dressing on it, you couldn't even see it but the taste was divine. I was so pleased I literally ate every single morsel. My colleague ordered a pizza because he's a very picky eater! He said that it was great. He mentioned that it didn't have much sauce at all, which to him was a good thing. Definitely worth a trip. Oh, price wise, my salmon was $19 and his pizza was $13- definitely very reasonable prices!",T S.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,12/24/15,"Had a nice dinner with the wife on a busy Friday night.Happy Hour is definitely the time to make it here.We had the chance to try several apps the pecorino and apples was delicious and the calamari was good although the app was mostly zucchini.The pizza was meh,I'd much rather go to harvest.The atmosphere and service were both excellent.",Deterrion C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,10/30/14,"This place had such appeal and potential. My friends took us out here after we admitted a craving for Italian. It's their favorite place so we really were looking forward to it.The restaurant has that dark romantic atmosphere that would be perfect for a date night. We really enjoyed  the decor.For our first course we opted to skip the antipasto and settled on a ""drink course"". I had the Grapefruit Basil Fizz, a unique drink that combined these flavors into a wonderful treat for the tastebuds. The rest of the party enjoyed their drinks as well.For dinner my friends had the spaghetti and meatball (yes just one, but the thing is the size of your face!) and I went with the chicken marsala. We all enjoyed our meals, I personally am won over by an Italian restaurant that knows there is more to Italian cooking than just pasta, and served the chicken marsala with a side of polenta. My wife however did not fare so well in the food department. She ordered the Salmon, and it was burnt on the outside while still raw on the inside. She returned the meal and ordered a salad - the waitress was helpful in making a quick change so she wasn't stuck watching us eat.Overall the prices were reasonable for a quality Italian dinner date locale, but the execution was off on the meal.",Michael N.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2006/4/14,"With great service, delicious food and a comfortable atmosphere, Marcella's is well worth your time to visit if you find yourself in the Short North area of Columbus.The chicken parmesan I had was delicious and the Abita Amber beer made for a great accompanying beverage.  But as wonderful as the food was for a reasonable price, it was the service that really put it over the top.  Our server, Megan, was spot-on with her work, and the professionalism of the entire staff was impressive.  Even the gentleman who shredded cheese for our entrees did so in first-class form.Parking is not easy to come by in this area, but don't let that stop you from paying a visit to this wonderful restaurant. Highly recommended.",Lou P.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2008/7/16,"If you want fantastic food and are wiling to get hit or miss service, then stop by. I saw some of the waiters paying extra attention to their tables, while the waiter for our table disappeared for the majority of the dinner. The place was very crowded and loud when we went, so we didn't catch our waiter's name. He was African American and waited our table at the high seats right across from the bar.There was a short wait time before we were seated with reservations. Normally moments after being seated the waiter would normally stop by and get you drinks. No one came by for like 5-8 minutes. We were beginning to wonder if perhaps they had forgotten about us or if they were confused about which waiter was assigned to our tables. We were able to figure out what we wanted to eat and look up pictures of the dishes on Yelp in the time it took him to finally come by, and this usually takes awhile. He finally showed up and gave us some water and took our order. I had a chicken parm, my sister got a chicken piccata, and my mom got the tortellini. The food was fantastic and the portion size for the chicken parm was very filling. The tortellini on the other hand looked more like an appetizer. They gave maybe 5 tortellini? We also had some dessert, which was good. The food was great overall.The one thing that did ruin the experience for us was the terrible service, which quite possibly was the worst service I have ever had. We aren't demanding with our waiters. There are just some unspoken basic expectations that we all have. Even at places where I've had poor service the waiter at least fills our glasses with water without us having to ask.Throughout the entire dinner, we only had our glasses of water refilled once and this was because we had to ask despite him walking by several times. They had accidentally given us 4 glasses of water instead of 3 because they gave us an extra menu. I finished my water and waited for a refill, which never came. So I took the extra glass and it was less than half full when he walked by and looked at our table. I thought he was going to refill our glasses, but he didn't and  so I had to flag him down and ask him. We honestly spent more time sitting there waiting on our waiter than anything. It took him over 20 minutes to come over after we finished our entrees and he didn't even offer a dessert menu. I had to ask. Then it took him 5-8 minutes to bring the dessert menu and 8-10 more to take our dessert order. Then it took 15 minutes for our order to be brought out and at this point, we were tempted to just walk our then and have them keep the dessert. We were there for almost 2 hours and all of it was us waiting for service. A couple that had come in after us and were waiting for a table left an hour before us. They were seated across the divider where they had a very attentive waiter who was always running around with a bottle of water.The one thing that came out the fastest was the bill.",Becky R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,4/27/14,"Decided to visit Short North while here for a wrestling tournament. It was a Saturday evening and everything was PACKED and we had no reservations. The windows were open and the great smell of garlic and olive oil was too much to pass up. We approached the hostess and was told the wait would be at least an hour and a half... but we were hungry and decided to find a spot at the bar and wait. Let me just say every single server we encountered was incredibly  friendly and accommodating. And for a restaurant that was literally packed out the doors the service was quick and the food was fresh and hot. We got the fried risotto as an appetizer. It was delicious and piping hot.. very delicate flavors for a fried food.. tasty and cooked perfectly. My wife got the tortellini with braised beef and it was unbelievable.. again very  subtle flavoring but perfect... Not over seasoned or a salt lick like some places. My son and I both got the pizza, the pepperoni pizza was excellent with red onion and fresh garlic. The pizza sauce was great and flavorful with a hint of sweetness. It accentuated the pepperoni perfectly. My son had the 3 meat pizza and it was just as flavorful.I also want to mention how amazing the bartenders were. Since we never got our seats we ended up ordering at the bar.. and as you know, on a busy Saturday night the last thing bartenders have time for is full dinner service. Not once did we get the feeling that we were putting them out or annoying them. Even making sure my son's Shirley Temple stayed full, and taking the time to listen when my 12 year old requested something. At the end of the evening they even went so far as to comp us a delicious Tiramisu because of our wait.The next time we are in the area we WILL be back! Thanks again. Try the Tuscan Limonata.",Tyler H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,5/18/14,"A few of the girls and I made reservations for last night to kick off my friends bachelorette party... This is her favorite restaurant and I can see why! Although we had a reservation, we still had to wait about 20 minutes for a table which was annoying; they felt bad though and brought 2 appetizers to our table on the house.  Each one was incredible! We had the meatball which was packed with flavor and melted in your mouth. Hands down best meatball I've ever eaten. We also got the cheese and crustini, and the cheese was gooey and perfect. There was a truffle honey dipping sauce next to the cheese and we dipped the apple slices in it (delish!) For my entree, I got the risotto. It changes with the fresh ingredients available at the time, and yesterday's was chicken and artichoke.  It was perfectly cooked and the flavors were exquisite... I would definitely order it again.  This was the perfect start to our night out!",Kaity K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2011/12/15,"My husband and I went here on a whim during the week and loved it. We are new to Columbus and have been working our way around the Short North to try all of the restaurants. We enjoyed wine, pasta, delicious bread and a great atmosphere. What we ordered: Lamb Meatball - one of the best things I have ever tastedLinguine & Clams - fresh, fresh ingredients and a light dish that hits it homeVeal Limone -  Large portion and cooked perfectly Wine - yes. it's great. it comes in the traditional carafe style.This place would receive five stars if their bar drinks were better. The signature mixed drinks were very sugary & not matched the how great everything else is.",Jessica S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2011/9/14,I always have a great time here! They have an excellent happy hour and my favorite dish is the lamb gnocchi con bolognese. You won't be disappointed! The whiskey rosso is a fine cocktail as well.,Ashley A.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2007/11/16,"Not a bad plate came to our table. Jordan was very helpful. We have teenage kids and he helped make the experience fun. We ordered lots of different items and shared them. I had never done Italian tapas, but it was a great idea. Tortellini, the meatball, and the cannoli were our favorites. Service and timing were spot on. Short North area is a fun area to walk around before or after.",Mike Z.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,7/31/16,"Wow! This is the best Italian I've had. We started with the melted pecorino app and prosciutto. Kind of made little sandwiches of honey, crisp apple, prosciutto and cheese. Delicious! I had the linguini and meatball. The meatballs just melt in your mouth and are falling apart. They're so yummy. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parm and a side of carbonara. OMG! The carbonara was the best pasta I've ever had. The chicken parm was a good size portion and tasty too. Too bad we don't live in Columbus because a lot of my money would be spent here lol",Tiffany T.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,10/20/14,"Went here for my birthday dinner and it was a great choice!We ordered the meatball and sausage appetizers and wow, that meatball was probably the best meatball I've ever had. The sausage was cooked perfectly and surrounded by veggies that were absolutely delicious. We also ordered a cheese platter of 3 cheeses. Somehow our order got mixed up and the server was not only apologetic but immediately brought out the correct cheeses while letting us keep and try the other cheeses we hadn't ordered. Finally, for dinner everyone ordered an entree and was very pleased. I don't think you can go wrong at Marcella's! Everything we had was delicious. Finally, when checking my ID for our bottle of wine the server realized it was my birthday and offered me an on the house dessert to finish off the meal. I ordered and shared the Tiramisu with my group and it was perfect. I will definitely be going back to Marcella's again soon!",Kerri K.,,,,,,

Margarita is a favorite.Parking can be an issue but valet is available for $5.Ambience is perfect for dates or groups. It can be very loud.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,7/28/15,"If you do not read any other review read this one - order the fettuccine and meatball and you will not be disappointed. This is the single greatest meal I have had in Columbus and I have had it over 50 times. Their meatball makes those who live in Boston, and go to the north end, dream about the meatball. One of my co-workers planned a visit to Columbus around having a meal here.",Michael W.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,1/15/13,"Though this was my first time at Marcella's, I have long been a fan of Cameron Mitchell restaurants.  Arriving with two friends to Marcella's, we quickly observed a nice ambiance where we could hear each other and enjoy each other's company over good food.  We arrived around 4:15 PM for an early dinner during Happy Hour (Mondays through Fridays from 4-6 PM).  In fact, the Happy Hour specials will be tough to beat as all of the small plates, appetizers, salads, pizzas, and many of the drinks were all half price.  We ordered two pizzas and a salad for the three of us to split and the final bill was only about $15 total.  Amazing!!The food itself is definitely worth mentioning.  Even the bread had its own unique taste, especially when dipped in olive oil or balsamic sauce.  The salad was presented very well and my friends both enjoyed the beet salad.  We ordered first one ""classic"" pizza that was the Crispy Potato, half of which had pancetta.  The second ""classic"" pizza was the Margherita D.O.C. pizza.  While we ordered one to be with whole wheat crust, we made the mistake of not clarifying that we really wanted both to be with whole wheat.  It turned out delicious (and very filling) nonetheless.  In fact, we could have gotten away with a filling meal with only one pizza and one salad to split for the three of us.  Another great restaurant with some fabulous deals!",Cory S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,9/19/15,"My friends and I have been coming to this place for the past few years for random happy hours.  Absolutely love their appetizers here. Would highly recommend the meatball here as it just melts in your mouth.  The pecorino fondue might seem somewhat intimidating at first, but it is absolutely delicious, just try to eat it while the cheese is still melted.",Alice J.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2007/9/15,"Came tonight for happy hour, at the bar we got drinks and waited for a table. I got the citro fresca, it was margarita like but not as mind numbingly sugary. Quite good, and a generous portion too. My friend got the whiskey rosso, let me tell you that tasted like sweet sweet candy juice! I'd definitely recommend that and will be getting it next time!We only had to wait 10 minutes before being switched to a table. Where we promptly ordered our meals to share. We got the fondue, which is amazing, if you have more than three people consider ordering two, everyone will love these!!!! So gooey and mild and perfect. We got the beef carpaccio, which was lovely and tasted like a rare salty steak. There were only two ricotta cakes underneath, which felt like a bit of a jip there. But the salad underneath was great. I did expect the carpaccio to have a preserved quality (which is what I've had at other restaurants), but it was really just thin sliced raw steak, very good but different than I expected. We ordered the pesto goat cheese shrimp pizza, this was amazing! Not overwhelming in the least and the goat cheese is just the perfect addition! You'll regret not getting this. Also the beet salad; very good! Great healthy option that's tasty enough to not make you jealous of everyone else. Our food allergic friend had the sun choke salad and seemed to like it but I can't report much on that. The waitress kept our water glasses suspiciously full and service was great. Be sure to check out the powder soap in the bathrooms, really fun touch!!I'll definitely be back!",Jessica P.,,,,,,

As New Yorkers we're a little snobbish about food and restaurants, and did't want to eat at one of the many chain restaurants near campus. Marcella's was recommended to us and it was awesome. Great atmosphere, great food and pleasant staff. The drinks were a little slow but we compensated by ordering two at a time. Small tapas plates and largest ones too and everything was great. Try the onions with melted parm cheese and the meatball, calamari, fresh prosciutto and cheese - all great.",J T.,,,,,,

I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have a great Italian meal and great drinks!",Christian J.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,3/30/14,"This is definitely the number one Italian restaurant in Ohio. I've only had better food one place ever in my life and that was in NYC. The meatballs here are probably the best thing that I have ever tasted in my LIFE! The are super tender, moist, and flavorful. They are also gigantic and almost a meal in themselves. I would also highly recommend the chicken parmesean, though the alfredo spaghetti with it was lacking flavor. That's ok because the rest of the food definitely makes up for it! The chicken piccata was pretty tasty as well. All of the staff were so helpful and nice too. I would recommend this restaurant HIGHLY!!!",Sarah S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,11/15/12,"I absolutely loooove this place! It's always my go to place, when I can't think of a place to go. I am always in the mood for their food and everything I have had out of the 4 or 5 times I have been there, has been amazing.I recommend the Melted Pecornio Cheese and the Arincini for appetizers. As for their dinner entrees, I can always go with any of their pizzas, but the Gnocchi Bolognese is  an awesome meal! If you don't want something heavy, I would stay away from it.Marcella's is a great place for friends and groups as well as a great place for a date! The ambiance is the exact definition of the Short North. They also have another location up North by the Polaris Mall.",Kathryn W.,,,,,,

Happy hour is 4-6, and all cocktails and beers on tap are half off. Small plates, salads, and pizzas are half off too. We shared the crispy potato pizza which was excellent!  The drinks were very refreshing and good.  I had two sangrias which were delish and she ordered a martini that she enjoyed too.  The appetizer we ordered was arancini which was also good.   The price is right too, a lot of  restaurants in the Short North are way over priced but not here.  Great place to bring a date.  Check this place out, you won't be disappointed.",Jen J.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,4/19/15,"Highly disappointed!!!Marcellas puts more effort into trying to remind you of Italy with decor, than making quality Italian dishes. Marinara sauce was bland and tasted like store bought and the pasta was slightly over cooked. Tortellini alla manzo was too salty for my liking. Had three hostesses that were busier gossiping than sitting tables; making the floor manager focus on seating. Why have a shirt that say ""All about the gnocchi"" when you only offer one dish with gnocchi?",Ross R.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2010/8/12,"After living in Columbus for over 4 years, I hadn't been to the famous Marcella's! A friend was visiting from out of town so I decided we should have dinner there and both experience it. Honestly, I was a little disappointed. Oh, it was good enough. It was fine. I didn't dislike my meal at all. But it didn't live up to the hype I'd always heard.We had a prosciutto and melon appetizer which was interesting. I had the Fettuccine and Meatball - because, you know, the giant meatball is supposed to be a thing. It was good, but not particularly special. My friend got the gnocchi, which was also one of the things we heard raved about. I think she liked it, but was not blown away either.Anyhow. Now I guess I can say I ate there. I might end up here again, which would be fine. But, you, I might just move on too.",Kayre H.,,,,,,

The zucchini is cut supper thing and deep fried. It is covered with shaved parmesan cheese. For an entree I choose the braised lamb and gnocchi. This had some nice rich flavors and was a nice departure from your traditional tomato sauce and gnocchi dishes I have had.  It was a great dinner and I am looking forward to going back and trying their popular meatball pasta.",Ken I.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,8/17/12,"Love, love, love Marcella's. The atmosphere is great for cozying up with the boyfriend or a small group of pals and sharing rounds of small plates, carafes of wine and that feeling that I never want to leave. This may be an odd thing to review, but Marcella's has, by far, the best olive oil I've tasted in Columbus. Served with a loaf of crusty bread to start your meal, it's a perfect amount of rich and fruity. Add a little s+p and I'm in heaven. I've never had any of the pasta or main dishes, but have found my go-to order is Marinated Olives (served warm in a little cast-iron pot), the Arancini/Risotto Balls (served with the best marinara ever), the Escarole & Sunchoke salad (a perfect way to cut through the rich, saltiness of everything else) and a pizza (I usually go with the Sicilian.

Everything else about the pizza was good though. Love their crust.Potato pizza - mmmm, so good. I forgot what was on it exactly, a white cheese, arugula, and potato chips. Loved everything about it.Zucchini - super oily. Super thin slices of zucchini deep fried and then sprinkled with parmesean.Bruschetta - great, big slices of mozzarella.Veal Meatballs - it's one meatball, but it's one BIG meatball. It's well seasoned & tender. Onion - SUPPPPER oily. Onion slices baker/roasted in the oven and then covered in an oil/parmesean spread or something.Service is pretty decent. They give you bread to start off with. For two people, we only got 3 slices despite the shelves of bread they had. I asked for more but never got it. Other than the apparent stinginess with their bread, the service was fine.Everything there is pretty oily, but it's tasty if you wipe a lot of it off. It's a lot of food, and we took a bunch home.

Comes with honey which you should liberally spread on your bread before topping it off with the cheese and maybe a drizzle of olive oil if you please. I personally like the gorgonzola the best3. Tried the proscuitto. You really can't go wrong with that. 4. I don't remember the salads well, except that it was great in between my devouring of cheese5. Pizza was good, not exceptional. We had the veggie pizza and it had a good number of different veggies. Granted, we were pretty stuffed at this point because all the other dishes came out already.6. half off wine that are priced under 9 dollars/glass. Whazzza7. We had 3 baskets of bread8. I'm probably going to make time to go again this week.9. Yum Toasted bread with the marinara sauce. The bruchetta was so so so good. Soft, but crispy baguette, but tangly but sweet marinara sauce/tomato goodness on top. I think there were other things on the bruchetta but the main characters out shined everyone else.Bottom line? Grab you friends/acquantainces/family/strangers and come here for happy hour. Best would be a group of 4-5 because you can split the dishes reasonably (you only get 5 bruchetta, so don't invite so many people or else you'll have to fight for them)",Serena H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2011/11/11,"Marcella's is a fun place with a variety of good food on their menu.  The little touches like mismatched small plates for sharing on the table are great.  Grandma loves it when we take her to dinner here, as she says it makes her feel ""just like [she's] back home"" (Europe).The specials like Happy Hour (small plates, appetizers, salads, pizzas, and a lot of drinks half price) and Sunday Night Dinner (salad, spaghetti & meatball plus dessert for one price) are our favorites - we go early so we haven't had a problem with wait or crowds (although it does start to get crowded as the evening wears on -- which also makes it quite a bit louder).Key food notes from our favorites: the meatball is HUGE.  You don't get spaghetti and meatballs, you get spaghetti and a giant meatball of goodness.  The tiramisu is delicious and comes in a large piece that is easy to share... or not!  There are some interesting and delicious combos of toppings for the pizzas.  The parmesan crusted onions are delicious - warm and flavorful - and the calamari is tender and comes with wonderful additions like zucchini, lemon slices, marinara sauce and roasted garlic aioli.There is a very nice selection available on the gluten-free menu - most of the pizzas and pastas are available with gluten free crust and pasta.  The server explained that they use different colored notepads to record the gluten free orders, which the chefs than initial as the work on the food in the kitchen in order to track the gluten free orders.  The gluten free bread provided at the beginning of the meal is delicious - love the use of herbs on top.Fun place with good food!",Marissa C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,5/15/16,"Had a great time and meal with my friend here. We are from Detroit. It was recommended by the hotel.  If you are looking for quiet/intimate, this is not the place. Pretty noisy but that was not an issue for us.  Highly recommended.",Maureen G.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,7/27/15,"Stumbled across this place about 5 years ago wen we were looking to did something new and it has since been one of our favorites! Great wine list and cheese boards! We have heard the fondue is amazing as well, but have yet to try it.  Split a pizza if your looking for a cheap date or order any of there entrÌ©es for something more. For dessert you must get the profiteroles!",Kaitlin H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,8/22/13,"Easily one of the best Italian restaurants that I have ever been too.First- try to go before it gets too crowded.Second- Check our their wine selection. Starting with some of their dry meats and cheeses might be a good idea! Third- Order yourself a full entree! I had the lamb gnocci, and it was unbelievable. Portion sizes are also pretty large.Last- Can't go wrong with some tiramisu.On a side note, Marcella's is in a great location so stopping for dinner and walking around Short North makes for a perfect date night.",Devika A.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,4/19/16,"Awesome vibe and phenomenal happy hour specials on food during the week. Try the margherita pizza, meatball and calamari for half price!",Allen M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,2001/9/15,"Went here for one of my best friend's 30th birthday. We made reservations for 7:30 pm on a Friday night. Arrived there shortly before 7:30 and had to wait about 15-20 minutes to be seated. Then we were put at a small round table in the corner by the bar. Clearly they had either forgotten about our reservation or didn't care, though we had put on the reservation that we were there for a birthday. Luckily we were planning on sharing food because there would not have been enough room for all three of us to have our own entrees. Food was okay, but nothing special for the price. Our server was great, but other than that I'm not sure I would return here for more than some wine at the bar.",Ariana E.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2006/10/15,I loved everything about this place. I was thrilled to hear they had happy hour specials. Their drinks were delicious and the pizzas were a perfect pair to go with the drinks. The bar staff was friendly and quick with our orders. I will be back whenever I'm in Columbus!,Krista W.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,1,12/21/15,"I've been twice, the first time was good. A bit overpriced but good food so I handle it. My second time, I went for happy hour with my girlfriend and another couple. I had a so-so experience. We were told the happy hour specials, which included the beers being half off. Our table asked what the seasonal beer was and the server said Mad Elf from Troegs. At no point did he mention that this beer was NOT half off because it was a higher alcohol content and served in a snifter. When the bill came, we realized that we did not in fact receive the happy hour price on those beers. When we questioned the server he mentioned the above reasons for why the beer wasn't apart of the happy hour deal. How was the situation rectified, well it wasn't because the table paid full price for those beers. TIP! Make sure to ask your server specifically which items are included in the happy hour offerings, that way you don't find out when you get the check! Also, it's kind of sad for a restaurant to only offer two draught beers, one being Stella (which was half off), the other being Mad Elf (not half off), and then saying beers are half off. Not a pleasant experience.",Jonathan L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,11/23/14,"I like this location better than the Polaris one.  The food and service has always been very good when I have eaten here.  I love there Calamari.  The pastas are tasty, and love there meatball!  My favorite thing to order when I come- Its so big and very filling.  The Eggplant was delicious as well.  One of my fave spots for Italian in Columbus.  Its such a competitive market in the Short North, but Marcella's stands out.",Todd G.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,10/23/14,"This is my favorite happy hour in the Bus! When I make plans for dinner here, I struggle to focus on work the whole afternoon. As I sit at my computer, I try to void the thoughts of the savory 4 cheese pizza and those 3 plumply-soaked gorgonzola stuffed olives in my cold and extra dirty martini. Maybe I'll go back tonight.",Megan S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2009/8/14,"Literally the best happy hour in town. Go from 4 to 6 and their menu is almost exclusively half off! For dishes consisting of beef carpaccio, smoked meats, awesome pizza and fine Italian wines to complement; the regular menu prices are a good deal. I'm not sure how they make money serving these items at half off but I don't care. it's delicious and you can enjoy a 4 course meal with wine for 25 dollars; enough said.",Adrian V.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,3/16/15,"Visited on a Thursday night at 8pm with a reservation for a party of ten and were seated immediately.  Inside ambiance is quite noisy, so be prepared to lean into the conversation or wear discreet foam earplugs.  Ordered a  variety of dishes.  The appetizer of fried calamari was just okay and we have learned over time that America's Heartland maybe isn't the best place for coastal seafood.  Online reviews often mentioned the giant meatball, which was ordered with fettucini (comes red and white sauce, the pasta dressed in white and the meatball red).  The meatball was disappointing. Mushy, undercooked and lacked the requisite crust that a proper hot oven provides. The fettucini was a delightful surprise, light as a feather and not drowned in alfredo (which was a light cream sauce).  We also give high marks to the baker both for the high quality pizza crusts (recommend the Sicilian Pizza) and the outstanding baked bread provided during the appetizer and salad courses.  The dessert menu best choice is the Profiteroles (cream puffs) with ice cream and sauces.We were pleased with wine list and the prompt attentive table service. Another plus is the restroom where complimentary mouthwash is provided to neutralize any garlic you don't want to share with your date. If Marcella's was a boxing match, we would call it a split decision.",Ham R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,2012/4/15,"First of all, it kind of pains me to write this review.  I have to clarify that this review reflects the service and not the food.  The food is 4-5 star and has ALWAYS been consistent and delicious.  Whenever I have guests in from out of town, I take them to Marcellas's without fail.  The best meatball in town, best bruschetta, and an AWESOME happy hour.  One of my favorites, if not my favorite in the Short North.  Now for the part that has been stuck in my craw for quite some time.  There is a bartender that has been there for years and she is absolutely dreadful and RUDE.  Her friends usually sit at the far end of the bar in the back and you can tell she loves them, but is just nasty to other patrons.  She acts like we are lucky that she is gracing us with her serving skills.  She made two smart a*s comments to myself and my other two guests and this is not the first time she has been this way.  All of the other bar tenders are great!  It is really sad.  I don't know if she thinks that she is entitled because she has been there for so long or what?  This has happened to us on at least five occasions and we are by no means lousy tippers.  So this review reflects her attitude and not the food, dÌ©cor, ambiance, menu, etc.  Worst review I have ever written.  Go here and sit at a table!",Sean S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2005/2/15,"I truly enjoyed my first experience at Marcella's. This is a very classy, but casual restaurant with top-of-the-line Italian meals. I was impressed with the unique way they serve wine, and it's not from a typical wine glass. They serve it in a mini-carafe that you pour into another small glass. The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable if you need suggestions. And there's also many friendly regular's at the bar who can help you pick a good meal when it's busy. I tried the linguini with clams and was impressed with the quality of this meal and the way it was presented with delicious Italian bread. Plain and simple, if you want to pig out on Italian food around the Short North/Arena District, go to Buca. But if you want to enjoy a classy Italian meal with a great crown, go to Marcella's.",Scott V.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,11/21/13,"Marcella's is so solid. The place itself is really lovely, the service is always good, and their specials are so worth checking out -- Sunday evenings are full of specials. I think their half-off bottles of wine thing is now 25% off wine, but still, since you can always get wine by the half-bottle there, really it's never a bad deal. And in spite of the fancy ambiance, which often scares me off from places (as I am somewhere between a cheapskate and a food snob and I hate paying a lot for food I can make at home), Marcella's is really not too pricey for the experience they provide. But here's the kicker for me: Marcella's has a gluten free menu that almost exactly matches the regular menu! I'm not kidding -- you can get almost anything gluten free! They will even bring you gluten-free bread & oil before your meal -- how cool is that??  LOVE.",Alexa A.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,10/31/11,"Mamma mia! (Not the ABBA song & movie, the actual cliche phrase uttered by people like me that know about 12 Italian words.)This place was great! A swanky red couch right inside the door beckoned me to sit in it and look debonair. (I failed.) We were quickly seated and the hostess even walked me to the bathroom when I asked for directions. Great customer service. And speaking of customer service, our server Brandon was on top of things the whole meal. He was there with a water refill before I even realized. I appreciate that. Onto the food. Holy cow; the Braised Veal Meatball ($7) is o-mazing! Now, it is veal, so I consumed with a guilty conscience, but dang it was really really good. You can also get this meatball with some of the pasta dishes. We divided it by 4 and it was a nice appetizer.The next scrumptious dish was the Melted Pecorino Cheese app ($10). It contains Crostini (toast), Apple slices, and Truffle Honey. This killer combo is fantastic and also a good app to share. The only bump in the meal was our Cheese Plate. The first time it was brought to us, one of the cheeses was wrong. No biggie, but anytime my cheese addiction is delayed, I start to unravel. Another problem was the cheese pieces were too small. Oh well, I don't need the extra calories. Skip the aged provolone, it was rather flavorless.Our party also ordered the Pesto Shrimp Pizza ($13). It has roasted tomato and goat cheese. They said it was awesome. I looked at it with ""Hungry Eyes"" (quick go watch the video: http://youtu.be/rI4fzajz3Ok ). I might have too get it the next time I eat here.We washed all this delicious food down with a bottle of the Citrus White Sangria. It's a fruity and light drink that hit the spot. Fortunately we were here during early dinner time, as I could see this place getting real busy in the later hours. Definitely get reservations if your party is large or your dinnertime needs to be specific.",John B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,7/14/13,"I was in town for a 10-day work trip at the nearby convention center.  We ate at Marcella's for the last two nights.  I wish I knew about it earlier.  Very child-friendly.Great food, but even GREATER service by their staff.  There was a miscommunication about the order from our end (not the server's fault!) and the server was absolutely cool about it, and immediately fixed the situation for us.  After a long, stressful day for us, this was a great evening spot.We immediately made a reservation for 8 for the following night!  Thank you, we will be back!",Jay C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2004/11/16,"This restaurant is an absolute gem. I was looking for a vibrant, but romantic spot to take my boyfriend to dinner for his birthday. He loves Italian food and it takes A LOT of food to fill him up, but this place did the job. We got fried calamari to start (it also came with fried zucchini which I thought was an awesome little bonus) with mixed drinks from the cocktail menu and they were very tasty. He got a pizza for his meal, with shrimp on it and it was delicious. I got the gnocchi de bolognes and it was amazing! I love gnocchi and had been craving it and this dish hit the spot. I highly recommend this restaurant. One little note, however, is that it doesnt seem like there is a ton of room for big groups.. it seemed the restaurant was fit more for groups of 4 or 2.",J P.,,,,,,

I was in town for work and a dear friend (and local) chose Marcella's for dinner. - Great location in Short North (if you're a visitor, spend some time in this area)- Yum cocktails, decent wine list, would like to see some more beer choices, though- Potato pizza is a WIN - super fresh, homemade potato ""chips"" on top -- also has some hints of truffle - but his may have been the wishful thinking of my tastebuds- Lasagna, in my opinion, leaves a lot to be desiredI think this is a good spot for a big group dinner -- the atmosphere is very fitting.  Also the place if you need a date spot that isn't so quiet/calm it breeds awkwardness.",Mark M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,10/23/14,"If you want a quality Italian dinner, this is the place.  Certainly has the american flare, but great quality and good tasting food.  Highly recommend the bruschetta and any of the flat breads, but the pasta is great as well. Decent bar but lacking on draft selection and short on craft beers.  Specialty martini's are on point and poured well by the very sharp bartenders.",Tyler S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2/27/13,"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Columbus. First, the atmosphere is great. The restaurant is always bustling without feeling 'busy' Part of the credit has to go to the staff who always seem chill and willing to answer questions about the menu. They never make you feel rushed, even though I'm sure people are waiting for my table that I may just be relaxing at after finishing dinner. The food is also very very good. Is it 5-star fancy italian? no. If I have to nitpick, it always bothers me they use canned tomatoes on pizzas, but it doesn't strike me as a huge deal. If you go, definitely order the fried mozzarella balls. Order them! Thank me later! Their selection of house original pizzas are great. I try a new one every time I go and have yet to be disappointed. One of my favorites is the margharita pizza and the four-cheese pizza. Both are fantastic. WINE! They have the customer friendly way to order wine I have ever seen. You can order wine by the glass - 1/4 bottle, 1/2 bottle, or of course, full bottle. The awesome part is there is no savings by ordering a bigger amount. (i.e. two 1/2 bottles cost the same as 1 full bottle). So you don't have to worry about ordering too much just in case you drink a lot. If you have the opportunity to check this place out in the summer, it's spectacular. They open up the walls (hard to explain) to make the front of the house a virtual indoor patio where you can eat and look out on the short north district. this is one of my favorite places to go on a date and i see it being a favorite restaurant of mine for a long time.",Joe G.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,1/23/13,"I'm sorry, I'm just not on the Marcella's bandwagon. The Polaris location is light years better than Short North. I'll compare the two and you can deduct your own thoughts:- SN: no patio  - SN: abbreviated HH specials (by an hour!)- SN: less expansive menu (even the menu is different? Hrmph.)- SN: the place to be seen vs. the place to be/hang/enjoy/chill- SN: the high-boy tables in the bar area don't have hooks and the chairs are round-backed; hello, bags/purses. Accommodate your clientele! I know it's always chock full, especially on weekend evenings, but I'd seek out many of the other, superior options in the Short North. There are plenty where you'll find a more pleasant experience!",Janelle S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2006/10/13,"I came here with my parents and sister before driving back to Cleveland this weekend.

I got the veal meatball for an app and needless to say, the entire table loved it.  My dad and sister also enjoyed the sausage app.I ordered the Penne Alla Arrabiatta for dinner and holy spiciness.  It was good, but will definitely be lasting me a few meals.

We were excited to show them one of our favorite spots downtown but were also nervous about how they'd like it. We sit down and my dad says, ""I thought you said there was eggplant parm on the menu? I'm not seeing that."" So we ask our waitress about it, and she says that we must be thinking about the Polaris menu, and that they don't serve eggplant parm at the Short North location anymore. ""But,"" she says, ""I can ask the chef if he's got all the ingredients in the back and he can probably prepare it for you."" My dad was ecstatic, and that's exactly what they did. He and my mom began raving to our waitress how amazing it was, so she says ""I can try and see if our chef can print out the recipe for you."" The next thing we know, the manager is coming over with a recipe for chicken parm (because they don't have eggplant parm in house, so she explained to swap the eggplant for chicken) and walks my parents through the ingredients, how to get the breading extra crispy, etc. We were blown away!!!

If you get there early enough, you can get a seat by the window, which in the summer opens up the full length of the wall letting the breeze seep through the building.  During the happy hour all appetizers, salads, pizzas, meats, cheeses, olives, cocktails and most wines are half off (essentially, 2/3 of the menu is half off).  Foods I would definitely recommend: the veal meatball, potato pizza, parma prosciutto bruschetta and if you miss happy hour the chicken parm is excellent.  Their specials are always worth consideration and are typically delicious, though I would shy away from the ravioli as you don't get much.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2004/3/13,"Over the past two visits I had made to Marcella's, I have really started to form a feeling of attachment to it, much like Cap City (although certainly not to the same extent). Both times I went here were for celebrations, one intimate and one social, and both were very enjoyable, with the restaurant making a nice contribution to the experience.Depending on what time of the time one is walking in, the atmosphere will change with it. If one comes during the day, because of the large windows in front of the restaurant, there is a lot of natural light, and provides a very comfortable, lively feeling. At night, the lights are dimmed and small candles are lit at every table, making it very romantic. Tying everything in is the decor, which is excellently done, and not pretentious at all. I should also mention that Marcella's has the most uniquely designed menus I have seen at any restaurant, and is my favorite to look at.The food is of course up to par, and fortunately enough, I was able to experience a handful of dishes between the two visits. My favorite was on the first, when I had the Veggie Pizza, which is simply one of the nicest pizzas I have ever had. It certainly did not skimp out on the greens, and humorously enough had a pile of greens of almost salad proportions, but it was deliciously done. On the second visit, I was able to try the Calabrese Potatoes, the Beef Carpaccio, the Veal Braised Meatball, and the Chicken Giardiniera. In sum, the potatoes were tangy and delicious, the carpaccio made me realize that I did not like the texture of raw meat (although the flavor was enjoyable), the meatball was alright, and the chicken was excellently done, reminiscent of something my Italian grandfather would make.When combined with reasonable prices and polite, attentive staff, it certainly is a restaurant to try out, and I know I shall be returning when the occasion presents itself.",Nicholas E.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2007/7/11,"While you can complain about Marcella's just being another part of the corporate Cameron Mitchell machine, you gotta' admit, they do a great job with most of their restaurants. And Marcella's was no exception.The location is great and fits the neighborhood well. We started off with the cheese and olives. I loved the variety of cheeses.  I'm not a huge fan of olives but they were okay. Better than the ones at Barcelona in GV but not something I would order again. However the shining star was the veal meatball. Put all your politically correct BS away and order this ball of pure baby cow heaven. Served in its own little ""crock pot"", the amazing flavor will stay with you forever.  I swear I have dreams about it to this day.  We completed our dinner with pepperoni pizza and the Sicilian pizza.  Both were very good.Marcella's will definitely be on my list next time I'm back in Columbus.",Steve S.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2009/7/10,"Food: 3 stars.The Italian tapas idea is pretty unique, the menu is appealing, but overall the taste / execution and plating overall is just ok.

Nice choice whether for a date night, a group outing or a business meal. Service: 4 stars.Our server was friendly and food came out efficiently.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2011/12/13,"We came here first because we got bumped on our flight back to NY. Now we purposely schedule flights so we can come here. The food is outstanding. Start with rustic olives and cheeses and cured Italian meats, prepared expertly. Slide into inventive appetizers--the meatball is its own food group, as are the risotto balls. Our tables main courses--ranging from a chopped salad to veal to the special of the day apple & chicken risotto to pastas were uniformly superb.To top it off, the service is professional, warm & friendly; these people care about their jobs and your meal.My only suggestion is to please not go when we are in town--I don't want to be shut out because they're fully booked!!",Tony I.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2007/6/14,"Best Italian in the 614; hands down. The meatballs will literally melt in your mouth. The pasta is great, the pizza is awesome. A fun place to split apps with a group of people.",Jenny D.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2010/4/10,"I'm pretty sure the secret to Marcella's is simple food done well. I went to Marcella's on a Friday night with a large party. They had us in the far back at a long banquette style table. I was so surprised how extremely busy it was on a Friday at 6:30PM. It must have been everyone jamming in for the happy hour of half price pizzas and discount drinkies. Being that it was so busy, it was very loud in there. Again, the decor was not my style and the tables were super crowded with the pizza holders and plates and olive oil decanters everywhere. They really have the tables set up so they can cram as many people as possible that restaurant. We were seated right in front of these display cases that sort of mask the floor of the kitchen and waiter station. The display cases were kind of gross as they had a bunch of old veggies in there. Get somebody one that, please! Very Unappetizing. With all that said, our server was pretty good. Plus 1 for being extremely good looking and a good sport with our group. He did OK with refills and drinks at first but slacked off as the nite went on. Overall, efficient enough for a large party. Again, the food impresses. I had the caprese salad (simply prepared) the tomatoes were fresh and flavorful and there was plenty of mozzarella, but not enough basil. Maybe only two or three shreds for the whole thing. I got over it. I also ordered the Crispy potato pizza, which was fantastic. The cheese, onions, and pancetta were perfect with the fresh lemon olive oil tossed arugula and potato crisps. Definitely a win! They did a cake service for us at no extra charge. How sweet! I walked away paying $21 for food + generous tip. I would definitely return if I walked by during happy hour and they weren't slammed. If that ever happens.",Liz M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,7/14/13,"Marcella's has a lot going for it.  Nice vibe, really good appetizers, and great service.   It also specializes in handling large groups and so is a place to keep in mind if you are looking to have a party of some sort, whether it be a birthday or bachelorette event.  However, if doing so, I suggest reservations and arriving more or less on time since the waiting area is a bit cramped.It was Saturday night when I went, and like probably half the people in the place, it was as a member of a large group.  Not all of our members arrived on time and our table wasn't quite available when the first of us entered, so about six of us ended up waiting.  Originally we stood near the hostess stand in the designated waiting area (which has a very awesome looking couch) but found that we were impeding the entry of other patrons, so we instead squeezed in around the bar.  Or rather, since the bar was full, squished into a tight little circle between the full tables near the bar.  The other people there didn't seem to mind but it did feel a bit claustrophobic to me.    We didn't have to wait too long, though, and soon were seated at a long set of square tables.  Hearing wasn't too bad for me since I was seated in the dead center, but it wasn't easy for the person at one end to hear what someone at the other said. Even after being seated, a few members of our party had not arrived, so we started with drinks and appetizers, namely the Italian sausage and calamari.  Both of these were excellent.  The sausage is one long, flavorful link, with some creamy and delicious goat cheese and peppers.  The calamari, meanwhile, is beautifully fried and served on a bed of paper thin fried zucchini reminiscent of homemade veggie chips.  These appetizers, for me, were the best part of the meal.  The main course though...I ordered the gnocci con bolognese, a decent sized helping of potato dumplings in a lamb based sauce.  I was very excited as gnocci and lamb are two of my favorite foods, and the combination sounded great.  The result, though, was almost too salty for me to eat...and I'm not a person who normally has issues with salt. If there were other flavorings, I could barely make them out from under the saline quality, and both this and the sheer amount of the sauce completely overpowered the small, mild gnocci.  The chewy texture of the meat in the sauce was a strange mix with the soft gnocci too, being more akin to pulled pork or roast beef, complete with sections here and there that were tough and dry.  Based on this experience, I would not order this again nor recommend it to anyone.  I do understand that the pizzas and pomodoro pastas were very good, though.  Drinks were another highlight of the meal.  Our server explained that with a few words or a vague idea, the bar would be able to mix up some sort of beverage that we were sure to like, and that seemed to be true.  I am told that the strawberry basalmic cocktail is particularly good and it certainly looks it.  I myself didn't want to become inebriated, though, so I went simply with a glass of passionfruit puree...sort of a passionfruit smoothie really...  That was excellent!  I also ordered a ""cafe caremelo"" which consists of espresso, sweet cream (like a condensed milk), and whipped cream.  It's an odd combination but pretty tasty.  The only thing I'd say is that you really need a tiny spoon so you can either stir it up or just get all of the tasty cream out of the bottom.  Service was very good, especially considering the size of the group and how busy the place was.  Our waiter was attentive and happy to make suggestions.  He also had no major issue splitting up the check so that we were all able to chip in a bit to pay for one of the party members for whom we had gathered to celebrate.  With this and the drinks, the bills could get pretty high, however.  Nothing here is particularly cheap, though prices aren't too much worse than other Italian places of the type.  The menu also does have a lot of interesting items that make it a bit unique, including a long list of tapas-style appetizers and cheese sampler platters.  I am also intrigued by the profiteroles on the dessert menu...  Overall, I can't say I'll be running back here based on my experience, but I will keep it in mind, perhaps for drinks and tapas, if I ever have a large group to entertain.",Carolyn E.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,12/30/13,"We went for happy hour and it was great! Happy Hour lasts from 4-6 (M-TH... I think?), anyways they have great deals. Appetizers and drinks are cheap and the veal meatball is the bomb. Our waiter accidently dropped my drink on my jeans (partly my fault too), and the manager immediately came over with soda water and a towel and an offer to get the jeans dry cleaned on the house. Above average appetizers, great service, and cozy setting all make for a great restaurant experience. I recommend this place, especially during happy hour!",Erich H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2001/9/13,"Great upscale restuarant in shortnorth area.  Very friendly inviting atmosphere filled with yuppies and trendy people.  It is fairly loud in there on a friday or saturday night.  The one thing I remember throughout the night was the meatbal, we had to order 3 of them for the table cause they were that good!  We didn't try the pizza but i had the veal marsala which was sweater than I would have liked but tasty.  my cousin had the beef tenderloin filet which melted in your mouth.  Amazing food and I would definitely come here again.",Neil R.,,,,,,

I'll return as often as I can.",Casey W.,,,,,,

I had called the day before to add a person to my reservation and they were more than friendly and accommodating to my request. My sister likes tapas/appetizer portions and Marcella's did not disappoint. I ordered so many plates that the girls didn't really have to order an entree meal. My sister's favorite was the margherita flat bread, though I was partial to the braised meatball, but everything was delicious. My only complaint would be the noise level, though no fault of the restaurant's...the atmosphere is lively and boisterous, and not the easiest for table conversation, but we managed. All in all, we had a great time, and will be back!",Dawn P.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,9/19/14,"I've  been to Marcellas in the Short North and for the most part enjoy my experience there. Last night, I stopped in for their 3rd Thursday specials when pizza and wine are $5 each. Marcellas has a great Italian ambiance - lots of high energy people eating and drinking in a lively space. Like actual Italian family dining, Marcellas can sometimes feel a little too crammed in the Short North location. However, I really enjoy their happy hour appetizers at Polaris - my one meal outside of last night at Short North was okay. The Short North dining areas though are perfectly lit for an evening date.",John G.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,11/15/13,"The Marcella salad was good, but it had too much dressing and the portion size is small. I believe the salad prices are $6-8.

I forgot the name but it was 3 cream puffs looking bread with ice cream (pistachio, vanilla, and chocolate) with a chocolate syrup on top. I don't care for chocolate but the syrup was really good with the ice cream.",Eszy M.,,,,,,

Just awesome.",Rachel W.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,1/20/13,"I really like Marcella's.  And I love their happy hours.  Why? Because I get to order my favorite dishes for a discounted price.  Most happy hours limit you to appetizer-y items.  But here you can get the flatbreads/pizzas too and those are the best parts of Marcella's menu, if you ask me.  I'm not a huge pasta person and, after tasting my honey's dish, I don't think Marcella's does pasta very well.  I recommend the Caesar salad and the Shrimp & Pesto flatbread.  Thank me later.  The service was blah and, if I recall correctly, the service is always blah when I visit this place.

Since I was treating him to a birthday dinner, he chose Marcella's. This is Italian-American fare done really nicely. There were five of us, including a toddler, so we tried and liked a bit of everything. The service was excellent.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2002/9/12,"My wife and I dined here last night with a friend from out of town. The atmosphere was very nice. Dark, like an Italian restaurant should be, with a nice lively crowd. The dark woods and rustic paint looked great, and the kitchen, outfitted with large old fashioned white tile, was visible from the dining room. Our server wasn't overly chatty, which is nice. Maybe she was a little under-chatty though. Didn't ask if we had any questions about the menu, even when we were perusing it thoroughly for 15 minutes.We started with the grilled pecorino cheese with crostini and apple slices. This was a pretty outstaning appetizer. I'd recommend a few more toast points though, as there was some extra cheese at the end (which we took care of anyway).My wife got the spaghetti with meatball. She said the pasta was fine, as was the sauce, but she was not a fan of the oversized meat hunk. She said the flavor was not what she was expecting, and was not pleasant. Our friend got the cheese ravioli, and said it was wonderful. I got the lasagna. It was a little heavy on the sauce. It actually wasnt very hot either, and the sauce had that coagulated look to it, as if it had been made a little too far in advance. It did taste very good though, once I scraped the excess sauce off.Overall, Marcella's gets a solid three stars.",Zack R.,,,,,,

We ordered a bottle of wine which was brought to the table already opened and then poured into a carafe without anyone being offered a taste before pouring...which by the way we had to pour our own wine out (with a dirty glass provided to us to boot). We ordered two appetizers for a table of five but only received one. The second came after the food, and after we reminded them. Our waiter was no where to be found. Our food finally arrived close to an hour after we ordered and was brought out separately leaving some with cold food before everyone's arrived. The flavor was severely lacking. Bland is the best word I can use to describe it. When we finally finished, we had to stack our own plates and ask for the check.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,5/17/12,"In my humble opinion Cameron Mitchell can do no wrong. For those who don't know he is a local entrepreneur with a few local (awesome) restaurants.Marcella's is the Italian flavor in his portfolio.  It was one of the first places my brother a long time resident and foodie of Columbus took me too.We stared with the Pecorino cheese plate which comes with truffled honey, apple slices and crostini.  You build a little sandwich of heaven with bread, melted cheese, apple slice and honey.  I was a skeptic at first, but have never looked back and order it often.You must do the braised veal meatball!  It is falling apart tender and comes served in its very own pot with lid.  The Polaris location claims the meatball as the 8th wonder of the world.  Yes, I have been to both locations.  The Polaris location also has a patio!The best time to strike is happy hour when drinks and bar menu are discounted.The staff are very well trained and seem to genuinely care.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,4/28/12,"Second time coming here (was here about a year ago) and it was wonderful again. Fairly casual place but great atmosphere and was wall to wall people on a Friday at 7:00. We got a hightop table right at the window which provided lots of people watching opportunities. I can imagine how nice that spot would be with the windows opened up on a warm day.Service was excellent. Very attentive wait staff.Wine: nice variety of Italian wines. Really like the way they provide the option for a 1/4 or 1/2 bottle for most selections. This allowed me to get a 1/2 bottle of the red I wanted while my wife continued with white.Lots of small plate/sharing options and the way to go as there are a lot of good choices. As in our first visit I started off with the small, warm pot of olives. And again we went for the large veal meatball in a marinara sauce. This is also served in an iron cast pot and is amazingly tender and just melts in tour mouth. This is a meatball like no other and highly recommended.We also enjoyed the parmesan crusted grilled onions. Big slices of onions topped with cheese and broiled. May be a bit on the sweet side for some but it goes really with the meatball. We then split the chopped salad which was really good but a bit small to share. Suggest one salad per person.And finally we had the margarita pizza. Big chunks of tomatoes are the highlight and overall good. Only complaint here is the crust could have been slightly thinner, a bit crispier and could have used some cornmeal on the bottom.Overall really like this place and will definitely be back again.",Robert T.,,,,,,

The food is good the atmosphere is fun and generally casual.  It's the best in the summer when they open up the front of the restaurant and those first few rows of seats become patio seats essentially. Now, the crowd and the wait is awful here.  And it is not spaced out well so everyone is on top of each other.  It's not terribly expensive but it's not cheap either.  The drinks are average at best. My suggestion would be to go early in the summer so you can get a primo seat. Grab a glass of wine or two and try a risotto.",Tim S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,8/15/11,"Having been to all of the Mitchell establishments, I can safely say that Marcella's is my least favorite in terms of the food, as well as the atmosphere. (FYI: For a stunning atmosphere, go to M. For deliciousness, head over to Ocean Club.)As I've come to expect from Mitchell restaurants, the food ran the spectrum. A few spectacular dishes and several duds. The beef carpaccio was superbly (lightly) seared, and the texture contrasted quite nicely with the ricotta pancakes. Equally delightful were the two flatbreads ordered: Crispy potato and Veggie. The calamari and bruschetta, however, failed to impress. Digging around for the calamari, I instead came up with fried pieces of zucchini after pieces of zucchini. The bruschetta arrived limp, sodden, and destitute of flavor. Desserts -- much like the small plates -- were a hit-or-miss. The cherry crustada was hard enough, it's more aptly suited as a protection weapon. The chocolate almond cake was pretty average and nothing out of the ordinary. The show stealers, however, were the ricotta cheesecake and the profiteroles. Small in portion, the cheesecake delivered a density and lusciousness that is unique in its own ways. The profiteroles were not your typical cream puffs either. Adorned with a myriad of fillings, the pistachio was, by far, my favorite of the night.Food aside, the atmosphere fits right in with the rest of the Short North, with a tinge of pretentiousness. From a bachelorette party gone wrong (let the sounds of the obnoxiously loud ringing voices lead you to the party) to the family wanting to enjoy a wide array of Italian dishes (usually found towards the back of the restaurant rolling their eyes at the aforementioned party), Marcella's draws a wide and diverse crowd and for different occasions. While that may be suitable for some, others who are looking for a slightly more intimate and quieter environment may want to go elsewhere -- like Z Cucina.",F Z.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2004/10/16,"My daughter and I are in Columbus visiting friends and they brought us to this place that they've been a couple times before. Firstly, the strawberry balsamic martini we had while waiting at the bar for our table was absolutely amazing! The wait for a table was only 20 minutes and they got us seated in a timely fashion. The cheese, olive and cured meat boards have a great selection. Our server was knowledgable and had passionate feelings about some of her favorite items on the menu as well. My friend who has dined here before said she usually has the chicken parm because it's so amazing but tried the chicken Marsala. I thought she was going to lick her plate clean! My daughter had the goat cheese ravioli and she cleaned her plate as well! I was so full from the drinks and pecorino cheese, apples and honey  app that I barely had room to finish the mushroom and truffle oil flatbread I ordered! Can't wait to come back to Columbus to go back to this rustic Italian tapas themed restaurant!",Joylynn S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2007/12/12,"Turning into one of my favorite Columbus spots for dates. My wife, siste-in-law & mother-in-law are all Gluten Free. Marcella's gives one of the most enjoyable dining experiences for Gluten Free eaters I've ever experienced. Their gluten free menus is robust and looks nearly identical to their regular menu. You're not going to feel like an alien here. Their flatbreds have amazing flavor. Happy hour pricing is sweet. Great ambiance.",Adam L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,5/16/13,"By far my favorite restaurant in Columbus. When any out of towners ask me for recommendations I send them here! The atmosphere is casual romance. It's always crowded but you don't feel on top of the the next table, which is important.  When I say it's always crowded, I mean just that. Even if you make reservations you will likely wait 20 minutes for a table on the weekends. The servers are usually on point, typical for a CMR. They are knowledgeable about the food and drinks so ask for recommendations!  I love all the food - you must try the meatball!! They have a lot of different appetizers, my favorites are the mozzarella cheese or the calamari. My go to entree is definitely the fettuccine meatball. The pizzas are great as well!",Andrea H.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2/16/14,"Very busy Thursaday night in the Short North so I made a reservation. No point, still waited longer than most, so not a great start. Rather noisy, but still able to hold a conversation. Good took a bit, but was delicious. Calamari was light and fresh, sausage pizza was tasty and flavorful. The veal meatball was excellent. The risotto was a little al dente for my taste but still flavorful. The wait staff were all very nice and helpful. It is a very good Italian restaurant but not one that I am eager to return to.",James R.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,5/16/10,"It's a sad day when yelp disappoints me.  Not our first choice for dinner, but still well reviewed so we tried it.  The waiter's idea of relaxed dining was more like poor, inattentive service.  As for the food:  Calamari was tasty if a bit too salty.  Bread was dry and dull. Sicilian pizza was ""pedestrian "" in the word of my uberhot date. Lasagna was mush with Hamburger helper.   Need I say more?No need to ever go to this place again.",Marianne C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,12/13/11,"Pros: Great location in Short North, trendy atmosphere, good food.Cons: Noisy, salad and bread are extra (a la carte menu), waitress hardly came around.No plans to go back. Plenty of other great options in the city.",Adrianne K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2011/4/13,"I was pleasantly surprised that Marcella's was part of a chain (Cameron Mitchell).  There were so many personal touches offered.  We were visiting Columbus, celebrating my daughter's 18th birthday.  I chose Marcella's based on TripAdvisor and Yelp reviews.   I made reservations a few days ahead, thru Open Table.  The restaurant is located in Short North, which was bustling on a chilly Saturday night in November.  There was valet parking adjacent to the restaurant.  Our party of 4 arrived at the reserved time and we were seated withing 5 minutes of arriving.  The restaurant was PACKED with patrons.  I would describe the atmosphere as casual italian, kind of a laid back vibe but the food and service was AMAZING.  Dinner started with our water glasses being filled with filtered water artfully served from glass bottles.  We were then served fresh sliced ciabatta bread (there is olive oil and plates in the center of each table for dipping).  We place our food and drink order.  I ordered the red sangria, which arrived in a carafe, along with a separate glass of ice and cut-up fruit that had been soaked in sangria.  I thought that this was a very nice touch and the sangria was very good.  I ordered the Fettucine & Meatball which consisted of fettucine noodles (perfectly al dente), lightly dressed in alfredo sauce served on a bed of marinara sauce and topped with the most flavorful and tender meatball.  The meatball was easily the size of a baseball.  The entree portion was very generous and reasonably priced at just $13!!!.   My husband and 2 daughters had the chicken parmesan and spagetti and meatballs and were equally pleased with their selections.   My daughters and I opted to share a dessert.  The profiteroles were outstanding and proved to be the perfect finale to our dinner.   There were 3 profiteroles, 1 each filled with pistachio, chocolate and honey vanilla ice cream and then drizzled with warm chocolate ganache.  I opted for the pistachio was SO good.  The service was great.  Our server was attentive to our needs and there were several managers that help with service to make the experience seamless. Total bill for 4 entrees, 2 cocktails, 2 soft drinks and 1 shared dessert was $84.   I would definitely return!!!",Kelly R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2008/7/13,"my rating has been improved only because of the food quality. We went there last Saturday night and the service was really bad. we made a reservation for 8 people and one more turned up. so we had to wait despite arriving on time. that's fine, it is what it is. however, the staff was very lukewarm in their service. I guess our waiter was very busy, but I don't know why he was not showing up at all... we had to remind him to serve us bread, water, etc. from time to time. we didn't get a single smile: not from the front desk, not from our waiter, not from the other waitresses who occasionally brought out some items. I thought it was incredibly rude, and it seems like they only had a problem with our table, since tables adjacent to us were served quicker and more efficiently. was it they were frustrated because we turned up with one extra person? I don't know but it hardly seems fair. Whenever we asked for a refill of our waters, or to see the dessert menu, it seemed like it was a chore for them.can't complain about the food, it was fantastic! however, the behavior of the staff in general put a damper on our spirits for sure. I can't say I will go there again, which is a pity, because I really did like the food.",Niranjani D.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,8/13/15,Love the food and wine and atmosphere. Oh and the pricing!  The cheese tray with a nice Cabernet is always welcome!  My only problem is I have to avoid the weekend night crowd because it's too hard to talk with the crowd there.,Nancy M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2005/6/9,"What a day!  I no sooner pulled up to Marcellas when a parking spot opened up, right across the street.  How's that for luck!  And I went inside and Happy Hour was in full swing, making most of the food, and a lot of the wine, half price.  So I started off with a meatball and an order of sliced onions parmesean.  Those onions were great.  I'll have to try making them at home.  And the meatball was as tender as I've ever had one.  I also had a carafe of Reisling.  It was half price also.I was going to order a pizza but I didn't have enough room so I settled for an order of Proscuitto.  What a great meal, and my tab before tip was only $12.81.",Paul F.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2001/6/12,"On a recent visit to Columbus I decided to give Marcella's a try. I noticed right away that I was in time for happy hour which not only included 1/2 price drinks but also a good selection of 1/2 price food options. I had an order of zucchini chips (good but some what greasy), a veal meatball (tasty and tender), 2 specialty cocktails (both great), and very large square of tiramasu (more like a moist cake but very good.

I'm a big fan of their arrabbiata sauce. It's the perfect amount of heat with a great garlic finish. I also loved their arancini.

The fish was slightly overcooked, and had no flavor at all. It was completely bland. The carrots and the greens were tasty, and cooked properly. I did have a very enjoyable drink with strawberries and balsamic, (don't remember what it was called though.) Now for the service....Wow, it was really awful. Our server seemed like she was from another planet. When we needed her, she was impossible to find. I actually had to get out of my seat and track her down to tell her about the hair. Surprise, surprise, when i found her, she was chatting with a co-worker. Waters were kept refilled after requesting a refill at the start of the meal. Really though, what a total letdown.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2008/9/11,"Mark this as my favorite Italian to date in Columbus.  This is a big deal.  When people ask me what my favorite Italian in the city is, I am the snotty Italian girl that says ""my house"".  But for Marcella's?  If I'm going to  change my mind, it's for this place.  This is a little more pricey, but what you get for your money (to me) is so worth it.  Drinks have the right amount of alcohol whether it's a manhattan or sangria.  Entrees are delish in all my experiences (I especially swoon for the lamb gnocci and the goat cheese ravioli).  Mostly I go here with people I want to catch up with, so the only thing I can say for the service is I never wonder where they are.  I know I usually have a drink and never wait too long before having someone to ask for something.  The thing I do love is the noise level.  It's a busy place, but I never feel like I'm shouting to talk to my friends.Sigh.  I fall in love all over again just thinking about this place.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2/18/09,"I forgot to factor in the hour time difference traveling from Chicago to Columbus so we missed the happy hour, but doesn't matter.  It was a relatively inexpensive meal and I was satisfied with the meals.  The linguine with clams had a spicy kick to it.  But the real sleeper was the veggie pizza.  It felt like Larry the Plumber Gambino shot me in the back with a silencer and revived from cardiac arrest.  I can't even remember the last time I had pizza this good, maybe it was another life.  If I was living in Columbus, I would go to happy hour for pizza and drinks every week.

This was actually very tasty, perfectly thinly sliced cured pieces of goodness. Great way to start the meal. Entree wise, I got the veal saltimbocca and my girlfriend got the seared salmon. My dish was nothing special, very average in taste, presentation, texture, etc. The polenta was also a little dry and gummy. It was very much a letdown from the prosciutto de parma.

If you don't arrive at the restaurant at 4pm exactly the odds of you enjoying the happy prices are slim.  As for the food, ""bella messio!""   My friends and I began the event with a sangria of some sort of citrus deliciousness,  moving on to salads where in I allowed my tongue to dance over a tart granny smith and gorgonzola spring mix...funky cheese heaven.

I'm not a beef eater but I'm now a lover of the cured. and there is no such thing as too much cheese. I think I see more trendy in my future.",Toine R.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2001/7/11,"I really wanted to like Marcella's, but I have to be honest and say that I was underwhelmed. I went for the first time on New Year's Eve, so that may be part of the issue. They were incredibly busy. I will plan to go back on a non-holiday night! We had a group of 11 people. I made the reservations nearly a month in advance on OpenTable.com for 10 people and they were nice enough to let me add another person the day before! The drinks were awesome! I got their special called Berries and Bubbles, which had berries and champagne and something else. It was delicious! As for the food, maybe I just chose the wrong menu items. My husband and I started with the calamari. I found it to be a bit too salty and there was way more of the zuchinni than the calamari. The marinara sauce that it came was good, though.I played it safe and got the chicken parm for dinner, with a red sauce on my pasta rather than the alfredo. I did not care for the red sauce and I thought the chicken was a bit greasy. On the other hand, I tasted a lot of my friends' dishes and really liked them! The veal meatball, the risotto special (lobster, lemon, etc.), and the gnocchi were all pretty awesome. Dessert was great, too. We had chocolate almond cake. I'll probably get that next time! Yum!Overall, as busy as they were, the service was quick. Our waiter was really nice- he even split the checks up! My food choices may have been the wrong ones, but I'll defiintely give it another try.",Dawn K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,12/16/10,"When you can get a meatball as big as your fist that can practically serve as a whole meal on its own, you know you're in good hands. Marcella's Ristorante offers said meatball either as an appetizer or as a whole meal on top of pasta. It's the most tender and flavorful veal meatball I have ever had. It's what the restaurant is known for. I highly recommend it!I have also had the calamari appetizer and the chicken parmesean, which are also both right up there with the glowing recommendation I had for the meatball. I can not speak for the rest of the menu, as I have only been a couple of times, but everything that is listed at least LOOKS like it'd be amazing.What is also great about Marcella's is the decor. It is an enormous restaurant with dark, sleek wood, cool spherical hanging lights (lit dark, but not too dark), and an impressively long fully stocked bar. The coolest feature that Marcella's can boast of is its large window-front that actually folds in and opens completely, transforming the enclosed restaurant into an open patio in a matter of seconds. It's absolutely perfect on a cool summer or spring night.This is a top notch Italian restaurant, and I would go as far to say it's the best I have had in the Short North (far better than Black Olive, and just a notch above Martini and Rossi...which are both pricier even). Mama mia!",Mike E.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2/22/13,"I have been here twice and I don't think it's really all that impressive! The first time I was here..it was supposed to be a romantic date, but we were seated next to the kitchen and the trays where waiters collect the dirty dishes. The clanking of the dishes was sooo loud that I could not hear the conversation we were having. We had to ask them to be moved, and the staff acted as if it was an inconvenience. I don't they they should be seating anyone near the kitchen and those dirty dishes in the first place, and we had a reservation, so I dont know why they would seat us there! Anyways, we both had pastas, and I can't remember what I had (maybe it was spaghetti and meatball), but I remember the portions were kind of small. The food was delicious but if I am paying 13+ dollars for pasta, I would like it in a slightly bigger plate! Also, the waitress messed up on our wine; she gave us a litre, when we asked for half litre. It was nice of her to just let us pay for the half litre since it was her mistake, even though we were happy to pay for what we drank.The second time we were here, it was in a party of 4. We came around 11 pm for a late night meal and sat on the high table in the bar area! It was hard to get a waiter's attention, but all our needs were met. I do love the bread here. I ordered linguine and clams and it was very very good, but again, small portion. I would only come back here if i'm asked to by friends, but I would not come back here on my own choosing. Overall, it's not bad, and it's really not that great! I can make better pastas at home for much better prices!",Justine L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2006/12/15,"Ok, I'll start off by saying I'll try to be as objective as I can in this review due to my complete disdain for American Italian food (OMG pasta and pizza fuck yeaaaa.... no). This is a typical Cameron Mitchell joint.. meaning that it's generally overhyped and slightly overpriced. If that's a concern go during happy hour. They do have a bomb ass happy hour which is why I'm even giving this place 3 stars. Drinks are half off and so are the pizzas and apps which is super clutch. Don't get me wrong their pizzas are good.. but it's fucking pizza, this isn't some complex Top Chef creation of duck liver souffle with black caviar topped whipped potatoes. The pasta is... just that, pasta. You get noodles you boil that shit, add some sauce, spices, veggies, and meat and BOOM... that's a wrap. Even someone with lukewarm temperature IQ can accomplish that. This is the point where you might say ""but Srebrina!!! the sauce is housemade!!"" No way, they boiled and pureed some tomatoes and added spices to it.. get the fuck outta town! The salads and apps are good and I would stick to those hence why you should make full use of the happy hour. The meat ball is tasty (meat ball... har har har) and the antipasta salad is very good. As far as drinks go I haven't found one that has been a go to. The Tuscan Limonata is pretty much just a sprits of belvi with enough sugar to make a pitcher of kool-aid jealous. The strawberry balsamic martini is just... weird. It's mostly ""foam"" that looks and tastes like cool whip left out in the sun (and looks like well... think something else that's white and gross) and strawberry flavored sugar. I'm not a fan of brown liquors so I can't remark on those.. hopefully they are more on point. The wine selection though is good so that's a solid go to.. once again, *cough* go during happy hour *cough* The interior of the place is good.. not a crazy fan of the 0.5 square foot round top tables because I'm short and I feel like I'm Dr. Evil's Mini-Me with my feet dangling like I'm cruisin' town on the short bus. The bathrooms are nice.. only beef is the soap they have, it's white and powdery (I get it it's suppose to be ""authentic"".. whatever.. I never saw don Corleon use this shit in Godfather!) I feel like my hands are at a Lindsey Lohan/Charlie Sheen party... powdered out, sticky, and still dirty. Overall this place is ok, for American-Italian food it's one of the better ones. Not sure if I mentioned this before... but go during happy hour.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,1/14/11,"Wow, am I surprised to see these 5 star reviews!I had the spaghetti and meatballs when I came here after the Jane's Addiction concert last year.Yeah the meatballs are huge, and soft, because they have enough corn flakes in them as a filler to kill a horse.  Meatballs, made of ground meat, should have roughly the same consistency as a hamburger.  For a more tender meatball, mix in some ground veal, not half a box of corn flakes.Maybe I am too hard on Italian restaurants because I can turn out such high quality Italian food myself, but this is yet another example of a sorry ass Cameron Mitchell restaurant.  I have yet to eat at one I have liked.",Big Baby Jesus C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2010/12/12,"I'm going to start with the fact that I don't frequently give 5 stars; however, Marcella really impressed me so I see it fitting to give the max stars. I travel frequently for work and use yelp to help me find good places to eat. Mostly I'm seeking spots with a good vibe, good food & reasonable prices...stranger things have happened.. I know these places exist... And in Columbus, Marcella hit the nails on the head. We were referred to go here by the counter staff at Chocoholic a few stores down (another awesome place that really impressed me!) Luckily it was happy hour when we arrived (4PM to 6 PM) 50 percent off most of their menu, which is Italian tapas style of small plates, cheeses.. Meats.. Salads and pizzas...  Everything was delicious. Veal/Beef meatball, beef carpaccio... cheese plates but I forget which ones.. all very good. All wine $9 dollars a glass and under was also Half price for happy hour. Such a pleasant surprise to stumble in here during their awesome special. Our server Lindsey was very nice and attentive. Great ambience. Just overall how a restaurant should be in my opinion. I feel like we ordered a million things to try.. we left very satisfied for under $50 bucks for 2 people (including 3+ glasses of wine.)  I wish Marcella was in my city. It would become a regular spot to frequent.Great date spot (esp during HH) great for groups.",Nicole W.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,7/19/10,"Marcella's = Happiness!To quote Cheryl H, I love, love, love Marcella's!  Anytime we want a special night out, this is our no-brainer.  It's cool and casual, and I feel at home in a t-shirt and shorts or all dressed up.  The service and the food are always great, and that's surprisingly hard to find!  Here's what I love:* Pineapple Vodka straight up as a martini - Trust me on this one! It's amazing!  The pineapple has been soaking for days in the vodka, and it makes the perfect cocktail!  But beware, the pineapple chunk is not for the faint of heart, err, liver.  * Melted pecorino - This is heaven!  The cheese comes in a little skillet with toasted bread, honey, and apple slices.  Mmmm!* Beet Salad - If you're a beet lover, then get this salad!  It's my favorite beet salad in all of Columbus!* Flatbreads - Any of them. Just get them.",Bryant M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,11/29/12,"THE best happy hour in Columbus. I have easily been here over 50 times in the past 2 years! As prior reviews have detailed, select wines and beers are half off from 4-6pm on weekdays, as well as appetizers, salads, and pizzas.  Marcella's really is perfect for all occasions! The atmosphere is unique: very dim and a bit noisy, yet intimate. I try to steer clear of this place on weekends, though, because it is always packed and meter parking is a nightmare (valet is available).  It is a big step up from places like Bravo and Carabba's, and there are some very creative dishes that I have never seen at an Italian restaurant, in addition to classics such as chicken parmesan and lasagna.  If you go during happy hour, you can walk out of there with a full stomach, a buzz, and a $15 tab...that is worthy of 5 stars in my book!",Lindsey O.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,5/13/11,"Excellent food, atmosphere, service and prices. I have to say that up until now Carrabas was my favorite Italian restaurant. I love this place. I am in Columbus for 7 days and I see myself eating here at least 3 - 4 days out of 7.",Keyshaun S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,10/24/11,"Had dinner here last night, it was busy for a Sunday night but still had a good service. Our server Lauren was great and friendly. We ordered the veal meatball for appetizer, fettucine meatball and ravioli messaluna for dinner. Delicious! We wanted to purchase one of their shirts but they didn't have any however they were kind enough to get our information so they could let us know once they ordered them.",Sarah L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,2007/12/8,"If you're in search of a yuppified hotspot to drink wine and oggle at overdressed women in their early 30's, Marcella's will serve as a satisfying end to that quest. If you're looking for a simple, hassle-free Italian dinner, however, you're in the wrong place.As opposed to Martini, local-hero restauranteur Cameron Mitchell's attempt at more conventional Italian dining, Marcella's feels more like a trendy big-city tapas bar than it does an actual restaurant. The menu consists mostly of small a la carte items like meatballs, pasta dishes, and salads, with the idea being that you and your party go berserk and order everything on the menu to piece together the ultimate smattering of Sicily's finest offerings. Throw in a few bottles of wine and a frantic atmosphere in a busy section of town and you've got yourself the perfect beginning to a night on the town.With the way the aforementioned menu operates, the blame for assembling an uninspired meal rests squarely on the shoulders of the consumer.  The alfredo pasta I ordered on my first visit was firm and creamy, but did not bide well with the meatball I ordered to accompany it. After much deliberation and confusion, my finally dad pieced together a spaghetti and meatballs combo that did not put a smile on his face, to the least. I sampled the wood-fired pepperoni pizza that my sister unadventurously decided on and was pleasantly surprised with both the texture of the mozzarella and the zest kick of the pepperoni. For what looked like a burnt slab of cardboard, the crust wasn't bad either.Eventually, my family and I became incredibly annoyed with both the waitstaff and the overall scene of the restaurant on the Sunday evening that we stopped by. People were constantly coming and going behind the table we were seated at, and our waitress interpreted our confusion with the menu as the mark of true yokels that were unfit to be seen in such a place. I've heard the same complaint for a handful of friends that went through a similar experience when they took their family to Marcella's, so at least it's comforting to know that we were not alone.Needless to say, I would not recommend this place for a casual dinner with a large group of family or even friends. There are way too many power-business types and the gold-digging floozies that they attract to make the environment in here inviting enough to merit my recommendation of Marcella's as a favorable alternative to, say, Martini, which happens to be two blocks up the street. So unless you're with a date and are in the mood for a lively atmosphere to sip a glass of wine or two (almost forgot: the sangria here was the one part of my meal that I DID enjoy and asked for seconds of), do yourself a favor by skipping this place.",Pete C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,9/17/10,"Taste: 3Value: 3Service: 4I came here with a group of 8 coworkers around 8pm last night since it was my birthday, and one of my coworkers is getting married this weekend. Despite making a reservation on opentable.com for 8pm, we ended up having to wait until 8:30pm before we were seated.1. Melted pecorino cheese, $10A bit overrated. The pecorino cheese was all right, but really it's just a small baked tray of the cheese, some slices of semi-crisp bread, thin apple slices, and some honey. Good, but not worth $10 in my opinion.2. Risotto of the day (chicken with mushrooms and mozzarella), So-so. The rice was cooked well, but the other ingredients in it didn't really stand out. However, it was pretty creamy.3. White sangria, $25/literI normally drink red sangrias, but this white one was actually quite tasty. Wasn't able to get any of the fruit out because of the vase though, which was slightly disappointing.4. Veal meatballsAll right. The veal was cooked well, but they're still just meatballs.5. Tiramisu, $6Free bday dessert, and pretty good tiramisu. My friend asked the server for a candle, which she actually brought over. Service overall was pretty spot-on, although our server referred to me as the birthday boy like 5-6 times.Total was $33 before tax/tip. Overall, decent Italian, but I'd rather go to Basi Italia.",David L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,7/29/14,"Pre-celiac, this was one of my favorite restaurants in Columbus. Luckily, I can say the same even now! Pretty much their entire normal menu is gluten free and they have a separate gluten free menu and SEPARATE OVENS/PREP AREAS! An italian restaurant with gluten free everything options?! Amazing. Pizza crusts are crispy and everything else is delicious. Loved the cheesy onion app and the chicken parm. They even have GF bread that they bring out to the table and it's actually really good. Great wine selection and lovely ambiance - dim, spacious yet intimate. Great date spot, drinks with the girls, group dinners, etc. Also, the service is always phenomenal: Our waiter let us try a bunch of wines before we settled on one. Then, when my friend left her to-go box of pizza at the table and came back for it, only to realize they had tossed it...he made her an entire new pizza! Can't think of a better restaurant for delicious gluten free finds, and great service.",Piyali F.,,,,,,

As usually the melted pecorino was excellent. We sat in the bar area (I prefer to sit in chairs with backs) and our server was really sweet and accommodating...

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,4/30/14,"I want to take a bath in Marcella's risotto or the meatball sauce. Ok...maybe that's a little gross...but that is the level of love I feel toward this amazing Italian restaurant. I am a bit hard-to-impress when it comes to Italian food, but Marcella's does it for me. You can tell they use high-quality ingredients and everything from my cocktail to the Crispy Potato pizza were perfection. I took my mother and her partner when they visited Columbus and am planning on taking another out-of-town guest next weekend. Everyone who passes through and visits me will have to stop in to Marcella's (can I have visitors every day now?). My mother and her partner both raved about the place and - as proper as my mother can be - I think she may have considered licking the meatball pot to get more of that perfect tomato sauce. My risotto was creamy, rich perfection with house made sausage and quality mozz. If there is a heaven, I am convinced that Marcella's food will be served in the mess hall in the sky. Additional notes: Our server was very nice and knowledgable and this place has great ambience. Also, for the quality of food, Marcella's was very reasonably priced.",Marni K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,1,1/18/13,"I have had two good experiences at Marcella's, but wow... not this time. Dirty water glasses... hand prints all over, dirty beverage glass... the classic lipstick goo, dirty appetizer plate.... just plain dirty. Seafood Risotto... I asked if they had it... turns out it was a feature, but the server didn't know about it. Gluten free bread.... 50% soaked in bad tasting oil... tasted like a dirty grill. The risotto was WAY undercooked and the seafood COMPLETELY overcooked and rubbery. The manager was very apologetic and comped our meal after trying to tell me I was mixing up the menu from their location with the one at Polaris (don't know how that entered into the conversation, but okay). What a disappointing and colossal waste of time.",Julie J.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,9/24/12,"A week later and I am still torn as to how I feel about Marcella's.  The space is nice and open, there is a vibrant bar scene, and the staff is incredibly friendly.  However I am torn on the food....I started off with some grapefruit drink which was beyond awesome.  We started out with the beef carpaccio, it was a big serving and I loved the ricotta pancake.  For our mains, I ordered the crispy potato flatbread and my date order the gnocchi.  The flatbread was good, but the potatoes were literally just potato chips on top.  I picked them off.  The gnocchi were perfect little pillows of awesomeness , but as other reviewers have said, the sauce was quite salty.  One point that I found annoying is that my flatbread took five minutes to come out after the gnocchi.  Luckily I have no problem eating off someone else's plate, but I would expect a CM restaurant to be able to produce two entrees at the same time....The experience was good, not great.  I won't turn away from Marcella's, but it won't be in my top recommendations either....",Sarah G.,,,,,,

The drinks are creative but a little pricey IMHO.I have always had good service but if you are looking for an Italian restaurant where the servers are ""excited"" about the food and truly have a passion for what they do, then you might be in the wrong place.Ill keep coming back for a casual night out!4 stars",Michael T.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,2007/8/12,"Salt city bitch, salt salt city bitch....Okay, seriously, this was the very last stop on an 11-day roadtrip from Pittsburgh to Austin and back, and we may or may not have been so delirious at that point that we made up a rap about Marcella's. To the tune of Rack City, of course...But that basically says it all...salt, salt, and more salt. This Italian girl was not impressed (and very thirsty by the end of the meal).The calamari was too salty. The fried zucchini mixed with the calamari was even saltier. About 30 seconds after our calamari arrived, our pasta dishes appeared. Our server said, ""Your pastas are ready already, is that okay?"" My reply: ""No, it actually isn't. We haven't even touched our calamari yet."" She seemed mad. I mean, she asked if it was okay, and it wasn't. Sorry girl, don't be mad at me! Be mad at yourself for not either waiting until you put in our dinner order to the kitchen or just telling the kitchen, yo, wait a minute to start those pastas. I mean like, what? I just didn't want my pasta to be cold!So the pastas. My friend's gnocchi was decent, but the bolognese sauce was again, salty. My carbonara was not at all what I expected. Carbonara is my absolute favorite pasta preparation, and theirs was pretty terrible. There was no flavor really except...you guessed it...salt. The dish was topped with a single egg yolk. While this makes for a nice presentation, it doesn't do much for flavor. The size of the serving would have needed 2 or 3 yolks. It also needed more onion or garlic or butter. Basically, more of everything, except salt.I had a massive Italian craving after my roadtrip through the land where my people had not settled, and this did not satisfy it at all. I hope this isn't the best Italian food in Columbus, you poor souls. It's better than the Olive Garden, but not by much.",Meghan C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2009/8/10,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday upon request. There are just so many things to love about this place that I couldn't help myself.I am a lover of Italian food. I swear, Jersey girls are all raised on a diet of Italian food, strip mall Chinese food and ice cream (+chicken noodle matza ball soup if you're Jewish). Growing up, we could only pray that our metabolisms could handle it. So it's no surprise that Italian food is deeply comforting to me. There's nothing more that I want for my birthday than those warm and fuzzy feelings that you can only get from your friends and some delicious birthday food. Once we arrive, the place seems relaxed and informal. The windows are open and the food smells divine. Although, I feel as that this place is having a bit of an identity crisis - it wants to be hip and 'business' casual but also wants to be relaxed and informal at the same time. I wore a dress (that I had also worn to work, mind you) but that seemed to over do it, but shorts would definitely under do it. Baaaaaaah! Over thinking this...Anyway, we order a plate of fried calamari, a favorite of mine as you can tell from my other reviews. It came with a red sauce (meh) and a spicy mayo/ tartar sauce (yum!). I love that you could tell that it was fresh, none frozen calamari. You can tell because squid is not supposed to be too rubbery - the longer its chilled/ frozen, the more rubbery it is. It came out piping hot and totally delicious.I had gotten the Risotto of the day - a Aborio rice tossed with shrimp - my favorite. Let me just say that risotto is HARD and I mean, really HARD to make. Believe me, I've only tried to cook it a zillion times.  Marcella's did it perfectly. It was warm and delectable. Also compliments on the fresh shrimp in it. Seriously, it was unbelievable and probably some of the best risotto I've ever had.The service that night was great as well. I did however feel a little bit rushed. The appetizer came out lightening fast as did the main course. Sure it was done perfectly but I like savoring my food. Slow down Marcella's, where's the fire?! All in all, thanks for a delicious birthday dinner Marcella's!",Rachel P.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2006/2/14,Veal meatball and crispy potato pizza were tasty. Used complimentary bread (more like French than ciabatta) to sop up chunky tomato sauce meatball was sitting in. Arugula went well on the pizza. Carbonara was subpar though. Spaghetti doesn't go well. Should have used angel hair. Flavors were lacking as well.,Monty B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2008/12/10,"Marcella's is good. That's all. I don't love that it's a Cameron Mitchell restaurant (I am a fan of independently owned eateries). But that being said, the food IS pretty good. The mushroom truffle pizza is the best. The gnocchi is To. Die. For.  The wine selection is incredible (albeit expensive). My biggest pet peeve? It's always so damn crowded. Don't go on Friday or Saturday night.",Molly B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2006/12/10,"I give Marcella's 5 stars because the food was delicious, the prices were reasonable, and the staff was so friendly! My boyfriend and I ordered 2 appetizers, a sample of cured meats, a pizza, and a pasta, which was more than plenty to fill us up.  The braised veal meatball was so tender and flavorful.  The seasoning wasn't overpowering, and the texture and simple tomato sauce made this one of my favorites.  The arancini - fried risotto - was crispy on the outside and came with a tangy marinara sauce.  Though good, this was not as impressive as the veal meatball appetizer.  We ordered the crispy potato pizza, The fried potato slices, we thought, actually took away from the rest of the pizza, but the crust was delicious.  We will probably try a different pizza in the future.  The gnocchi con bolognese was absolutely fantastic!  I had heard that this would be a flavorful dish, and it certainly did not disappoint.  I was afraid the lamb ragu would be too gamey for me, but it wasn't.  I thought it was spiced well and was tender without completely melting into the sauce.  Overall, a wonderful experience and I can't wait to go again.",Jonathan S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,9/25/13,"I took my girlfriend to Marcella's for her birthday and got to see first-hand what all of the fuss is about. one word: Meatball. If you go there and don't order it, you are a fool! The service was relaxed and friendly -- which made the evening perfect. We also got the calamari app which comes with two great sauces and is breaded to perfection. The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars was the lamb gnocci. I read many times on here that it was an outstanding dish, so I guess I'm the odd man out. It's like a pulled-pork style of lamb and HUGE balls of gnocci that were hard to take down. The lamb by itself would have been great on a sandwich, but as a whole-- the dish was a let-down. Everything else we ordered was fantastic though and I will definitely be going back",Tom S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,7/22/10,"Yeah, pretty good! The architectural atmosphere is by far the best part of Marcella's with the food coming in a close second. I seriously felt like I could be assassinated by the mafia at any moment when I was in the bathroom (yup, with the powdered soap), which was a definite plus. Pretty sure it's every guy's dream to be in a mob movie - assassinated or not (though preferentially not, but whatever it takes for the atmosphere. I'm not selfish, I'll take one for the team).The actual people atmosphere wasn't so great. I don't mind louder restaurants normally, but this one was actually a little much. I could hear the people immediately to my left and right, but any further down than that... fugetaboutit. That was too bad especially since I had new people meeting each other for the first time. So maybe bear that in mind if you want a solid cross-table convo or you have people meeting for the first time.Marcella's is really a neat place, though. Cool architecture, good food, and an assassination-probable bathroom make it a fun place to check out.",Matt R.,,,,,,

Way too doughy and not tasty at all.

However, I also have to concede that I really like the restaurant. It has a neat atmosphere and the food is flavorful. I especially like the veal meatball. The stone oven pizzas have a crunch crust that can compete with any great pizza joint in Columbus. Gotta dig those olives too!The portion sizes are reasonable. The chance to have dessert (blueberry cheesecake!) more than makes up for the lack of leftovers or a stomach ache.The prices are on the lower end the Cameron Mitchell (or Short North, for that matter) spectrum.The service is great too.The restaurant is probably best suited to small to medium groups. It's very social feel. It's probably not the best place for a romantic dinner for two.In the Short North, it's a great place for drinks and appetizers. If you want to avoid the crowds a bit, check out the Polaris location. It's just as good.",Randy S.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2011/12/8,"Marcella's is another Cameron Mitchell concept, but it's totally different from Martini.

Hands down the best ravioli in the world - that's right, in the entire world. It was so creamy and filling.If you're into cheese, try Marcella's; cheese is kind of their thing.

(though often you'll still have to wait 20 minutes or so for a table.)",Cheryl H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,12/16/10,"Just visited Marcella's this weekend as a friend and I were in town for a volleyball tournament and staying in the downtown area. We needed to carb-load and decided on this Italian Restaurant after looking on Yelp. I have to say, this was definitely the best restaurant we ate at all weekend. As we walked in, the staff warmly greeted us as we stood in this dimly lit restaurant (great date place) to get out of the cold. They quickly brought us to our table where I began with the Blood Orange Bitter Soda, which had the perfect amount of Tequila mixed with the perfect amount of mixers. For my main course I ordered the special of the night (Risotto Del Giorno) which was a Seafood Risotto. Ugh, it was cooked to perfection and had the right amount of seasoning and flavor to it. The portion was not ridiculous, but it was perfect for a satisfying dinner. My only complaint about the place, other than the large drunken party that hovered around our table area, which was unfortunately situated next to the bar, was that the waitress was a little cold. It was not poor service by any means, but just a little distant, if that makes any sense. She brought the check before we asked her too, didn't visit as much as we would have liked, and picked our check up (as she looked at the tip) almost immediately. However, in the end, the next time I am in Columbus, I will definitely visit Marcella and her Ristorante again!",Arturo C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,12/26/11,"Started the night with a meat and cheese platter. Amazing! Kept things simple with the Pasta Arrabiata($13), spicy goodness in my mouth! This place had consistent Italian food at a fair price. Also made a great Manhattan... If your in the mood for Italian, give this place a try!",Ryan B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2005/10/10,"I recently had dinner here with several old friends from college.  This restaurant has a great location and atmosphere.  It's easy to find parking close by, and it is right in the heart of charming Short North.  Much of the menu is tapas style, and is really great.  The only complaint I heard was from my vegetarian friend- if you don't eat meat you're pretty much relegated to cheese and bread (according to her).  They have a fabulous selection of pizzas and cured meats to choose from, as well as assorted cheeses.  All of these go perfectly with a pitcher or two of sangria.  I had the Apple salad, red sangria, and an assorted cheese plate served with honey and apricot preserves.  I recommend them all, especially the salad.  Possibly the best I've had of this type.Overall, I'd definitely recommend Marcella's to anyone looking for casual, fun dining with great service and great food.",Alli T.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2/23/11,"Marcella's is by far one of my favorite restaurants to grab dinner with friends or have a romantic night out. My boyfriend and I go a lot, and like to try a little bit of everything. My fave small plates would definitely have to be the bruschetta, melted pecorino cheese and the arancini. The great thing about Marcellas is you can get a bunch of small plates or opt for a couple of the entrees to share. I have tried a lot of things on their menu and never been disappointed. Two of the best entrees I've had there are the risotto (changes daily) and the penne alla arrabiatta. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the service is usually hit or miss. I've definitely had more luck with the actual servers than the bar staff. While they make great drinks, the bartenders are usually not overly friendly or attentive. All in all though, definitely worth a try!",Jessica H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2012/7/10,"Great selection of beers and the food is solid too.  I went for a happy hour on a Monday and it turns out that the beers were 1/2 off as well as any glass of wine under $9 dollars.The service was rock solid and the bartender was able to recommend me beers based on what I usually drink.  I tried the Great Lakes Brewing Co. which isn't found in St. Louis and there was both the Christmas Ale and Edmund Fitzgerald Porter - DELICIOUS.  The TrÌ¦egs Mad Elf was pretty good too but a little fruity for my tastes.Anyway, I tried the pesto shrimp pizza and the meatball here.  Both solid picks.  Overall, I was very happy to try this place out and if I migrate to Columbus next year, it definitely is going to be a regular joint for me.",Jae K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,5/24/12,"Wonderful flatbread pizzas! Space a little cramped, and don't inhale the powdered soap in the restroom by accident. :-) But overall I enjoy Marcella's. My parents and I usually go here when they visit me at OSU.",Courtney Q.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,3/29/12,"Service staff was warm and friendly.  Wine list had a nice variety of both Italian and American wines.

The Beef Carpaccio with Ricotta Pancakes and celery is fantastic.",Bryan P.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,5/13/10,"I definitely agree with all the other Yelpers who have specifically called out the fantastic happy hour specials and flexibility of the small plates.  Marcella's is the perfect place to come if you just don't want the full commitment of an entree.  Some of my favorites dishes are the veal meatball, arancini, white anchovy with tuscan bread salad and crispy potato pizza (which actually would be better without the crispy potato part of the equation). The only thing I didn't like is the zucchini parmesan - and I've been fooled twice by this.  I've got to remember to stop ordering it.  Just too greasy. I've actually never been in the main dining room area because the front area with the high top tables by the windows is just too much fun.  But you've gotta be somewhat ruthless to secure a table at peak times.  Which is a lot of the time.Most of the wines offered are Italian and are categorized form light to full-bodied.  There are 3 sizes to choose from - a glass++, half bottle or full bottle.  I can't think of many other places that have this option.",Caroline C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2008/1/12,"4 stars for regular menu, 5 stars for happy hour! I'm head over heels in love with this place. The cheese, meats, small plates, salads, and flatbreads are just heavenly. The entrees in my opinion are just ok, but this place isn't meant to serve entrees - one look at the menu and you can tell it is meant to be a tapas place. The open-air seating in the front when the weather is nice is fantastic. Happy hour prices are ridiculously affordable and you can eat AND drink like a king.",Whitney S.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,5/25/12,"What a great time at Marcella's last weekend! We had reservations for 5:30 but when we realized we had accidentally parked VERY far away we had to truck it back to the car and call to let them know we'd be late. They were totally fine with it! So, so nice of them to be calm, cool, and collected about that-because it was Friday night and everything, I was expecting we'd have to just go home! So that was a great start to our service. We sat at the bar when we arrived because she did say it'd be a few minutes. Almost right after we ordered our drinks we were buzzed to our table. That was fast! I felt so bad!Our waiter was awesome. He was so nice and helpful, however I'm not sure of his name. He brought us our waters and gave us ample time to look over the menu. When we asked for suggestions he recommended the ravioli [it has goat cheese, mushrooms, cabbage, pancetta..forgive me for forgetting the name!] so we ordered it. We split an entree and also an appetizer of the prusciutto bruschetta, which i'm sure i butchered the spelling of. Anyway. This guy was SPOT ON! The ravioli was probably the most amazing thing I've ever put in my mouth. So creamy and decadent, such perfect flavor. AND THE CABBAGE. What an awesome addition to a dish. I'm a sucker for cabbage in things, and this was just, phenomenal. I want to eat this all day long. Perfect. The bruschetta was also awesome, don't let me downplay that! I have always loved this dish, and I almost always get it when I come here--so tasty! The tomatoes are so flavorful, with fresh herbs and fresh cheese. And the bread is so crispy/moist/soft, it's great.We had a great time. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, yet hip and exciting. Best part-the bill was super cheap and our belly's were both full! Great night at Marcella's in the short north!",Alana H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,11/19/12,"The atmosphere is incredible, the food tastes AMAZING, but every time i have eaten here (maybe 5 times?) i have felt horribly sick afterwards.

But, when I crave Italian is always Marcella's. It's really all about the meatballs. I would be content getting a bottle of wine and a meatball. They are that good. They are legendary meatballs. it's on the costly end, depending on what you get, but well worth the price.So, if you are a fan of a cool atmosphere, great tapas or a huge italian feast- you've to try Marcella's.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,4/26/10,"Its been a while since I've been to Marcella's.  In fact, the last time I was there was last year for a happy hour with CK.  Mmmm...Sangrias, I do remember those!CK and I headed back here Friday night for a bit of nosh.  We didn't want to eat too much (the entire evening was being planned around the prospect of downing muchas Jeni's ice cream) so we thought that Marcella's with its options of small plates would be a good idea.  So must have thought a myriad of other Columbus-ites!  It was busy.  We were told it would be a 30 minute wait, were handed a pager and we decided to take a walk while we were waiting.  45 minutes later we came back and we still weren't up.  It took us nearly an hour to be seated which I'm not knocking Marcella's down for because it was just that popular.  We didn't mind waiting, but just a heads up that on a nice day with the windows open, be prepared for a wait.The hostess was really friendly but our waitress didn't seem to happy to be there.  She just pointed to a table in the corner and told us that would be ours and that she would meet us over there in a few minutes.  Even with the small water glasses, she didn't bring enough water to fill our glasses and didn't offer to bring more until our food came out.  She gave us 3 pieces of bread for 2 people which makes me wonder who gets the 2nd piece.  The food was good though.  We both ended up getting salads.  I got the beet salad which had just the right amount of sweetness and had a nice amount of goat's cheese.  CK had an apple salad and she said it was good (it looked good!).  The portion sizes were perfect and left me feeling satiated but not full.  Plenty of room for ice cream =)  Service was quick and we were in and out in 20 minutes.  I think this is a good choice if you don't want to eat a whole lot...or if you do.  There are so many options that you can make and match a meal to suit your preferences.  Just a mark down for our waitress's lack of attention to detail.",Amy S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,7/16/12,"I loved the spicy penne! Serving size was a bit small for the price, especially if you share. Overall my large group really enjoyed our dinner here.

It was really refreshing and delicious!We also ordered a cheese platter with three different cheeses. You can't really go wrong with this if you love cheese. We had a goat cheese, a gorgonzola and another that was very similar in texture and taste to a brie which we ordered simply because we had never had it, and all three along with the little sides of honey and whatnot were great. We also had the prociutto and melon appetizer which was very good. I ordered the Risotto of the day, which had a main ingredient of artichoke, which I thought was very good. It's hard to do a good risotto and get the rice just right, and this was great. Our server was very accomodating and agreed to do separate checks which, as a former server I know is a pain in the butt, but he was very gracious about it. Then we got our bill. Amazing! I'm not out in Columbus looking for somewhere to eat very often, but I would go back there if I wanted a casual and good meal. I really enjoyed Marcella's.",Julia J.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2001/5/13,"Get the melted pecorino appetizer, the pizzas are all good choices, and the chicken parm is amazing. Wait staff can be rude sometimes but the food and the area are always worth it. On weekend nights it gets really crowded and loud, need a reservation. But when the weather is warm they open the huge front windows and it is a great place to people watch and have some appetizers and a glass of wine. I recommend Marcella's to anyone I know that is coming into Columbus, and often go on dates here.",Meredith S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2010/1/12,"We had a great dinner at this restaurant over parent's weekend.  Before you go, you have to know what you're in for.  This is not Bucca Di Beppo/Olive Garden kind of food.  It is, in fact, Italian Tappas.  We (3 of us) shared a few different small plates (cheese, onions, zuccini, salad and pizza) and it was all good and fun.  We enjoyed each dish and all were served promptly (except our zuchini chips which were a bit cold and our salad which may have been forgotten and came out last but was very good).  Good drinks, too!  Total bill was very resonable but if you have a bigger party and share lots of things, I am sure it could get out of hand quickly (like all tapas restaurants).It is loud and skews to the younger set but it was fun and different and worth trying.  We'll certainly go back!",Jonathan P.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2008/3/14,"I was looking for a nice restaurant to take my daughter, her boyfriend and father. We wanted Italian and Yelp led us here and I'm SO happy it did! I made reservations for 7:30 through Yelp's OpenTable link. We got there right about 7:30 and got seated right away. While we were looking at the menu trying to decide what to get, our waiter came to our table. He apologized for the wait and took our drink and dinner orders. We honestly had only been looking at our menus long enough to figure out what to order and didn't think they were being slow. After he left another gentleman brought us the a Melted Pecorino Cheese and Braised Veal Meatball appetizers. He said they were on the house because of our wait. We were feeling pretty special now. The service continued to be fabulous through the rest of our meal. They brought bread, warm right out of the oven bread. Drinks and dinner were served very timely. Seemingly mysteriously our bread, water and soda were refilled. The ""appetizer guy"" stopped by to check on us...everything was great we reported. We had these dishes for dinner, all of them fabulous! Linguine & Clams, Chicken Parmesan, Chicken Marsala (which they happily gave me a half order), and Fettuccine & Meatball. Even though we were all pretty full because we ate all our dinners, we ordered a couple desserts to try: Cherry Crustada and Tiramisu. Both were also excellent. The only thing that could have made the meal any better would be some acoustic work in the room to keep the noise level lower. We would definitely go again!",Kate S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,6/30/09,"I've been to Marcella's four times now, the first being a few weekends right after it opened.  That was by far the worst experience of the bunch...we had to wait nearly an hour for a table even though we had a reservation!  That being said, since then, we haven't had any problems getting seated so I chalk that initial experience up to growing pains.  My most recent visit was this past Saturday night after Comfest.  They seated a large group of us at about 11:30 p.m. without complaint.  I believe the kitchen may have been open late that night due to Comfest.  As for the food, I think it is pretty average to be honest.  I've tried their risotto, pizza, gnocchi, and a few other dishes as well and haven't been blown away by anything to date.  My favorite thing to order is the bruschetta appetizer.  Compared to some of the other Cameron Mitchell restaurants such as M and Cap City (both of which I very much enjoy), I find Marcella's to be just another good (but not great) Italian restaurant.",Sabrina H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,1/27/11,"I recently won a bet with a friend.  Wager?  Loser treats the winner to dinner.  It was time to make him pay.  Literally.We decided we'd each skip lunch and eat early at 400pm.  I was a bit surprised when our server -- Erica, who was great -- told us that a significant number of menu items were half off due to happy hour.  Because I wasn't paying the bill, I brushed aside any talk of reduced fare foods.  We ordered a few drinks each.  I made sure to load up on creamy-centered arancini, the soft, giant veal meatball, delicious cheeses, fresh olives, and a simple but flavorful pizza.  Our server checked up on us several times and was happy to put in more food requests when I was ready to inflate the final total. Of course, I wasn't finished.  The beef tenderloin filet was an entree I've always wanted to try.  Since money was clearly no object for this meal, it was a foregone conclusion that I'd finally be able to sample it.  I'm happy to report it nearly melted in my mouth.  The pitcher of fruity sangria we ordered with our entrees just added to the experience.  Erica even refilled our wine glasses when she noticed them getting low.No meal at Marcella's is ever complete without one of their hefty slices of rich tiramisu.  Paired with a glass of dessert wine, it was the perfect ending to a gluttonous evening.  Our bill -- er, excuse me, *his* bill -- ended up being slightly north of $200; however, because of all the happy hour goodness, it ended up being just a little over $100.  I think he got off a bit easy.  Given all the food and drinks we ordered, this final cost was surprisingly low.While Marcella's does get fairly busy and noisy during the dinner hours, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, I've always found the food and service to be great with only one or two isolated exceptions.  So after this dining experience, two new things were learned.  Marcella's happy hour specials are well worth the trip; and, don't ever lose a bet with me!",Brian S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2011/2/11,"Had dinner here with my wife and a bunch of friends. The service was very good, and the bar served up some great drinks. We sat down at a large table for 6 and ordered the iron pot of warm olives and calamari. My wife never usually eats a lot of meat dishes but she polished off the Chicken Giardiniera, and I had the veal. It was pretty busy because of OSU football Saturday, but the food came out fast. Food was fantastic! Waitress was funny, and made sure we had everything we needed.",Jeff S.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,4/27/14,"Typically a fan of Cameron Mitchell restaurants but the service was awful. They were bus, but after taking our order, we waiting over an hour for our food and were never asked if we wanted a second round of drinks. After mistakes in our orders, the food was just ok but not worth the poor service. Definitely done with this restaurant.",R S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,11/18/08,"Let me open by saying that there was not a single dish at Marcella's that I didn't like. And I tried A LOT of dishes.For my birthday I wanted to go someplace nice. Someplace I could dress up, go out with a few close friends, and have a great experience, not just great food. I found that Marcella's fit that expectation perfectly.A lot of people on hear complain about the noise or atmosphere of Marcella's. Notice I stated above that I wasn't looking for a quiet place to eat with friends, just nice. Marcella's felt busy even for a Monday night, and yes, there was the din of other people, music, espresso machine, plates being passed around and glasses clinking to toasts being made. But all of that fit in nicely and allowed my group of friends to still be the rambunctious group we've grown up to become. My only complaint about the layout is that for a place where so many different plates of food are ordered and passed around, the table surface area is inadequate.The waitress and servers were okay. Our water was refilled with haste at every opportune time and were asked if we wanted refills for our Sangria. But that's about where the extended hospitality ended. When food was brought out, plates were just handed off at the end of the table with no effort to find the proper owner. When asked what kind of wine they used in the Sangria, the waitress couldn't produce the name, though did tell us everything else in it. When checks came, items were switched around and she did not split up the Sangria onto two checks like she offered to. But what's money amongst friends during a celebration? These things were the only clouds on an otherwise wonderful night.I wouldn't say that the food was the best food hands down that I've ever experienced, but everything was good. Unquestionably good. Everything that went into my mouth that night did not need to be mulled over about complexities or intentions. There was no art to the food, but everything was, for lack of any other descriptor, good.Our party started out with cheese plates (3 for $10 or 5 for $15), meats, small plates ($4 - $6) or appetizers ($6 - $9). The theme of the dinner was set by the massive passing around of plates and forks as each of us tried something new and different. The Prosciutto and Melon is a must, as is the Veal Meatball. When the time came, some of us ordered entrees while others ordered more small plates. I had the Goat's Cheese Ravioli ($12) and was floored by the amount of taste in such a boring looking dish. I tried the lasagna and the gnocchi, both of which were good but I felt I made the right decision.Desserts are reasonably priced at only $5 each and after dinner coffees at $3. I had the Profiteroles, and the chocolate sauce was thick and rich. A friend enjoyed a Caffe Caramello and commented that the sweet cream was a perfectly executed ending to the drink.Personal experience may vary, and I'm sure a good part of the night's pleasure stemmed from being surrounded by friends. The small prices on dishes is deceptive, as you'll want to try a few small dishes as well as order an entree, and you certainly can't pass on dessert or at least a coffee. Our table of 6 spent at least $250 on food and drink, but we left with full bellies and a general feeling of satisfaction.In conclusion, if you are looking for a private and personalized dining experience, this is not the Cameron Mitchell restaurant for you. If you want some place to enjoy the company of friends while sharing seriously good Italian food without sacrificing the quality that you would at a place like Buca di Bepo, than you should come to Marcella's.",Lisa S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,9/28/08,"I love that every review of Marcella's is centered around an explanation that it is a tapas restaurant and all that that entails.  In my experience, it entails you overpaying for small portions of bar snacks, ideally while drinking enough to make that a tolerable proposition.  With that out of the way, here is what I actually have to say about the restaurant I am reviewing:This is a review of Marcella's happy hour, 4-6 p.m. on weekdays.  Basically, it's great.  Pizzas are $4 (regularly $11 - see what I'm saying about overpaying?).  Caponata is another good option (I ask for bread with it) at $3.  A liter of sangria goes a long way, and sets you back just $8 (instead of $26).  Marcella's top-shelf twist on the Manhattan, that quintessential American cocktail, is just what the lawyer ordered and just $4.  For 2 hours every weekday, Marcella's is a refreshing and reasonable drink + snack option.  The rest of the time - it's tapas.",Kenley M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2011/2/11,"Located in a very trendy part of town.  I ordered the steak.  The waitress said oh boy you are going to love the steak.  And well I didn't so much.  It Was average, the service was average.  Nothing to get too excited about.",Gerrit L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2008/7/11,"I have been here too many times to count. I absolutely love this restaurant. Most recently I went for my birthday.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,3/21/11,"I always have a good time at Marcella, and it's a great pace to bring a large group (in my experience).  I am a big fan of their menu and quality of food.  The only negative aspect that I experience here is perhaps the promptness and/or quality of service.  Don't get me wrong, every single one of the servers I've ever had here has been super nice and personable, but sometimes I feel like they are maybe a tad undertrained or get too caught up with other tables.  All in all though, this does not outweigh what a truly solid restaurant this is....Marcella's never disappoints.",Stephanie E.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2001/5/9,"When the Polaris location opened last December, I wanted to wait to go to Marcella's in the Short North first, but I succumbed to the urge and went for lunch. We had worked up a hunger from Christmas shopping and there's nothing like a belly full of pasta and red wine on a frigid day. The restaurant just opened that week, so it was quiet and the staff was still feeling their way around. The bar is reminiscent of an Italian bistro, but the dining room has a much cozier ""rustica"" feeling, which we all immediately took to. I also dig the Italian rustic homestyle menu. I'm a big fan of small plates and found the selections were creative and varied. The bruschetta was fabulous- and I don't even like tomatoes! Overall, I got a good vibe and a fantastic bowl full of penne arrabiatta. A few months later, I still hadn't been to Marcella's in the Short North, but when I went to the Food & Wine Affair, a few of Cameron Mitchell's chefs were featuring tastes of various entrees... of all the fabulous places represented at the event, Marcella's was by far my favorite- hand's down. They had me at Gnocchi con Bolognese! I went back for 3 or 4 servings and shortly after found myself once again having at Marcella's (Polaris) ordering the gnocchi for dinner. The chef even came out to chat after I raved on and on about it.Gnocchi is a tricky thing and can go either way, which is why I often hesitate to order this as a full entree, but I knew otherwise. Marcella's gnocchi is perfectly cooked and the braised lamb marinara sauce is currently one of my top 2 Italian dishes in Columbus. Over time, I've tasted of several other entrees and ordered a few flatbread pizzas at the bar, all of which were great tasting. All of my dining experiences have lived up to what my expectation is of Cameron Mitchell restaurants- consistantly good food, creative concepts and solid service. I found our servers and bartenders to be friendly and attentive, despite the place being a total zoo one Friday night. The age group of patrons seem to be mixed depending on the time of day/night. This particular Marcella's strikes me as the sort of place you go to have drinks and dinner in a lively setting, not so much for carousing.  I do know they have carry out, because I've ordered several meals to go.In an area as overloaded with chain restaurants and mall food courts as Polaris is, Marcella's Ristorante is a shining star. I highly recommend lunch and dinner at either locations. Weekends at the Polaris Marcella's can become very crowded, but I've never had much of a wait for lunch- except during this holiday shopping season, but just grab a carafe of wine and sit tight!  It's well worth the wait.",Shawnie K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,12/30/08,"Can someone tell me why there are so many Italian restaurants in the United States? And why do they vary so widely? On one hand you have the supremely expensive neuvo-Italian type places with 4 items on the menu ranging from cuttlefish to rare mushrooms. On the other hand you have the greasy pizza joints that mysteriously serve not only bad pizza but french fries and grinders too(whatever they are). All classified as Italian restaurants.Do we as Americans love Italian food that much? What is it, the tomatoes, the cheese? Well, dear reader, let me tell you. I've been to Italy quite a few times. Italians don't love American food as much as we love Italian food. But I digress. Maybe we like to imagine ourselves in a more exotic place like Italy (it's really not that exotic but bear with me). So with that in mind, we put on our finest clothes, meet with our finest friends, and go to a fine dining establishment like Marcella's. And viola! We're instantly transported to that exotic place eating fine Italian cuisine or so we think.All told, Marcella's falls squarely just above the middle of Italian restaurants being significantly better than Olive Garden, enormously better than Tony's Pizza and Wings, but not better than a truly family-run small place with the Italian-speaking grandma in the back preparing meals from all real ingredients. And obviously nothing will touch actually eating in a small ristorante just off the Piazza di Navonna.This place looks cool, is crowded, even on a Tuesday, the staff is friendly, and the food is good. But still, it's chain. and you can taste it in the food. it's just not quite as good as you would hope it to be. I sampled a wide-range of the items on the menu, from the cheese, to the anchioves, to the bruschetta and the gelato. All good but not fantastic. Bonus fact: Prices are reasonable.So prance off to Marcella's, even indulge yourself with valet parking. You'll enjoy but it's not the real deal.And yes, I'm a snob.",Clubber Lang ..,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,7/28/11,"We love this place. Their happy hour cannot be beat. We come here a lot for happy hour. Half price cocktails, wine, appetizers, and pizzas. My favorites are the cheese plate, the anchovies, the pizzas, the gnocci, the carbonara....pretty much everything on the menu is delicious. I grew up in the heart of great Italian food and this is the first place in Columbus I have found to satisfy my craving.",Katie A.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,9/27/10,"I like Marcella's, I've been here twice... but if I could I'd rather give it 3.5 stars.I came here with a group of 15+ people on a Sunday evening around 6:30pm. I have no clue why it was packed, but there were people filling the waiting area...it was kind of ridiculous. Anyway, I had no problem with my reservation, which was great. But the service was a little finicky. Two meals never came out, after repeated assurance to the my guests that they would be. Instead, I think they took it off their ticket and placed them as to-go orders. I got the calamari --which was pretty salty and oily, and had very little calamari in it. The cheese board--which was delicious as always, mmm! And shared the gnocchi---however, the dumplings were pretty mushy and resembled more like clumps of mash potato in some kind of stew. Also, it was kind of interesting because three people at my table ordered the gnocchi and all of our plates looked a little different. Some looked more substantial than others, fresher looking dumplings and cubes of lamb vs my stew plate.In the future I would not go here with a large group. Keep it to six so that you can enjoy the people watching, share the excellent small platters (the highlight of Marcella's), and share the bottles of wine that are 25% off on Sundays!",Aris Y.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2002/10/9,"Is it alright to describe meat as melt in your mouth, or should that be reserved for candy coated chocolates? Aw heck, who cares - the meatballs here are MELT IN YOUR MOUTH! Simply amazing!The calamari is a yummy starter too, however I got a fried lemon slice in one bite and kinda wanted to gag.Oh and to end the meal, splurge - Go for the tiramisu. You won't regret it, I promise.Overall, I love Marcella's. I love the atmosphere and that it is the plate sharing sort of place. I love that they pour the wine the carafes at the table, and I love that they open all of the glass front and side in the summer. So cute and so yummy!",Mandy M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2002/5/9,"Last night my friend and I decided to grab some dinner and then go see a movie. We wanted to try something different and I've actually never been to Marcella's before. So we stopped in. Bad idea.Let me start off by saying that Marcella's is a nice restaurant and there's nothing wrong with it. But it wasn't at all what we were expecting. I had no idea that it was a tapas kind of place. I'm going to go ahead and recommend this place to couples. If you're out with your lady or man, come here, it'll be perfect. But with a friend it was a little weird. Marcella's is all about little shareable appetizer foods and that might be fun with a group or with a couple. Why? Because if one person gets the bill, no problem. If several people all pitch in, fine. And yes, my friend and I could have easily split the bill. But we didn't exactly have the same tastes. So this obviously wasn't going to work for us.So we found a spot on the street. No, there's no great places to park around here, and consider yourself lucky if you get a spot on the street in front. We had to walk about two blocks which wasn't fun in the bitter cold sliding on the solid ice sidewalk. At least it was nice and warm in Marcella's.A hostess greeted us and took us way to the back of the restaurant because it looked pretty crowded up by the front. We were seated at a 4 person table so I had an extra chair to throw my coat and purse on, which is always nice. Our waitress came right up and filled our glasses with water and brought us menus. She went over practically everything on the menu for us and left us to our own devices. We felt like idiots, but we were still confused. The menu consisted of these different sections: Olives, Cheese, Meats, Small Plates, Appetizers, Pizzas, Pastas. What? Basically, it was different. Which was fine. But we didn't really want to share appetizers or eat pizza. Aside from that, pasta dishes were our only options. Don't get me wrong, these appetizers and meal fragments sounded great. But it seemed pretty expensive to try all the things you'd want with just two people, especially if we didn't have the same taste. A couple with similar tastes would definitely do better here, but I think it would also be fun for a bigger group. I wanted to try some of the appetizers, but we both decided pasta would be our best bet. Besides, we had a movie to catch.So I ordered the Ravioli Mezzaluna. One glance at the menu and I knew that dish was for me. My friend can be picky and I don't even know what she did. She wanted some gnocchi dish but she wanted the garlic sauce of another dish instead of marinara sauce. The waitress seemed to understand and said that would be fine. So we waited and they brought out some sliced bread and poured us a little dish of olive oil and grated some parmesan cheese on top. It was pretty good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the bread. It was tough and chewy. Much better with the oil.We didn't have to wait too long for our food to come out. Our server told us the food was fast here and we probably only waited 15 minutes. But dishes looked very nice and smelled delicious. I dug right in to mine. Oh my gosh it was great! Only one other time have I had ravioli that good (the other was at a very expensive restaurant in D.C.). The ravioli was big - about twice or three times the size of your typical ravioli. It was filled with goat cheese (which is delicious) and cooked with cabbage, mushrooms and little pieces of bacon. The sauce was great - it was a brown sauce that tasted like a wine sauce. I loved it. I ate it all. Devoured it. But really, the serving size wasn't all that big. There were only 4 pieces of ravioli. It was the perfect amount of food to leave room for dessert. But I do like to have some food to take home later. That wasn't going to happen here. And my pasta dish was $12. Not too bad, but a little pricey for a meal that leaves you just a little unsatisfied as far as hunger. I mean, I was fine, but I could have eaten more.And as for my friend's food, they screwed it all up. But she didn't want to say anything for some reason. She got her gnocchi, but there were big tomatoes in it, I'm not sure if that was the wrong sauce. And there was no meat at all! She specifically said to the server that she wanted lamb and there was no lamb. She really should have said something but didn't. She still liked it and I tried a piece of the gnocchi and it was pretty good, although I don't think I could eat a whole plate of it. I definitely ordered the right thing, but I think they dropped the ball on my friend's food. Nevertheless, she should have spoken up about it - I'm sure they would have fixed it. But our issue was that we were on a time constraint.We considered dessert because they all looked so good, but our server was spotty towards the end so we ran out of time and just had to get the check. She put it on one but we had her split it. I'll have to try this place again with Jeff so we can share foods!",Stephanie B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,11/22/11,"Just doesn't do it for me.  Food is mediocre, and unfortunately I've had some terrible service experiences.  It is usually a lively scene, which I guess is good.  But in terms an Italian restaurant, don't expect tasty fare.",Randy J.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,11/16/13,"Wish I could do 3.5 instead of 3. I love, love, love the food at Marcella's but, I always run into a problem with reservations running behind. The food at Marcella's is fantastic. The happy hour specials are, in my opinion, the best in the city. I strongly recommend the melted pecorino for a starter and depending on your mood the margherita pizza or chicken parmesan. I have had about 75% of the things on the menu and have yet to come across something I didn't not like. This is a great spot to meet with co-workers or friends after work. Now on to the down sides. First, the restaurant is VERY loud and gets louder as the night goes on. It does give off a lively vibe but, it's no fun to yell at the person across the table. Also, the wait staff can seem a little annoyed sometimes, I've noticed this more with happy hour than dinner. And, now, my absolute biggest pet peeve about Marcella's...they always run behind on reservations. People make reservations for a reason.  However, I have never been seated immediately or even in less than five minutes no matter my reservation time.  I made a reservation over a week ago for 6:15 on a Saturday as I was attending a concert that began at 8 at Nationwide Arena. Upon arriving at 6:10 I was told that the reservations were running 20 minutes behind. 6:30 was available when I made my reservation and there is a reason I did not choose it. Unfortunately, this night, waiting wasn't an option so we wound up at Steak Escape. :(. Also, the waiting area is non-existent, prepare to get intimate with other waiting guests!So, while I do love the food at Marcella's I will not go back again if I actually have somewhere to be afterward. But, if you are not operating on a schedule and can afford to wait, check this place out!",Stacy S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,1/16/09,"The best time to go to here is in the summer. My favorite feature of this restaurant are the full windows that extend and open during warm weather.I recently went here and without the warm air wafting in, it just wasn't the same!The menu is based on the idea of eating family style, ordering a few things and sharing. This is a common concept but the dishes and portions could be better if you choose to go this route.Having tried everything from the appetizers to the veal, you are guaranteed to walk away satisfied with the pizzas they have several creations and they are great for sharing along with the fresh salads and sangria.",doreen w.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,1/30/08,"While this may indeed be the best pizza in Columbus (no offense to Bexley Pizza Plus, but much to all those fans of the greasy processing of Donatos, Adriaticos, Papa Johns) the atmosphere could use a little work.  Hip and trendy, great food, but simply too loud.Went with my family on Christmas Eve and enjoyed the fried calamari a great deal, along with the wonderful fresh italian bread with butter.  For our pizza options we opted for Margherita, Funghi and Taleggio, and Shrimp Pesto.  While all 3 pizzas were great and the cheeses were fresh, sharp, and well melted the crust really stood out due to its thin and crispy texture.  The tomato sauce was great and the pesto was incredible, but the garlic sauce on the Funghi was a bit much (and I'm a pretty huge garlic fan.)For dessert, the Tiramisu was terribly overrated and nowhere near the quality of other Columbus establishments.  Tiramisu is a dish I get at every restaurant that offers it and I must say this is in the bottom 25% of those sampled.  On the otherhand, the Profiterole's were absolutely stellar, on par with those at far more expensive restaurants in much more culinary cities - The dish, additionally, was enormous.For the price, Marcella's may be one of the best options in all of Columbus.  Great, fresh food in large portions........if only the place were a little more quiet and had a better Tiramisu.  On my next visit I believe I'll sample some of the cheese tasting menu and the other dishes besides the pizza.",Michael U.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2001/12/9,"This is a really wonderful little place to eat. It opened 5 months before I moved to Boston and quickly became the place I went when anyone wanted to get some food.The small plates are wonderful and the rustic feel of the restaurant and the dishes is perfect. I love the open store front during the summer!The meatball is fantastic, the proscuitto e melone is head over heels fabulous and the pizzas are fantastic too.I really love tapas style food. Little plates just make me a whole lot happier than a huge chunk of meat with some version of starch and a tiny bit of veggies. The variety of food you can get is fantastic, especially with the amount of money you're spending. Another triumphant Cameron Mitchell endeavor. If I've said it once, I've said it a million times: Columbus, be thankful for your restauranteur, he knows what he's doing!!",Andra G.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2006/9/8,"I've been to Marcella's only once so far, but can't wait to go back.  We went for my birthday in January, had a reservation for 12 people, which ended up being 13 instead.  Our server was fantastic!  I wish I remembered her name, because I really can not say enough good things about her; the girl was cheerful, prompt, organized, etc.  She did not mess up a single thing any of us ordered, even though we arrived at different times, and kept ordering drinks and small plates.  She even climbed up on a chair to take a picture of all 13 of us with our shots of limoncello.  She was perfect!Quite honestly, everything was perfect.  Maybe it's easier for me to say that because it was my birthday and I didn't pay for anything; when I go back on my own dime, I might have to write an addendum that addresses value proportional to cost.We ordered lots of small plates - chesses and olives were all wonderful, some folks had calamari, which I think they enjoyed, but a good portion of our group was vegetarian (including myself).  We had a vegetable pizza that was absolutely heavenly - peppery arugula, bits of sauteed zuchini, onions, tomatoes, I don't even remember what else, thin crisp crust.  I tried some gnocchi, some sort of ravioli, and other things I'm forgetting.  Everything was very, very good.Drinks were wonderful.  We had lots of wine, the limoncello I mentioned before (less syrupy sweet than it is at Buca de Beppo, the only other place I've tried it, and I like Marcella's better), and some fancy drinks.  The Strawberry-Balsamic Martini sounds odd, but tastes fantastic!We also had desserts; I sampled someone's gelato, and one of my friends insisted on buying me a slice of tiramisu for my birthday, which our server was good enough to box up since I couldn't have eaten another bite.  When I ate it two days later, it was still ambrosia.As far as atmosphere goes, it's great for groups but some people might find it a bit loud and/or crowded for their liking.  I also love the way the windows out front can be opened like doors to give patio style seating in the summer; I hope I can sit out there soon and enjoy some more great food.And one last thing - I'm not always such a fan of Cameron Mitchell's restaurants, but this one I absolutely will go back to!",Emily A.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,7/26/10,"Whether joined by friends or your significant other, Marcella's Ristorante in Short North is a top-tier choice for satisfying those frequent Italian cravings. In terms of food, what this place does well is draw your attention to the better parts of Italian cuisine. Regardless of what appetizer or entree I've tried, my impression, to put it simply, is that the focus is on getting straight to the good stuff, in reasonable portions, and absent any unnecessary filler. My last visit was no disappointment. To start, the melted pecorino cheese was fantastic. It's a mix of crustini, apple slices, honey, and of course, a quality melted pecorino cheese. It's the real deal. For the main course I chose the ravioli mezzaluna. It was impressive and the mushrooms made the dish. With all that said about the food, what make the restaurant are the people and environment, both of which are vibrant in a way that mirror Short North itself. Weather permitting, I'd recommend taking a seat at one of the high-tops in the front of the restaurant by the large open window. You'll be immersed with all things Short North without loosing the charm of the restaurant or the solid Italian experience it provides.",Larry L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,4/30/11,Pure awesome.  One of my favorite places.  Ravioli Mezzaluna FTW.  More than half the time the server disappears for 15 minutes when we're waiting on our bill.  Really the only complaint.  Better than Polaris location.,Jazz M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,9/30/08,"My best friend's bachelorette party devolved into a day of eating, and so we thought that small plates might be a good solution for saving room for drinks later on.  Having planned this event from the other side of the country, I was encouraged that the local ladies were very enthusiastic about my choice of restaurant.  Having made several trips to Columbus over the years, I also knew it would be tough to go wrong with a Cameron Mitchell establishment.Ordering a few items each, we were still shocked by our overwhelmed table and our equally overwhelmed bellies.  There was resounding enthusiasm for the giant meatball, our wide variety of salads and just about anything that was served with cheese.  I've had better arancini, but it was easy to look beyond that brief disappointment.We attempted to hold back and not order dessert, but after a night of great service including tolerance for our ever-changing reservation, our waitress brought out a round of profiteroles on the house to honor of our bride-to-be.  How could we say no to intensely flavored chocolate, vanilla and pistachio ice cream?  Certainly we needed to top things off with a round of espresso drinks before moving on with our evening.",Megan K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2011/1/8,"I'm a fan!  Crazy busy place.  Make a reservation, although it might now do any good.  It's probably easier to try to squeeze in between someone else's.  It's a great place for groups, but it's loud and filled to the brim with action.  Not entertainment, just with servers, and patron's and food, and plates and food and food and food.  My goodness, there's always food on the table.They do serve entree's but the small plates are what has created such a buzz.  My favorite's that you must try are: veal braised meatball-don't share!  get your own!  The zucchini parmesan, is made with full, roasted garlic cloves and grated parmesan cheese.  The Insalata con Rucola is such a light and refreshing 'meal' after your 'taste' of the other small plates.  Two wonderful drinks are the white sangria and the Limoncella Frizzante.  Also, both are very light and refreshing!Every meal is served with fresh baked, white bread and olive oil.  Just in case you had a spare minute or moment of hunger, I suppose.",Ellen F.,,,,,,

The sunday special features their famous meatballs. Awesome! I am not a huge pasta fan but the sauce and the fact that you can eat this spaghetti & meatball dish with a fork rather than twirling says something. The sauce is robust and the entire dish is more like a casserole than a plate of pasta. No room for dessert? No worries! Take that tiramisu home with you. It will be your best friend & wonderful reminder of the high caliber of food prepared by Marcella""s. Delicious!",AnnE B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,4/14/11,"We came into town late and hungry, and were looking for someplace that was open and looked appetizing.  As per a relative's recommendation, we made our way over to High Street and Marcella's was the first place that caught our eye.  Even though it was a Thursday night, a decent crowd suggested that the food was probably palatable.  And frankly, we were so tired and hungry we could have eaten cardboard.Surprisingly, however, Marcella's turned out to be a great find. Being from out of town, we went not expecting much, but came away with leftovers from an amazing meal:  veal braised meatball, pecorino fondue (not what it's called, but basically what it is), and capellini fra diavolo.  The meatball was gorgeous, as was the fondue, and the capellini was pretty good too. ;)The only glitch was that our waitress forgot about us for 30 min, and we had to flag down someone else to find her for us.  However, she totally made up for it by giving us an extra appetizer and our original appetizer for free!  Which made the extra wait worth it, especially since we wouldn't have had the meatball if she hadn't brought it over.Since we were there on a Thursday night, it was pretty quiet, and we got a table immediately.  It does seem like a pre-date or pre-night on the town place, since most of the people we saw in there were dressed to go out. Still, it seems like a college crowd primarily, and my brother and I were fine in our casual clothes.Definitely recommended if you're in town!",Smita B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2009/10/11,"I have been here twice now, and I am somewhat torn in how I really feel about this place. My first visit was definitely a 5-star experience. Great food, service, atmosphere, etc. all around. I went with 4 girlfriends and we had an amazing dinner. It was so relaxing and cozy inside, the bread was warm and delicious, we split a bottle of wine (a ""litro""), and we all left very happy with our entree choices. However, my second visit was not so great. It wasn't horrible by any means, but basically the glaring blemishes on the dinner were these: 1. We had a reservation. My boyfriend's parents were in town and he wanted to take them here since it was in the short north and we could walk around after eating and show them goodale park, jeni's, etc. So we made these reservations a week in advance. No problem, right? We even confirmed again the day before. All systems were go. Then we get there, even 10 minutes before our reservation, and they make us sit and wait. No big deal, we were early, so we figured we would wait a little while they got the table ready. No. We waited and waited and waited... after literally HALF AN HOUR of waiting (20 minutes PAST our reservation), my boyfriend and I asked them what was going on, and said we had a reservation at 6:30pm. They didn't apologize, and just said they would let us know when our table was ready because they were running behind and waiting for tables to open up. I'm sorry, but isn't that the POINT of a reservation?? So you DON'T wait for 45 minutes to be seated?2. After being seated and eating, etc. I got up to use the bathroom, and en route, slipped. I was wearing a dress and startled a nearby table. Apparently someone was mopping the hardwood floors or had spilled a drink or something, but it happened not once (victim being me), but TWICE throughout the night (another unidentified victim). I am going to assume they weren't mopping floors during dinner rush so I'll blame it on a spill. Come on, people. Clean up spills! Even if it's water - obviously people can still slip. How embarrassing.Apart from those, dinner was just ok. We were talked into an expensive bottle of red wine for the table which made us feel fancy, and my meal was good. My first visit I got the salmon, and the second visit I got the gnocchi bolognese. Loved both of them. I will say I think they changed the bread they serve before dinner though. And by change I mean downgraded. First visit was warm, fluffy, and a little herby. Second visit was bland, cold (yes, cold. Like from the refrigerator), and kind of hard.My boyfriend's mom got the veggie pizza and loved it. However, my boyfriend got the veal and was not impressed. Especially for the price. It looked sloppy and slathered in sauce to me, and he said it wasn't cooked that great either. His dad got the linguine and clams. It looked yummy, but he said it was waaay too garlic-y and he didn't even eat half of it. I felt bad that he didn't enjoy the meal. So maybe a third visit is in order? To be the deciding factor between one great visit and one underwhelmingly not-so-great visit. Stay tuned.",Bee S.,,,,,,

The chit chat is always at a minimum, yet very friendly and even with the small water glasses, we never went thirsty.The food is great as well.

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,12/13/07,"My company did our holiday lunch there for 88 people and everyone was VERY satisfied.  I was surprised that many people even fit in, but it's deceptively large - I never guessed how large it was from looking at the storefront.Waitstaff was great, very attentive, and kept the food coming.  Favorites for the table: the goat cheese ravioli, the Sicilian pizza, the veal meatball and sausage.  The chicken giardinera didn't go over so well.  Desserts are also excellent - the tiramisu isn't soggy and the blueberry sauce on the cheesecake is delish.We also visited on Valentine's Day.  It was very crowded (my boyfriend's chair was continuously bumped by the waitresses who, to be fair, were hustling to keep everyone happy) and there were surprisingly few couples and lots of groups.  Sangria was good, arancini was not (Pastaria Secondi at the North Market has better).  The service was pretty good and we were pleased even if it wasn't the romantic atmosphere we were hoping for.Definitely check it out, but you have to go with a group so you can excuse order lots of things and sampling everything.  It's very much worth it!",Emily H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,8/13/12,"Nice area, good vibe, and friendly, attentive service. Wine list could be deeper based broader, incl Italian.  Got steered to a dodgy Amarone when I wanted to go Brunello, after they were out of Barolo ordered. Stiill, very pleasant experience. I'd go back.",Kenneth Q.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,12/17/07,"Been here for dinner a few times (I have a condo right up the street).  It's always pretty packed but like Emily said this place is deceptively big.  Always been able to get in without a reservation.Prices are fantastic and portions are good.  Try the linguine with meatball (just one, but it's HUGE) for a taste treat.  I hope you like sharing because that's how the dishes are designed.VERY reasonable wine list.  Overall a fantastic dining experience in the heart of the Short North.",Christopher S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,9/24/12,"I really like this place.  I've been here for large parties (which I generally hate, but Marcella's handles them well), and also dinners for two.  I love their food and their wine selection.  We went on a Monday night and they had 25% off bottles of wine, so we had 4!  Just kidding.  But we did share a nice bottle of wine and enjoyed the meatball and carpaccio and then our entrees.  All was delicious and the server was really sweet and not hovering or annoying.  The tiramisu was delicious and the bathrooms were clean.  On the way out, I heard My Morning Jacket playing on the speakers.  Perfect!  Will definitely choose this place for dinner or drinks in the future.",Shirley H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,6/28/10,"I have been a fan of the Marcella's Short North location since it opened. A fun and interesting atmosphere is the perfect stop for an after work happy hour, catch up with friends or romantic dinner.Ill admit that I stick with what I like, so here is my usual menu (split between 2 people):Crostini appetizer with cheese apples and honey (unbelievable)Pizza (any kind will do!!)Pistachio Gelato (unbeatable)In conclusion, if you are looking for a night of good food, conversation and atmosphere, definitely make a trip to Marcellas!",Bradi F.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,2011/4/11,"Everyone in my circle just loves Marcella's. Prices are fair, portions large, and who doesn't love Italian food? What SUCKS hard here is it's always PACKED to the brim - like people falling out the open air windows kind of packed. No room to navigate between tables and chairs. Having a reservation at this place is completely useless because you will still end up waiting at least 20 minutes for your table, but more realistically you will wait 40 mins. So of course you have to try to maneuver your way to the bar and kill time. But you won't find anywhere to sit so have fun. Sure the open air window thing is great but wait until you're dining there on a first date and it's a bajillion degrees outside w/ 99% humidity. They NEVER shut the damn windows! They'll blast the AC but it still gets sucked out the windows as your makeup melts off your face. Not to mention the very large AC vents hang from the ceiling and if you know how condensation 101 works then you'll have little water drops randomly falling on you depending on where you are stationed. A friend of mine who is 50% Italian, speaks fluently and has been to Italy multiple times (which in my book makes him an authority on all things Italian), swears this is the most authentic Italian food in Columbus. I can't argue because I've never been to Italy. Just try to avoid this place on the weekends and super hot nights!! It's louder than most restaurants, so good luck conversing with your company.",Laura C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2001/10/11,"So... we were just passing through Columbus on our way to St. Louis, MO for the holidays when we happened upon Marcella's completely randomly.  Thank goodness we did!  My husband and I like to consider ourselves beginner foodies and have frequented some of THE best restaurants in the DC/MD/VA area, and although Marcella's is not in the same league as places such as Komi, Inn at Little Washington, etc. (some of the top rated DC area restaurants) the value can't be beat!  Our waiter was very knowlegeable and we ordered everything he recommended and loved it all.  We started with the pecorino cheese and veal meatball appetizers.  Both were delicious!  We then moved on to a caesar salad and the Sicilian pizza.  The total for the night was less than $50 and we also had wine!  You can't beat that!  We are thinking of making this trip an annual trip to MO and would definitely make it a point to stop in Columbus to go back to Marcella's!",Judy O.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,7/18/12,"Lived up to all the hype, all the expectation. A terrific meal, terrific service. Had the meatball for an appetizer, the risotto (as a side dish), gnocchi and chicken piccata. All great.",Pat C.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,2,8/22/09,"Marcella's Short North: decibel level was ABSURD, we literally could not talk to anyone except the person immediately next to us and then it was a matter of leaning over and shouting in their ear. I am not exaggerating. Noisiest restaurant I've ever been in. I would have turned around at the door if the restaurant hadn't been the choice of someone I barely knew -- who, it turned out, had also never eaten there but only gotten carry out. The food was inconsistent -- caprese salad was excellent, gnocchi was mushy, teens liked the pizza and fried risotto, potato dumplings in the soup were doughy, tomato sauce was oversweet -- and definitely nothing to make it worth it to deal with the noise.",Val T.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,3/15/09,Was in Columbus OH for biz and me and a couple of co workers decided to stop in to have dinner. I have to say the decor was very nice and atmosphere very romantic a good place to bring that special some one. The service was good. Our server was very attentive and the food was not bad. The bill wasn't bad either. The only one issue was that I was billed twice. The next day I was checking my account and saw two charges. I called Marcella's and spoke to the manager Dennis. He was very nice and resolved the issue very quickly and on top of that sent me a $25 gift card. All I have to say is WOW that is excellent customer service.,Ken B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,6/25/09,"I found Marcella's to be surprisingly authentic.  By authentic, all I mean is that I spent a summer in Florence once, and eating here reminded me of food there.  Really tasty dishes, decent wine list, great prices.  One of my favorite Italian spots in Columbus.",Wesley B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2002/1/12,Bright and buzzing spot. The food is well executed. But somehow it doesn't make one feel like an insider like most good Columbus places do.,B F.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2001/10/12,"Being stupid college students, my friends and I took a very large group-about 10 people- to Marcella's on a gallery hop night.  Although we made a reservation, we of course had to wait.  The restaurant just isn't made to accommodate ten person parties.  After we sat down, however, the experience was absolutely incredible.  The restaurant is nice yet affordable, especially if you want to split plates, which they don't mind at all.  I think the most any member of our group spent was about $23, and he got an appetizer, full plate, and dessert.  I had the  ravioli mezzaluna, prepared vegetarian, after seeing positive reviews about it on yelp.  Despite the size of our group, the plate arrived quickly and steaming.  Unfortunately, they didn't make it vegetarian, but it was replaced even more quickly and taken off our bill, and it was absolutely outstanding once we dug in.  All the desserts our group got and shared were phenomenal as well, and so was the cheese platter I split with a few friends.  Definitely, definitely recommended, and I will absolutely be back, albeit with a smaller group.",Rachel C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2010/11/9,"I have been to Marcella's twice now and each time has been excellent. Having traveled to Italy, I can say that this is the closest thing to ""authentic"" Italian food that I've had in the city. I especially like the mismatched plates and dishtowels as napkins. It's a very lively atmosphere, so you'll need to speak up a bit to converse with the other people at your table. I've had the spaghetti and the pizza, both of which were well prepared and heavy on the garlic (the way I like it). The wine list is extensive and the markup isn't terrible. Really you can't go wrong with this place.",Ben C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2008/6/8,"WARNING: If you are claustrophobic and are expecting Chicken Alfredo you may want to go to Olive Garden across the street. This review is for the new location on Polaris Pkwy (the old Martini's). Marcella's is a cool concept and I realize people have complained about the portion sizes but it's a tapas restaurant. Everything is meant to be shared (AKA take 1 or 2 bites as it's passed around). You're supposed to sample a few different items and slowly get filled up as time passes. The music and fast pace create a social atmosphere in my mind. It is not good for families at night in my opinion especially ones with small kids. Tables are close together but not nearly as close together as the ones on High Street. Great drinks, maybe a little pricey but it's all top shelf liquor. Overall, a solid restaurant and every person I have taken there has absolutely loved the food so I thikn that says a lot.NOTE: Outdoor seating is available at the Polaris Pkwy location.",Rebecca R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2003/7/11,"First time in Columbus, OH and I was only there for the Arnold Classic. Just before going to the Figure, Bikini, and female Bodybuilding show we stopped in to Marcells's for some food. The menu was interesting but nothing really stood out to us given our time contraint. Just before placing out order we said to Julia (waitress) that we were in a rush. She said that she understands. An eternity passed before we got our food, but Julie was sooo sweet I felt really bad. It was totally out of her control as a large order was placed right before ours. She gave us a gift card and comped out meal that night for the inconvenience. We decided to go back there again the follow day for lunch to use our GC. We were fortunate enough to have Julia as our waitress again. She was very nice, and very attentive. Overall the experience was awesome. The pizza was delicious, the ambience was fun and the music was great. I won't be in Columbus again until next year for the same show, but I'll be sure to go to Marcella's when I do.",O D.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2008/3/8,"Marcellas is a fun little tapas restaurant concept.  I see a lot of people dogging on it in here over some prices and some service issues, and those are reasonable gripes.  But the key to having a fun experience in a place like this is to know that it is a food-in-the-middle-of-the-table kind of place.  Picky eaters beware, you may have to try something new.  We always order a bunch of stuff we want to try first and call that an appetizer.  Everything comes out on wooden planks and goes on a rack on the table and is real easy to just pass around.  Whatever we haven't gotten yet that still sounds good gets called the main course.  And as for desert, I recommend the Manhattan on the bottom right hand corner of the drink menu.",Nathan L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,4/20/08,"Marcella's is worth trying if you want to eat in the Short North.While everything was good it didn't make us jump out of our seats.  I was a little disappointed that the Veal was not accompanied with anything.  Plus charging $18 for breaded veal with marinara on top is ridiculous, I could have made the same dish at home for around $5.The entree portions aren't that large, not for sharing unless you're starting with a couple hot/cold plates (which all looked good  passing by our table).Our server was excellent and the entire staff was friendly.We had made a reservation and we're seated immediately regardless of the wait, I was really impressed and thankful for this.I could see myself returning here if girlfriends wanted to hop around the short north and start with tapas.  But if my goal was to enjoy delicious Italian food I would go to Romanos Macaroni Grill in Dublin which is much more flavorful and reasonably priced for portion size.",Meredith M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,7/27/08,"Food is good, if a little overpriced.  I'm giving it 3 stars because of service.  I felt a little like we were putting the wait staff out, and they kept bringing us the wrong things.  Plus, there were 9 of us, the bill was $400 and they didn't even ask us if we wanted them to split it up.  Thanks for nothing.  I will concede that the Tiramasu is the best I've ever had and it's worth going there just for that.",Laura R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,9/30/07,"Small plates/tapas style restaurant and one of the newest Cameron Mitchell restaurant offerings. Hip, contemporary and decent food (depending on what you get).

Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,5,2001/9/10,"We love this restaurant. This is my husband's and my favorite date restaurant. Definitely loud and boisterous, but you feel like you are where it is at. I love the atmosphere and the food is delicious. We always get the zucchini chips, parmesean crusted onions, risotto balls for appetizers...And then for dinner we usually share a dish. Some of our favorite main dishes are the fettuccini and amazing meatball, Chicken gardaneria (or something like that), the goat cheese ravoili is so good and the chilcken parmesean is probably the best chicken parm I have ever had. If you can save room for dessert. I think Marcella's has the best desserts in the short north. The profiteroles are amazing, the cherry cobbler so good...good selection. We love coming here and starting with a cocktail and then picking a wine. It is always one of our first choice of restaurants...and when we choose not to come here it is becuase we had just been there recently. I have also attended a bachelorette party here which worked perfect and brought my mom and dad here when they were in town. Always a hit!...",Suzanne L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,3,10/16/08,"We visited the Polaris location for a late weekday lunch.  I really wanted to give this place four stars but the food didn't quite make it.  Decor and service were both very nice.  We started with glasses of wine.  They have a good selection.  A few are reasonably priced.  It seemed that 1/2 to 3/4 of the list was overpriced.  To start we had the Caponata, which was excellent, and the zucchini ""small plates.  I think they tried to do a zucchini ""potato chip"".  It didn't work.  The zucchini was limp and dry.  Next we ordered Lasagna alla Bolognese.  What a disappointment.  The Bolognese tested like ground beef and nothing else.  I noticed they also had a lamb bolognese.  I asked if I could get fettucini with the lamb bolognese (not on the menu).  No problem.  The lamb bolognese was excellent.  The fettucini was a little over cooked but the real problem I had was with the portion size.  It was small.  This was listed under ""pasta"" not ""small plates"" so I expected more.  The lasagna was a normal sized portion.  I ordered a decaf espresso.  They were out of decaf.  We will probably go back to this place but will be more careful what we order next time.  I compared the lunch and dinner menus online. They look identical except the prices are higher for dinner.  I wonder if the portions are any larger for dinner?",Tim K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Columbus,555,4,4,2012/10/7,"My first great culinary experience in Columbus!  I kept hearing about how Columbus is a great food town, but Marcella's is the first place where I can see how the city got such a reputation.  I had the lamb shank with white bean ragu - fantastic!  Staff was helpful in pairing wine.  We made a reservation - which is a must - and still waited a few minutes for a table in the bar.  This and the bar atmosphere are what keep me from giving 5 stars, but the food is excellent.",Alicia F.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,2010/11/17,"Marcella's is, of course, famous for the meatball. You can get it as an appetizer with marinara sauce, or it comes on some of the pasta dishes. And you can add it to any entree for $5!At lunchtime Marcella's has a really great burger. It might seem strange to order a burger here, but it was an excellent choice! I was actually disappointed when I went for dinner once and found out the burger is only on the lunch menu. I love the crispy potato pizza! It took a while, but I finally discovered that their alfredo sauce is made with a kick. I had tried the fettuccine and meatball which comes with both marinara and alfredo sauces. I thought the marinara had a kick, so the next time I ordered a tortellini alfredo. Boom. Alfredo has a kick, so now I avoid it. It was unexpected!On our most recent visit the food took a little long to come out, and Marcella's made sure we were well taken care of and left happy. We could tell that service is really important to them.Be sure to visit the restrooms for some mouthwash and other fancy offerings.",Valerie C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,2009/11/17,"Always a lovely place to go for GREAT happy hour prices. It's in the middle of Polaris Parkway and near a lot of shops, so if you're hungry from shopping...stop by and grab some cheap cocktails and delicious appetizers.I've tried all of their cocktail drinks and my favorite is probably the Whisky Rosso. There's a kick to it but at the same time it's got a sweet aftertaste. The strawberry balsamic martini is one of the other favorites on the cocktail list.Their calamari is always my go to dish to order, along with the meatballs! Absolutely tasty and packs a great flavor. The portion for the cheese bread is plentiful, I feel like I always order way too much food. Simply because it's hard to resist not taking a bite out of all their appetizers.Seating is always easy for me, but if you have a big party - makes sure to get there early to get a table for your party. They can easily accommodate your requests. The staff is always very quick and friendly.",David T.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,2,8/29/17,"""I'd really rather just never go back there again."" - what I said to my husband as soon as we walked through the doors.Giving this place 2 stars because it was edible and it was kinda sorta like they tried to make the meals look appetizing. We went in at 8 pm last night because we were hungry, in no mood to cook when we got home, and wanted to try somewhere different. I was in the mood for Italian. They weren't busy, maybe 4 other tables in the main area were seated and 2 at the bar. Our waitress was friendly enough, and knowledgeable about the menu, so that helps when it's your first time somewhere. My husband ordered the fettuccine and meatball and I ordered the Chicken Piccata (it's what I almost always order when it's on a menu, I can't help it...I see that and it's tunnel vision from there). I also ordered a glass of the house Pinot Grigio since the entrees didn't come with a salad or soup, so I figured I could enjoy that while we waited.Well, after 10-15 mins, our waitress came back to fill our water glasses and I told her to forget the wine and she said ""oh you don't want it anymore?"" and I just stated ""I didn't realize it would take this long to pour a glass of wine..."" Again...they weren't busy. I don't know if she forgot or what but either way, I didn't want to have to crush it while eating my meal. She did bring us olive oil and bread. Three slices of bread. Nothing special about either of those and the three slices for two people was an interesting touch. Our meals came out shortly after I told her I didn't want the wine. It all LOOKED good. The bone in my chicken was an unusual surprise. It also wasn't cooked like I was used to seeing, not saying it was a bad thing, because it wasn't dried out, but it also didn't have much flavor. It wasn't breaded or pan fried, which is what I was expecting. Husband ordered the popular fettuccine and meatball and was a little surprised when it was super soft inside and red (looked and tasted not cooked). Our waitress did have a good explanation for that - apparently the meat is braised for a day before hand and it's a blend of pork and veal. He felt okay eating it after that, but when you're not expecting that, it'll put a halt in your eating. For the price, I feel like we should've just gone to Olive Garden and we would've both enjoyed our meals much more. So that combined with slow service and not super good tasting food, we won't be back.",Ashley E.,,,,,,

Our order was taken, and the food was brought out in a timely manner.The food here is excellent. It's always so tasty and perfectly seasoned.  The meatball is always worth getting.I got the Fettuccine & Meatball Torn Bread Crumb, Alfredo, Tomato Marinara.  If you get just 1 meal here, I highly recommend this meal. It's so good. We also did a lunch another time, so I'll add comments about our lunch visit as well.We had the Crispy Potato Pizza (Pancetta, Parmesan Onions, Taleggio Cheese, Arugula) and the Marcella's Bistecca Burger (Rosemary Focaccia, Parmesan Onion, Roasted Tomato, Lettuce).The crispy potato pizza is so delicious: we get this frequently.

A read a review about being a glorified Olive Garden and I think is about right. The Italian is BASIC... not much taste, oily and disappointing.

We were coming in town from California and wanted to get all of our families together to celebrate the holidays and for some to meet for the first time. Our party size changed quite a few times but the staff at Marcella's still went above and beyond to accommodate us. We had two servers (I wish I could remember their names!) that were more than gracious to help us rearrange the tables to get all 17 of us around the same table. They provided the best service I have ever had especially for a large, needy, hungry party of 17! The food was outstanding and the manager came in to check on us as well. We were finished with dinner and my now- fiancÌ©, pulled out my beautiful ring and popped the question! The staff nor anyone in the room knew he would propose then. However, they girls were very polite and shut the curtain to let us socialize afterwards. It was the perfect evening and I can't thank everyone at the Polaris Marcella's enough!

The service was pretty prompt too. We were a group of 5 and I don't think anyone of us had any complaints. The food was great...Garlic Bruschetta's...were scrumptious.. literally melted in my mouth..savored every bite. We also tried Calamari and loved it. Everything we ordered was so good.

I'm a fan of their kids menu options, and LOVE their red wine sangria.I'm pretty sure Marcella's has the best meatball ever. I usually stick with the fettuccine alfredo with meatball. It's seriously delicious. We also like to come for a happy hour with friends. Please note that HH is only in the bar area and they fill up quickly, so if you want to snag a table get here as early as you can. The pizzas are good and I've also enjoyed my tastes of the picatta and the braised beef cannelloni.The only thing keeping this place from being a 5 star review is the bread they serve is just not great (it's cold, and usually dry - I expect more from a CM restaurant) and I think the price point can be a bit too high for some of the menu items - maybe I'm just cheap, but $17 for a plate of spaghetti that doesn't come with a salad or anything else seems a bit high to me?",Malini S.,,,,,,

I saw the servers bringing out a number of different salads and dishes from the kitchen for others, but the Ravioli Mezzaluna caught my eye.   For $13.79, the lunch entree is ravioli with goat cheese, cabbage, italian bacon and mushroom with a light mushroom sauce.  They bring a serving of the house bread to the table as well.

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,3,2012/1/17,Waiter was not very informed on wine which in itself isn't unforgivable but the acoustics in the dining room was eardrum ahattering.

A family style restaurant with huge portions and lots of options for people seeking a hearty meal. However there are also lighter meals as well! Wednesday you can get bottles of wine at half off, and yes, wine is served with tumbler glasses because it is actually the traditional way in Italy to serve wine. They are always having great chef features throughout the week and weekend. Give it a try, it's well worth it!",Brooke W.,,,,,,

The Panini was good.  The spinach and roasted tomato in the Panini were fresh.  The fries were just fries.  Overall the food was okay.  Nothing spectacular. The dining room has wood floors.

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,2/26/16,"Hello Happy Hour! 4-630 pm in the bar area; it's not that big might I add. Come prepared to wait or come early.  $18 sangria carafes, red and white. $5 cocktails and 1/2 off appetizers and pizzas. Every working professional was here cramped in a small area going to town on delious bites and drinks.  I wished the restaurant allowed happy hour in the main dining room. I ordered the Primitivo red sangria that was cabernet sauvignon, brandy, soda, strawberries and some other awesomeness that I can't remember.  Ha. That good, I promise.  My girlfriend and I ordered the Calamari. Very, very salty so be prepared.  Good size portion for the price.  Mixed in with the calamari was thinly sliced zucchini and slivers of fried garlic.

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,9/22/16,"We just held my sister's baby shower here in the party room that they have and I can't wait to come back to try more of their menu. The manager Nick was extremely professional and easy to work with. The space says it fits 30 people and we had around 28 and it was a tight squeeze. The room itself is really cute and nicely organized and decorated. For the shower, we had about eight different kinds of pizzas and I think they were a hit. The shrimp pesto pizza and the potato pizza were some of my favorites. The server also did a great job on our party. Again, I can't wait to go back on my next trip to Ohio and try some of the appetizers and entrees that they have on their menu.",Brittany B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,3,5/23/17,"Went here for Mother's Day. We made a 7:30pm reservation and we were seated promptly. Our server was nice but seemed flustered. After talking with him a bit, he let us know that he had been there since early that morning. I can understand now why he seemed a bit off his game. Overall though, the service wasn't bad. He was a nice kid. We started with the Meatball app and it was very good. I like my meatballs more seared...the ones here are very soft. But it was still tasty. For my entrÌ©e I ordered the Braised Beef Cannelloni. Not a good choice. This dish was RICH. It was smothered in sauce and cheese. Now I'm not one to complain about cheese...I love cheese. But this was just way too much. The cannelloni's were filled with beef. There was hardly any ricotta in them. This dish was just way too rich. I had a few bites and that was all I could handle. I think I just made the wrong decision ordering this dish. My bfriend had the carbonara and I sampled it. That was really good! Overall, not a terrible experience, but I know better next time to change my order.",Sue D.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,7/15/16,"I come to Marcella's a lot and I have to say, I think the one at Polaris is a lot better than the one in Short North for these reasons: the restaurant itself is bigger so less wait time (even on a Saturday night), lots of parking available, and it's not as loud (I can barely hear people at the one in Short North). I learned tonight that this Marcella's has happy hour in the bar/lounge area from 4-6:30pm! You can get pizzas, small plates, and some other food items half off and there's also deals on drinks. My fiancÌ© and I split a pepperoni pizza, calamari appetizer, and house salad for less than $25, which is great for a restaurant like this that can rack up a large bill. We were pleased :)I'm only giving 4 stars since Marcella's can be a bit pricey. That's what happy hour is for I guess!",Julie L.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,1/18/16,"I finally ate at Marcella's last weekend, and overall I would say the food was definitely a step above an Olive Garden/mega chain restaurant but not quite the super authentic Italian experience I was going for. We started with the arancini (fried risotto balls) - amazing! So cheesy on the inside and nice and firm so they held up well for dipping into the marinara sauce that comes with it. For our meals, I ordered the chicken parmesan -- pretty tasty, but missing some Italian zest. The only real flavor was cheese, so I guess I was just wanting more herbs and spices in the dish. My husband ordered the meatball with alfredo pasta, and though he loved the pasta he definitely did not care for the jello-like meatball. We've had some moist Italian meatballs before, but this giant meatball was just TOO moist for us! In my mouth it just didn't resemble meat because of the super-soft texture, which is what my husband didn't care for either. The meatball also didn't have any flavor besides the sauce on the outside, so again missing some ""zest"". Overall, I was satisfied with most of our food and would love to go back and try totally different things -- the entire menu sounded great to me!",Jessica L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,5/24/17,Dined in on a weekday afternoon. Absolutely no wait and waiter was quick to greet us. He advised us that they'd essentially cook anything to order.

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,11/30/15,"Update November 2015Not sure why this gets less stars than downtown - the food is excellent and the service really good. Last time there I got my usual (Fettuccine Alfredo with the Giant Meatball) and the manager came up after. We spoke and I expressed my love for this meal. To my surprise the manager comes out with all three components and the recipe! Now I can try to make this at home - I cannot expect to equal it but to share your recipe with a patron is really out of the norm. Always well prepared food. Always good service. Always a fast meal (it doesn't take 2 hours to eat because service is so slow). I continue to come here and consider it my favorite restaurant in Columbus, Ohio.From July 2015Listen to my story. I love their Fettuccine and Meatball; it is one of my favorite meals EVER. I wad headed back to Chicago and wanted this meal before I left. We arrived at 11:30 AM on Sunday to find they opened at noon. We felt we could wait of our meal was ready at noon. I called ahead and asked if we could order now for Dining in. They say it would be ready shortly after we arrived. When we arrived at the restaurant a few minutes early we were quickly seated and our meal brought to us. The quality was impeccable and the service attentive and swift. I got my meal and was out the door in less than 20 minutes and I am HAPPY. Love this place!",Michael W.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,10/24/15,"3.5 stars. Marcella's is a nice place. Our service was very good.We started with an order of Arancini (Fried Risotto, Mozzarella and Marinara). I've only had Arancini one other time and it wasn't very good. This Arancini was really good. Danielle ordered the ""Make Your Own Pasta"" - penne w/ tomato cream sauce and a meatball (because i wanted to try the meatball). she's not always a fan of tomato sauce which is why she got the tomato cream sauce. she liked the sauce and even said that she may not have needed the cream. She didn't think i was going to like the meatball because it was so tender but i loved it. The reason she got the meatball was because the meatballs are a half pound each and they charge $9 for a meatball as an appetizer but only $4 to add it to the pasta creation dinner. Needless to say, i did love the meatball. It was very tender but it was also delicious.For my dinner I just got the ol' standby - Penne Alla Vodka. It was good but I've had better. I did like the sliced mushrooms in the sauce. They were great.If we lived in the area we'd very likely go back.",Rick W.,,,,,,

It was the right amount of food for four people and we were pleasantly full.  I loved everything and am looking forward to trying more pizzas and cannot wait to order the arancini and stuffed mushrooms again.  The zucchini app was more like zuchini chips sliced quite thin and a little oily for my taste but loved everything else.  We spent about 12$ each total, quite a steal!",Sharmeela S.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,10/19/15,"Marcella's is a Columbus classic, and while I don't love the menu at the Polaris location as much as I do for the one in the Short North. That being said, both locations have an AWESOME happy hour, possibly my favorite in Columbus. Most of their beer/wine/cocktails are $5 and under, and a ton of food options are half off as well. No $5 bar food pretzel sticks and/or gross cheesy chips here! All of their pizzas are amazing, and they are only $5-$8 at happy hour and it is a decent amount of food. Outside of happy hour, the food is still fairly priced at about $15 per entree. They have a variety of Italian entrees including pastas, risotto, chicken and seafood dishes. I have enjoyed every dish I've tried, but my personal favorite is any of their risottos (they often have a dinner special with risotto). It is authentic, filling, and delicious!I'm not giving 5 stars just because this place, like all restaurants at Polaris, gets crazy busy and there is often a wait for a table and a pretty significant wait for food. This is fine if you're on a date/having a work meeting over dinner, but if you're looking for a quick bite to eat, this is not your place.",Gina M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,2008/2/15,"Arrived yesterday afternoon at 1:00 p.m. and were seated immediately.  It was a beautiful day, so we decided on dining on the front outside patio facing Polaris Parkway.  Fresh bread was brought to the table within five minutes, with extra virgin olive oil poured on an accompanying plate.  The bread was very good, but we recently had this same free appetizer at Romano's Macaroni Grill and in their version they grate fresh black pepper in the olive oil - this makes all the difference in the world.  My wife orders the 1/2 a mushroom pizza and a chopped salad, and I opt for the four cheese pizza.  My wife's food comes out, and we were immediately impressed by the presentation.  The chopped salad was very good, but my wife missed the note about the salad having Gorgonzola cheese which she hates (her mistake).  Her pizza is absolutely amazing with her commenting that this pizza had the best mushrooms she had ever eaten on a pizza.  My pizza was equally as good.  The sauce and crust were obviously homemade, and were near perfection.  The homemade mozzarella cheese slices were very creamy and just pushed this pizza over the edge.  Read my other reviews - I am a pizza fanatic (lunatic) and this was one of the best pizzas I've had - period.  Very impressed.  Our waitress, a young lady with dark hair (name withheld), was not very good.  I've had much worse waitresses, but she really didn't seem to care much about taking care of us, or answering questions.  I got the impression that I was bothering her with my questions (I had never been to Marcella's before - give me a break).  She also managed to charge my wife for two meals, an then blamed it on a computer glitch.  The other young lady who was working the patio really had her act together, and hopefully next visit we will be lucky enough to have her as our server.  Can't wait to visit again.  We are already craving that pizza.",Jon A.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,5/26/15,"Marcella's is a very solid choice for italian in Columbus. You might be able to find better, but the combination of quality for the price point is definitely in favor of the patron.We started with the veal meatball appetizer which... is one massive meatball. Covered in sauce, and falling apart. Yum. I always say the most basic things an Italian restaurant should deliver is 1) from-scratch pasta (it's not that hard, and if it's 60% of your menu, do it); and even more importantly, 2) a home run red sauce. Marcella's does #2 very well, I was dipping bread, whatever I could find in that sauce. #1 I'm not convinced it's homemade... but it was not obvious that it wasn't. I had the gnocchi and the generous shreds of lamb in the sauce made it a satisfying meal like only meat can do. The gnocchi themselves had a good taste and texture, I honestly wasn't sure if they were homemade or not. If not, they have a good supplier as they weren't tough and chewy.",Jason M.,,,,,,

The lamb bologenese on top of the gnocchi had the perfect amount of meat, sauce, spices. We also tried the Fettuccine Alfredo with meatball. The meatball itself is like 3/4th a pound!Drinks - Like all Cameron Mitchell Restaurants, they only allow happy hour in the bar area. The bar area is way too small for how busy it gets. The bar stools are first come, first serve, but if you want a table you need to put your name in the waitlist at the front desk. On a Thursday just before 5, the waittime was at 45 minutes.. Once you actually get a table the happy hour is pretty good. They make the drinks strong. The noise level in the bar area is SO LOUD though. We were yelling to hear each other.I'm giving 5 stars for the food. The food was really good. Probably one of the best italian restaurants I've been too. The hassle & noise in the bar area are not considered in my rating. If they were, I'd give this place a 3.",Angie K.,,,,,,

We had a caprese salad which was bland, and i got the chicken piccata which was not true chicken piccata. It had bone in and it was not a true piccata sauce. My fiancee had the linguine clam sauce, and it was flavorless and had very few clams in it. The best part was the pecorino fondue appetizer and his sweet tea. I sent the piccata back...which i never do, and they were very gracious to replace it with the shrimp pesto pizza, which was much better.

Today, while the food was largely what we expected, the service wasn't.  We brought our daughter for her Birthday dinner and although the dining room was only half full and our waitress only seemed to have 3 small tables (ourselves included) we consistently were neglected.  After seating our beverages took 15 minutes to come out followed by 20 for appetizers.  To round out that experience, our Bruschetta was cold - probably too long sitting on the counter before our waitress picked it up.  Finally, our entrees showed up again without the waitress being anywhere around (so no Parmesan cheese shavings this time around).

The flavor was there, the texture of the risotto was spot on, the creaminess I expect was present and not overwhelming, the downside was in its proteins.  They were overcooked.  Everything that had it going in this dish was ruined by the overcooked pieces.  They were generous with their proteins but poorly prepared.We ordered a variety of appetizers. Cheese plates, olives, meats, everything we ordered stimulated our appetite as they should.

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,2009/11/15,"Dad was wanting Italian and we were hoping for something less franchised than OG or Carrabba's for his last night in Ohio; this place fit the bill. Table behind us was a large group of Italians (promising sign). Food was excellent--marinara had a good basil aroma, arrabiata sauce had other flavors beyond just chili flakes, the bread was dense and chewy, and the dessert menu had offerings other than Italianized versions of stuff you can find at Kroger's bakery. We had the almond chocolate cake and the cannolis. The cake had that chocolate liqueur taste to it that I love, and the cannolis were both delicate and rich, and came in threes with a side of berries.Drew and another waitress doted on us the entire time, and even comped some items for making us ""wait"" before coming to take our drink orders (honestly we weren't even aware we were waiting abnormally long) so it was a very happy surprise when we got our bill. I'll be bringing my family here when they come visit again, and hopefully we'll be leaving Marcella's with the same delicious garlic breath and a big bag of leftovers next time.",Lauren C.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,2,3/17/17,Went to dinner on 3/15/17. I ordered the lasagna. It tasted like I made it when using a jar sauce. And that's not saying much. The portions were large. My husband and daughter were also disappointed after tasting their parmesan chicken. Again the portion was large but it tasted like that at Olive Garden. There's no reason to ever visit this restaurant again and I can't understand why it was so crowded on a Weds. night. However the service was (a little too) fast and the prosciutto bruschetta appetizer tasted fresh.,Aimee M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,2010/11/15,"My favorite restaurant in Columbus for Italian. My favorite entree is the linguine with clams...it's just slightly spicy, super garlicky and always cooked perfectly. I'd eat it every day if I could.Service is always pretty good, servers are friendly but not annoying, and I've never once had an issue with the food.",Brooke R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,3,2006/2/15,"Came here on a Tuesday night with the coworkers and we ordered a storm of food. We got the mushroom, bruschetta, and other stuff which turned out mediocre. I got the gnocchi, which I am obsessed with, but it wasn't that good. We asked about the pasta and they told us some of their pasta is not made in house which was a red flag. Drinks were gone and desserts were also fine. I'd say this is a mediocre place, nothing surprising. Maybe the pizza would have been better, maybe I'll order it next time if I ever come back.",Will Y.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,5/30/16,"My family visited from Maryland for the holiday weekend and we decided to give Marcella's a shot. It was a brilliant decision, as all of the food was fantastic and freshly prepared. I ordered the Braised Beef Cannelloni and it was flawless in fresh, rustic Italian style. My brother ordered Chicken Parm and loved it, Mom ordered a fantastic dish of pasta and a large meatball, while Dad had a fantastic veal dish. The fried risotto balls dipped in the house made marinara made for an excellent precursor to the meal and the cheese tray was well-prepared and executed. I will be back.",Chris D.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,1,4/17/15,"Don't go here if you're by yourself in town for business.  Recommended to me by a client especially the meatballs.  Went in to sit at bar told or was for happy hour but they could seat me right away in the restaurant.  Sat down read the menu and waited. And waited.  Tables on other side of me both seated served drinks. I still waited.  Four wait staff walked past.  Finally went to the hostess who seated me. ""Where are you sitting?

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,5/28/15,"My husband and I were part of a table of 10, and everyone loved the food. I would have liked to lick the plate of my eggplant parm with fettuccini and marinara sauce (I poured some of the delicious bread dipping olive oil on the fettuccini, which made it even better). My husband's potato gnochi was incredible. The couple across from us ordered the chicken marsala, and they were also members of the clean plate club. Our server was excellent, as you would expect at a Cameron Mitchell restaurant. And a bottle of wine was half price, their regular Wednesday special. we'll be back!",Arlene A.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,2004/12/14,"We had a very enjoyable visit to Marcella's at Polaris. I visited with a group of four with a reservation, and we were seated promptly by a friendly hosting staff. Our server was prompt and attentive, and the atmosphere was similar to the tone set by the first location in Short North, a comfortable homey experience with mismatched dishes. The food was quite good. I was happy to see this location also offers gluten-free bread brought out with the regular, and it was a delightful herb bread that was very flavorful. The server was kind enough to bring out two baskets, so that the non-gluten free folks in our group could sample it too. Everyone was quite impressed with taste and texture.Dinner really hit the spot! Dishes ordered included the classic Spaghetti & Meatball, the Eggplant Parmesan, and the Gnocchi con Bolognese. As others have mentioned, the meatball in the spaghetti is more than enough - it's about the size of a hamburger patty! The Eggplant Parmesan came out warm and cheesy, and the gnocchi paired with the sauce was much enjoyed.The gluten free menu features a number of options, including gluten free dough and pasta to make a variety of pizza and pasta dishes. I opted for the Roasted Chicken & Broccolini Risotto, which was creamy and delicious with caramelized onions, chicken, and chopped broccolini. All of the dishes were good-sized, and we took a number of leftovers home with us.Those in the group who can eat gluten shared an order of Cannoli for dessert. They said it was quite good, with some great flavors from candied orange and pistachio, and it came with a side of chocolate ganache. There were three large cannoli on the plate, so it was a nice serving size for sharing after dinner.Great meal!",Marissa C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,6/20/16,"If I was just basing my review on the food, I would give them 5 stars. Everything tasted great, and the portion sizes were perfect! The service was average. The hostess was polite, and our waiter seemed very nice. He was attentive without being annoying. Unfortunately, we had to wait a while between being seated and when our waiter first appeared. The prices were about what we expected, between $10-$20 per meal. We would definitely go again!",Candace T.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,3,2/17/15,"We went here for my husband's birthday and i was totally underwhelmed.  I had been to the Short North location a few times and besides (according to our waiter) having a different menu, the vibe is completely different.  The decor here is totally Olive Garden in the 90s, and the food was only marginally better.We had calamari and bruschetta to start, then my husband has seafood risotto and I had the lamb ragu and gnocchi.  The desserts were DEFINITELY the highlights--I had the panna cotta and my husband had the cannoli.  I just felt like the service was okay, the food didn't taste super homemade or fresh, and although my husband liked it (good, because it was his birthday!) I wasn't super impressed and if I was going to go again, I'd go to the short north or I'd try a different Cameron Mitchell restaurant.I think the biggest thing was that I've come to expect great food and service from Cameron Mitchell as well as an on-trend restaurant, and I felt like this location was none of those things.",Morgan M.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,4/17/15,"This review is for happy hour -- my only experience. Nice atmosphere (lively, but not too loud), attentive service, good happy hour prices, but the calamari app had too much fried squash and not enough calamari. The breading was also kind of heavy. Would not recommend that.  Their wine by the glass pours are very fair.",Matt K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,2,8/21/13,"I've been to the Short North location and they feel like completely different restaurants. Went during their happy hour; best thing was the 3.75 glass of wine.Food tasted like mediocre frozen foods. Not sure if I made some bad selections, but meh overall.Stuffed mushrooms-sausage was so overpowering you couldn't even taste the mushroom. My mom makes a stuffed mushroom that kills theirs.Chopped salad-not very chopped. Seemed like premix salad that comes out of a bag and not very fresh. Not worth 6.79!I tried friends pizza which was ok, but not anything amazing.Best thing was the Melted pecorino. Not sure why mediocre-bad is acceptable in the suburbs.",Erin D.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,8/30/13,"I had a gift card for any Cameron Mitchell restaurant and I chose Marcella's. I was so happy I made this decision. It was the best experience I've had in a restaurant all because of the service. Our waiter was very friendly and recommended the best items on the menu. He did not disappoint us because his picks were delicious! I only wish I could get the recipe for how they made that Chicken Marsala I had tonight. I would make it more often at home the same way.I will definitely be back in this restaurant soon! Their service was exceptional and so was the meal.:)",Tammy A.,,,,,,

My sister has celiacs disease and trying to find a restaurant with a gluten free menu is ridiculously challenging. Most places tell her to order a salad and take off the croutons and dressing. This place had a gluten free menu just as extensive as the regular menu. The gluten free bread was even better than the normal bread! The waitress was nice enough to bring my sister extra and even gave her the recipe! Both of our meals were delicious. My sister and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town. I highly recommend Marcellas for the food, the service and the experience.",Kelly L.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,2,12/30/15,"We brought our 3 grandchildren here prior to toy shopping for Christmas. I eat here OFTEN as I work nearby. I usually sit on the patio and have lunch or in the bar area for happy hour. We have also brought the entire family here for a nice $400 dinner. I have never experienced poor service or attitude here before today. I'm not sure what is happening to this establishment but I hope they reverse it quickly or we will no longer eat here.I had made reservations. Even though it was a Monday night, it was around the holidays so I wanted to be safe instead of sorry. 5 of us were SQUEEZED into a 4 top right beside the kitchen. Not the best way to begin. The waiter, while nice clearly wanted to hurry and flip his tables as he continued to try to rush us. I don't like to be rushed when I eat. I ordered a drink and the kids got milk and my husband ordered a drink. We then ordered 3 appetizers. The waiter wanted our food order right then. Okay honey, this is NOT my first rodeo. I want to enjoy my appetizers at my speed. I don't want to get half way through them only to have my dinner brought to me and not be able to enjoy everything.We told him that we would like to wait until after our appetizers. The appetizers came out and as soon as they hit the table he again wanted to take our food order. I again asked him to let us have our appetizers and then we could better decide what we wanted.The kids devoured the calamari and I fought them for the last arancini!  The mushrooms were like slime and not hot at all. Fail on that one! Because we were at a 4 top, I had no appetizer plate. Our waiter was no where to be found. As one of the servers walked passed me to go to the kitchen I asked her if I could please get a plate. She said SURE. It took her forever and when she returned she brought me a saucer (like cup and saucer) I asked her for a plate. She rudely replied ""you can't use this""? I said ""Well, I would prefer a plate"" She GRABBED the plate from my hand and said in a snotty little voice..""FINE, I will get you a PLATE"" WOW.When I told our server what had happened he laughed, yes laughed and said, Sorry bout that.I NEVER saw a manager on the floor the entire time we were there so I couldn't even tell management about this very RUDE server. Every time she walked passed me she gave me a very dirty look. Really? High School much?Our dinners were fine, nothing spectacular. The kids got spaghetti, hubby got steak, I had a salad and a meatball. LOVE the meatballs!!!The food is usually much better I'm not sure what was going on this particular evening but whatever it was, it wasn't good!",Janie I.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,2,2009/8/16,"I have been here a handful of times over the last couple years.  Don't go later in the evening, as your food won't be cooked and your wait staff won't care if you are there.  Great for a big party.  They treat you very well for that. Definitely one of those places where the food and service is better during their ""peak"" hours.  I have been there both during their busy time and twice at 8 pm.  Both times at 8 PM, my food was undercooked.  I usually love eggplant parmesan, but I am certain they have no idea how to prepare it.  Will never order again.  My friend ordered a pasta with chicken in it and literally had 2 bites of chicken in it. Not 2 pieces, 2 bites. Really, no need to go again.  Too many restaurants to try and I've given this one more than enough chances.",Lisa H.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,2,11/21/12,"I'll just come out and say it: I'm not a fan of Marcella's. It feels like an Olive Garden with slightly better decor. And I kinda like Olive Garden, actually, but it has more to do with the kitch and depravity of it. Such thrills don't suit Marcella's.We came in for happy hour on a Friday before a movie. Even though we arrived right at 5 pm, the tables in the bar were already full. We didn't mind a short wait. Part of the problem, however were the other patrons in the bar adding to their parties (though it was bar seating, you still had to see the hostess), so they had enough tables but not enough chairs because everyone was dragging in chairs and increasing their groups. I don't really know what Marcella's could have done about this, besides eventually bring in more chairs (which they eventually did), but really, the other patrons were super annoying.The place was packed with suburbanite middle aged women all dressed in some variation of the same outfit. ""OH MY GOD, MAMA NEEDS HER WINE!! Hehehehehehe!"" I bet they were talking about how many shoes they bought at DSW, all the great no-bake recipes they are going to make out of Cool Whip and Velveeta for Thanksgiving, and how great it is to have a ""GIRL'S NIGHT!!"" Gawd.(Nothing against DSW, Cool Whip, or Velveeta. I've had my share of moments with each, but I'm painting a picture here.)So, we're packed in like sardines at a hightop at this point. It's so loud with all the middle-aged squealing over ... I dunno, Grey's Anatomy or something... that we could hardly converse. The wine was okay. There's no benefit to getting a half-bottle over by-the-glass, nor a bottle over a half-bottle. I thought the half-bottle would come in a split, but it came in a carafe. I guess that's fine, I just ... I don't know. It seemed a little overpriced, but at least it was happy hour. My dining mate and I split a chopped salad and a couple of small plates. The chopped salad was like something from a salad bar. Iceburg lettuce and yawner toppings. The stuffed mushrooms, however, were quite good. Definitely the best part of the entire experience. The fried zucchini was paper thin and whispy fried particles of squash. As much flavor as fried tissue paper. Our waitress was attentive at first, but then we lost her for quite awhile. We were going to order another round of drinks, but never got around to it. By the time we finally saw her again, we needed to pay the bill and get to the theater.Maybe I'm being too hard on Marcella's... I just don't understand the hype. The food isn't really good enough to wait and brave the throng of wine-injected Stepford wannabes. Columbus has so many other fun options!",Catherine J.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,2,2002/11/16,"Usually a great meal, but last Saturday was a dismal event. The host staff was rude.

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,3,2007/7/14,"Oy vey... I dread being dragged out to birthday dinners because more than likely they are held at these kinds of places. I will tell if right of the bat that the service was average taking account of our large party, nine diners. Err.. Waitress took our orders promptly, refill time on water was acceptable, and the refill on bread was iffay (cmon, we are a party of nine - no shayt we are going to go through a mere two plates of bread easily). Yeah, service portion of the experience was acceptable, but the food being caveat. I got the salmon; wow, was it a small portion of salmon for what it was worth. There exists in the culinary world several things called spices to enhance a dish.. Chefs of Marcellas, y'all should know better than to send out a overly bland dish...Le sigh.",Scott B.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,2,9/22/12,"I definitely expected more from a Cameron Mitchell restaurant. I was expecting great tasting food, good service and an overall good experience. Some friends and I went here for a birthday dinner and were all very disappointed. My friend got the special which was ravioli that was $23! The portion was extremely small - to the point where he was thinking about ordering another small entree. My spaghetti was average. I got a meatball as well which was pretty good. The meatball had good flavor but I found the marinara sauce to be really bland. My sister got the eggplant parmesan. She said it was soggy and mushy. She actually said she had better eggplant parmesan at Olive Garden. Overall, I was disappointed. I would probably not go here again just based on the overpriced food for the mediocre quality.",Colleen R.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,2,5/20/15,"I came here on a Tuesday night with some family members for dinner.  We had reservations at 6:30 PM and were seated right away.  We ordered our drinks and then the waiting began.  It took 20 minutes to get cocktails.  Then we weren't able to order for a long time after this as our server kept disappearing.  We finally flagged her down and told her that we were ready to order and it took another 15 minutes for her to come back and take our order.  We received our food sometime after 8 PM (for a 6:30 dinner reservation and PS I know the time because one of our diners had to leave to pick up a child from practice and ended up leaving before the meal was over).  My meal promptly had to be sent back because it contained an allergen which I specifically ordered it without.  The restaurant was kind enough to take it off my bill without my even requesting that, but it wasn't enough to make up for the poor service.  Also, the food wasn't great.  I ordered the margherita pizza without cheese.  My pizza was clearly canned tomatoes dumped onto flat-bread with a few pieces of basil.  Overall I have truly come to expect more from a Cameron Mitchell restaurant.  Because of food allergies, my family tends to dine almost exclusively at his restaurants because we normally have a great experience and are guaranteed a good and safe meal.  Not this time.  I have no plans to come back to this restaurant anytime soon.  The entire experience was pretty lackluster.  I'd stick with another CM restaurant.  Like any other one.",Kate Q.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,3,10/21/14,"This place came highly recommended from some friends of mine, who were Italian, and you know how seriously Italians take Italian food! Before dinner we grabbed some drinks at the bar and the bartender was very nice- even making me an Italian soda that wasn't on the menu (I sadly wasn't partaking in wine because I was running a marathon the next day.) Service was attentive, even for our party of 6 and the layout of the restaurant was nice. As for the food, my father ordered Linguine and Clams, which the next day he told us made him ill overnight, so that was disappointing.  I had the Penne with the vodka cream sauce and added chicken and thought it was just alright. For some reason the dish had a slight freezer burn taste to it, but I couldn't pinpoint which ingredient would make it taste that way. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals. The portions were definitely plentiful and I heard the Caesar salad was very nice. Overall, a good experience, but not the same caliber as the other Cameron Mitchell restaurants around town.",Allison B.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,2,2002/8/12,"Marcellas @ Polaris.  It's Olive Garden grade Italian food served at higher end prices.  Is that a fair criticism?  Well, yeah, it is I think as 'value' in today's world is what matters.Like, I had a 'good' experience here: the food was good, service was fair.  But was it worth the $100 price tag for three people?  Not really.   We didn't get any free salad (like you do at Olive Garden).  The olive oil for bread dipping is just like plain oil: no added ingredients like balsamic vinegar, pepper/garlic/parmesan cheese.  Plain white bread.  Kinda boring stuff.   The pasta and pizza was 'good' but not great.The decor and ambience is nice: dark, moody.  I did like the atmosphere.Our waitress was 'fair' - she did an okay job, nothing spectacular.  So is it worth the hype?  Not really.  I get really frustrated when I can whip up better food at home than going out and spending hundreds on average food at a restaurant.  Like who is running these places?

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,10/14/13,"""It Doesn't Have To Be An Occasion To Be An Occasion""She's my best friend, my crony, my consort, my girlfriend of just over two years, and her birthday falls smack dab in the middle of our busy schedules. She worked on her birthday, that weekend, the next, and on and on (two jobs), until my birthday rolls around the next month. I find out a week in advance that this angel takes that Friday following my birthday off for me. I scramble to put something special together. We are gonna spend the evening together - go out to eat - and when I think of ""someplace nice,"" Cameron Mitchell restaurants immediately comes to mind.Prologue: I remember years ago when the racks of snicker doodles I was pushing around a warehouse ceased to emerge from the kitchen, and I asked a co-worker ""what is the best restaurant you've been to in Columbus?"" Without hesitation she said, ""probably Cap City."" At home that night I googled the Fine Diner, and learned about all the area Cameron Mitchell restaurants.  Enter Marcella' s (Polaris) - a place neither of us had been to. When we first walk in I look at her and can tell that she is enamored by the intimate feel of the place. It's well-lit - which to me means dark - essentially we dine by candlelight, something I'm sure neither of us expected. ""This is going to work,"" I say to myself. We received a very warm, welcoming greeting from three smiling young ladies - one of whom found us a table immediately. Our waitress (and whoever prepared the drinks) is prompt; we receive our menu's and before we decide what to get, she's back with our cocktails. I ordered the Milan Manhattan, because I've had Woodford Reserve Bourbon and I like its smooth taste, and further, because it might pair exceptionally well with Di'saronna - it did. But honestly, at first glance of her foamy concoction - the Strawberry Balsamic Martini - I knew I had to try it. It's a delicious pre-entree dessert - not too sweet though - and I liked hers better.  The dinner menu is short, ""vital"" might be a better word... I like the idea of a chef being able to focus his/her talents on a few choice plates, as much as I hate choice anxiety.Even though we are adults, neither of us can decide what to get. So the kid in us comes out and we decide to split a pepperoni pizza. It turns out that just one is more than enough for the two of us. It was well-presented, wasn't too saucy, wasn't under-cooked or burnt, and was made with whole wheat dough, and provolone cheese... our favorite.Before I dig in I tell her I want to wash my hands - and I really do. First I make a B-line for the parking lot, and grab something special... Side Story: This isn't going to be an all-encompassing review, but I will tell you that I liked the design of the restrooms - specifically the powdered soap and the vintage sink.   As I walk back to our table she's staring down the pizza, waiting patiently for me to return, and it makes me smile. Before we start eating, I pull a gift box from underneath the table and hand it to her just as she gives me a look that says, ""well are we gonna eat this pizza!?"" And even in the darkness I see her blush a little. ""We didn't get to do anything for your birthday, so for my birthday I wanted to take you out for yours."" She hadn't even opened the box up and she said, ""I love you."" Technically, it was neither one of our birthday's, so this wasn't any official ""occasion,"" but as I fastened an infinity bracelet to her wrist, the planning that went into Marcella's set a lovely backdrop - the perfect stage.

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,3,3/29/12,"I was really expecting more from Marcellas, being a Cameron Mitchell Restaurant and all but it turned out to be more like Brio or Bravo, at least the bars happy hour.It was packed, but lucky for us we got a tiny table, one chair and bench.Way too cramped for 3 people and after asking several times for a larger table they brought us a buzzer and said we were on the list AFTER our food arrived, no point now...I get that its packed since they do have great prices from 4-7pm but then they should accomidate the rush with better seating and more than one frazzled and very overworked waitress.We took advantage of the great deals and got the cheese bread, better than at most places but not very cheesy, garlicky, too plain for me.Also the arancini, risotto fritters only so so. Nothing bad, basically fried rice balls, again lacking flavor.The Bistecca Burger not bad, but nothing special whatsoever, 2 patties and 3 meat I was expecting more, it was more like a McDonalds double cheeseburger, fries soggy.The chicken parmesan after requesting all items without mayo, had mayo on it so we sent it back after a bite, at least we got to try it and it was just a frozen chicken patty, not real breast meat, dissapointing.My favorite item was the italian beef sandwhich which I got in spicy, which it wasn't but it was pretty tasty, traditonal pulled beef, very very good dipping sauce and nice veggies, fries again soggy.I got a caesar and it was fresh, the parmesan crisp and croutons yummy, the house dressing was horrible, so sour that I had the worst taste in my mouth all evening, bummer.To round it off we got the sicilian pizza, after watching all the delicious looking pizzas come out I wondered if we should have ordered MORE pizza but tasting it I was glad we didn/t.The famous meatballs were mushy and watery, I am so glad my husband said no to ordering the huge meatball app or the meatball sliders.They ruined the pizza, the crust was fine, sauce and cheese non existant.In all $30 for all that food was descent, the food no better than Brio or bravo where you can get the bar menu for $2.95+,, so I'd rather go there.",Nijole T.,,,,,,

The bread was good, the olive oil was fresh with good taste.  I had the lamb gnocchi; that was good in fact very good.  We had the clam linguine; a great dish with good pasta.  Nice clams were in the dishes.  We also tried the carbonara, and the dish was great.  Good balance with the cream and bacon.

Why don't more restaurants use this handy service? Having both worked at and had owned Italian restaurants, this is one category that I am super-critical of. Take the review with a grain of salt, so to speak.The complaints:Paper placemats should only ever be used in BBQ joints. Tacky.Do you really need this much crap on a table? No.The menus have a ""cheap"" feel to them. Very little in the decor suggests that the place serves Italian food.Bread and olive oil? Really? Is it still the 90s?The praise:Food is authentic and excellent. Seriously, I have had just about every item on the menu and have never had anything that I would give a 3 or lower to.

Lucky for us a seat opened up at the bar and we decided to eat there. The bartenders, Audrey and Shawn, were very friendly and kept us laughing all night. They made us some off menu drinks that were amazing! We had the cheese plate and tomato basil soup to start. The cheese plate is always good and I love the spicy apricot preserves they serve with it. We also split the Crispy potato pizza based on Audrey's recommendation. It was not what I expected. The potatoes were more like homemade chips. It was very good! The first time we went we had penne al a vodka and the mezzaluna pasta. Which was also very good. And our server Brittany was a total sweetheart.

The lamb in the bolognese was melt in your mouth tender, and the ravioli mezzaluna was pleasantly different.

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,2005/9/15,"We had an early dinner here during happy hour. We sat out on the patio, which was great. The one thing that I noticed right away was that the happy hour is quite a bit different from Marcella's in the Short North. It was still a good happy hour though, and it goes a half hour later. The drinks were great, the only problem was that both mine and my husbands drinks were empty for about 10-15 minutes before another server brought our food out, and we had to ask him for new drinks. Other than that everything was great though. I still prefer Marcella's downtown, but when you're up in Polaris this is a great option.",Steph L.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,11/30/12,"I have to start with the fact that having a terrific happy hour this close to work is beyond awesome. Half-price cocktails and apps... yes, please.Hard to tell you where to start-- oh, wait... cocktails. While there are many that are featured at the half-price price point, the Milan Manhattan (Woodford Reserve, DiSaronno and Vanilla Simple Syrup) and the Whiskey Rosso (Jameson, Passionfruit PurÌ©e, agave nectar and Chianti Classico) are the highlights.Food-wise... the meatball is an obvious (and delicious) choice. However the pizzas are terrific as well, especially the Pesto Shrimp Pizza, with the Arancini (four-cheese risotto fritters) is a very close third.Try to get here early.

There were 3 of us so we ordered 2 pizzas to split, got the mushroom and the roasted chicken. The roasted chicken, was different but really good (wasn't really expecting a sweet bite when i bit into it first, but it worked very well with the chicken). Dough was very fresh and good. The service was immaculate, and I was told that it was the service that made the place top notch and it was true.All in all a great place, I'll have to stop by again when I'm in Columbus.",Amsul K.,,,,,,

There was still plenty to choose from.I ordered the squid, which came with a ton of vegetables that I didn't want and I had to pick through them to get to the calimari.  I also ordered the beef sandwich which was more than I thought I could finish.  It was HUGE!!  It came with fries and had vegetables on the sandwich.

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,2012/6/12,"I have only been here for happy hour (M-F 4-7pm), and I will continue to only come here for happy hour.

I'm there.I took advantage of $5 cocktails and tried the Milan Manhattan and blood orange bitter soda (w/ tequila). Not a huge fan of Manhattans, so I probably shouldn't have ordered that, but the blood orange bitter soda was phenomenal. And neither drink was short on the alcohol, which can sometimes happen during happy hour specials.I also shared the crispy potato pizza and veggie pizza with a friend (half-price, so $5.50 apiece.) The pizzas aren't terribly big--I'd estimate that one pizza would satisfy one person for dinner. Some other friends ordered the half-off sandwiches ($4.50-5.50 during happy hour), which looked delicious and came with a generous order of fries. Overall, if you choose wisely, you can enjoy some good food at dirt cheap prices during happy hour. Highly suggest.",Christie B.,,,,,,

And then another 10 minutes to order food. And then a bread basket came.The real issue is that there were several parties around us (we were only a party of 2) who were seated, ordered, had eaten, paid, and were gone before our food even got to the table. No one was rude or unfriendly, but I don't understand the inconsistency. I ordered the lasagna, and it was okay until I got to the bottom layer of noodles and I couldn't tell if it was over cooked and chewy or just raw. Some areas of the noodles disentigrated and others tasted like raw dough. Other than the noodle issue, the rest of the lasagna was good. I just had higher hopes.",Chelsey M.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,2010/1/10,"Really well executed menu, but the venue is not my cup of tea. Marcella's menu has been an inspiration to me. It first introduced me to one of my favortie dishes of all time, gnocchi with brown buuter sage sauce. Of course, it figues, that is no longer on their menu. I'm not a fan of the 'small plates' concept. I thinks it is very expensive and silly to be eating meats and cheeses I could get at a deli and cut up and eat at home with no problem. The pizzas are well made and a good size to eat one on your own or share a couple. My fav was the caprese, but I am dying to try to crispy potato. The layout and design of the restaurant as well as the furniture are not comfortable to me at all. I also don't really like all those plates and pizza racks on the tables at all times. I feel like these are really minor gripes since the food is done well, but it does prevent me from really wanting to go there.",Liz M.,,,,,,

They were busy too (Saturday night in Christmas shopping season,) but quickly got us a table.  I didn't know this was a Cameron Mitchell restaurant or I would have searched it out sooner, but the quality was obvious.  Roughly the same price as Olive Garden for much better food.We got beef carpaccio as an appetizer, and it was quite good.  I got the four-cheese tortellini, and it was great.

Total dinner was over 2 hours and they weren't even very crowded. I ordered the lobster and shrimp risotto - the risotto was overcooked and the entire dish only had ONE shrimp.

I could knit-pick on aspects of the service or menu, but I really must admit that my meal was delicious, the service was generally not an issue, the ambiance is nice, and the price really wasn't too bad.  I've always heard that they have one of the best happy hours around.  I do plan on returning for happy hour, at the very least, and would be happy to return for dinner as well. I recommend trying to get a reservation, especially on the weekends.

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,5/24/14,"WOW.  Like almost all of Cameron's restaurants, this place was ace's.  We went the Saturday before Mother's Day -- with parents & sister in tow, to treat them to good Italian; we'd been there earlier in the week and had been really impressed.  I'll note: my family is Italian American, and live in a small town that has no good restaurants. They can get real picky on ""Italian"" food.Anyway...further note: my doctor had me trying gluten-free, due to serious intestinal/digestive issues, to see if it helped...which has been a real trial for this Italian-American, homemade-pizza-and-pasta-loving cook.  I'm NOT a damn food-diet faddie (and I'll stop before I start ranting about that idiocy).  But bluntly, most restaurants ""gluten-free"" options are sadly lacking -- read that as ""damn pathetic"", an attempt to jump on the bandwagon with no thought to what those who really suffer that crap go through.  One of Marcella's competitor's GF ""option"" (and term is used very loosely) looked & tasted like it came out of Chef Boyardee can...and...and...I'm starting to rant again, sorry.With THAT said, Marcella's is different...and awesome.  The waiters on both visits were friendly, knowledgeable, understanding, and very helpful, even to the point of finding out what type of flour was used (so that I can actually make homemade pizza again!!).  And unlike almost all other places offering ""options"" (which are usually one or two of the worst items on the menu & extremely limited), Marcella's actually has a full menu of choices, so I didn't feel limited or left out or relegated to ""salad only"".Service: fast, friendly, attentive, kept our drinks full, answered all questions...and absolutely no condescension over the GF for me (even before I explained about the doctor's limits).  Yeah, that's been a problem at other places, but NOT here!First: the GF Pizza...oh. my. GOD.  Look, most GF pizza crust I've tried tastes HORRIBLE, with an even worse aftertaste.   Marcella's GF pizza was so good, I could not tell it was GF -- on our second visit, my husband even ordered the GF version (he's normal), so we could taste each others', and he couldn't tell it was GF, either.  The GF bread that they brought out tasted better than the regular bread, according to my family who tried both versions (and kudos to the waiters for giving me a separate olive oil plate to avoid contamination from the regular bread...without me having to ask!!).I had the Mushroom/Truffle Oil pizza on my second visit, along with the Pecorino cheese appetizer; my husband had the chicken/Apricot pizza. AWESOME selections.  My sister chose the gnocchi, and declared it the best she'd ever had; likewise my parents with their straightforward spaghetti & Meatball -- and good lord, that meatball was the size of the plate, I swear.  On me & my husband's first visit, I'd had the GF Penne Alla Vodka - again, delicious, and didn't taste GF at all.  The true test of really good Italian cooking?  When the leftovers tastes even better on the re-heat...and yeah, there was enough on both visits that we all ended up taking home leftovers, and it was just as good on the re-heat as it had been at the restaurant.  Now THAT'S an awesome Italian place! My only gripe is that the meatball has no GF option. *sigh*  But hey, with the GF options being this good, it's really a small gripe.   Five stars!",Chris P.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,3,5/14/16,"Wildly inconsistent experiences at this restaurant.  During our first visit on a Saturday night, we were rushed the entire dinner.  We barely started the salads when the entrees were served, and we were whisked out the door in 30 minutes.  I understand if this is the case during a weekday lunch, but not weekend dinner, especially when they knew this was for a birthday dinner.  The next visit we sat in the bar area and had impeccable service.  Tonight, the service was slow and inattentive.  The server did not write down the orders.  The salads were taking forever to arrive, and then the entrees arrived before the salads.  They took the entrees back and the salads arrived, one not as ordered.  The server disappeared for long periods of time.  I began to wonder if she has left to go shopping at Old Navy across the parking lot.  To their credit, I will say the food has been top notch during each visit.  The chicken parmesan was delicious, and the cheese ravioli special from the previous visit was luscious.  Also, they did comp the salads without asking.  It is just frustrating because I want to love this restaurant.  I enjoy the atmosphere and the food.

(thanks Allie)Parmesan Onion appetizer gets 5 stars. Perfect.Three stars because the pepperoni pizza was very bland. And I mean very. We did eat it because we were so hungry but I expected more. If you can't flavor the crust, then the sauce and toppings better deliver.  And after all, it is Cameron Mitchell. I would recommend the pizza for children.We ordered just a meatball off menu and it was the best I have ever had. Very fork tender. Sauce was amazing. We ended up dipping our pizza in it instead to give the pizza more flavor. The bread is rustic, made to be the utensil that you scrape the sauce up with at the end of your meal.Do yourself a favor and order the dessert with gelato and cookies. And make that gelato all pistachio!! So good.The honey vanilla was creamy but again, not a lot of flavor.We would go back but not order the pizza.",Barbara W.,,,,,,

I would eat the Pasta alla Vodka every day for the rest of my life and be completely happy. It was WAY beyond delicious! And the service was excellent, too.

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,3/21/11,"Fantastic happy hour!Came away with a white citrus sangria, the zucchini appetizer, the meatball sliders, a sausage and pepperoni pizza, and two waters for 17 dollars!  We were both completely stuffed and the food was exceptionally good.The sangria came in a carafe that ended up filling my glass three times.  The oranges in the bottom made it taste like a mix between a normal sangria and a mimosa, which was a nice twist from what I was expecting.The zucchini appetizer consisted of ultra-thin slices of zucchini, fried like chips and tossed with Parmesan cheese.  The results were very light and a perfect side to  the meatball sliders.  I can honestly say that those things rival the best meatball sub I've ever had in my life.My husband's pizza was a bit more than one person should eat alone, but that didn't stop him!  I tasted half a piece and the sausage seemed to have a light kick while the sauce tasted pretty much exactly like the sauce on my meatball sliders which was very, very good.If you're going to visit Marcella's it'd definitely be worth the hustle  to get there before 7!",Sabrina L.,,,,,,

While reading over the menu, we decided to start with the arancini (fried cheesy risotto balls).  The risotto was perfectly cooked with lots of cheesy goodness mixed in.  Next came the roasted chicken pizza, topped with gorgonzola, some other unlisted cheese (probably provolone), and parmesan onions.  It was also supposed to have an apricot and chili flake ""jam"" on top but after another misunderstanding with the same server, we had to ask for a side of it so we could put it on ourselves.  We were glad they forgot to put this on, as it was quite spicy- even though we were told it wasn't.  We ordered the double chocolate torte to go, as our server took roughly 15 minutes to deliver our check (only after asking for it 2-3 times for it) and we had a movie to get to.  The slice of torte was surprisgly small, but pretty good...fudgy and not too sweet.  The even smaller scoop (about 4 spoons) of pistacio gelato was very good and paired perfectly with the torte.The food was great, and the prices were even better.  Although the service wasn't the best (and it wasn't even that busy), I will definitely be returning here and would recommend it to others!",Amy S.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,3/13/14,"went out for a birthday and was very pleased with the outcome.server chris was really nice and always made sure our water glasses were filled because we were thirsty walking in. you also knew it was a good place because it was the only part of the parking lot that was full (it was in the 60's the day before and just went back down to the mid 30's yesterday.)but inside was warm and full of people. didn't have to wait long for our table which was nice. bread came out and i was a little sad that they didn't have the seasoning that went with the olive oil. but i understand if it was a hassle to clean up or clogged the drains.i ordered the pesto shrimp pizza and thoroughly enjoyed it, as did everyone else who tried it. everyone else's dishes looked just as good and who can forget the classic spaghetti and meatball? and one is all you need because it is HUGE! we were all pleasantly pleased in the end. plus everything was reasonably priced compared to some of the other restaurants under cameron mitchell.AND they gave a complimentary dessert for the birthday girl. you really don't see that anymore in any restaurant. so we were really happy to be able to try a dessert while celebrating at the same time. cameron mitchell has done it again and has won my vote in coming back. He never disappoints!",Alice C.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,2001/2/12,"We ate here for the first time on NYE. We had an 8:45pm reservation. Weren't seated until 9:30pm and did not get our food until after 10pm. I can't say this is typical for Marcella's as we haven't been before, but it probably is typically for just about every popular restaurant on NYE. While we were waiting for our table, they did bring around some delish cheese ball appetizers, which was a nice way to keep everyone from becoming hunger crabby. Once we finally got our food, I must say it was worth the wait. Sooooo yummy! I got eggplant parm. It was great, except one thing, no noodles. WHAT? NO NOODLES?!?!  My husband got chicken pacata. He said it was okay, but not worth the $17 price tag. As for drinks, my husband got some whiskey concoction that came in a martini glass ans was super sweet. He drank it, but I couldn't have.  I got the Blood orange soda with tequila. Tasted like.....well, orange crush and tequila. Again, a little on the sweet side, but drinkable.  We will be back, on a less popular night.",Emily O.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,2,5/23/11,"I've always had excellent service and food at their Short North location, but this Polaris location was a complete 180. First off we decided to get drinks at the bar before our reservations. The place was only about 50% full for a Saturday night, very surprised. Anyways, there was 4 people at the bar, 3 of them talking to each other about women and dating, the last was busy flirting with a couple. It took 5 minutes before one of them ask if we wanted a drink...of course we wanted a drink if we're at the bar. What a moron.This gets better at dinner, the service was extremely slow and remind you, the place was not busy at all. Our female server was really weird, kept asking us if we're done with our salads when our plates are still full and our forks are still in our hands. Then came our entrÌ©e, it was good as usual, she never asked to get us another drink or refills. She was good at staring down our table about 4 times over the course of 45 minutes and not once making eye contact. Then all of the suddenly, she disappears for a good 15-20 mins. During the whole dinner experience, I only got one refill of my soda and nothing for my beer.I can see why this place isn't that busy and why originally Martini's failed...",R M.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,1/18/14,"All i can say is the value and food is worth five stars. This is my favorite restaurant around central ohio. I have never had a bad meal here and the service is always wonderful. Today I had lunch there and I had a phenomenal waiter who was very nice and filled up my water before it was empty which is for me the mark of a great and attentive waiter. My meal is always wonderful. We started with a cheese platter which was great for the price. Three cheeses, Gorgonzola, pecorino, and aged goat that were decent with apricot preserves (that was the highlight of the plate), grapes, and sliced apples.  And I got the spaghetti with tomato cream sauce which i almost always get because it is so incredible simple and delicious. Everyone else enjoyed their meals as well and I would always recommend this restaurant with fresh unlimited bread, olive oil, and a nice atmosphere.",Ali W.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,3,2004/5/13,Least chainy place to eat in Polaris. So normally the default. don't think it really does justice to Italian. I really just like the bread and oil and wine. I have been told that the one in short north is better.,Angie K.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,2001/3/14,"So much yum.  Was brought here for dinner as part of a job recruitment and I can see why they picked the place.  Great atmosphere and while they were super busy, our waiter was fantastic and very attentive.  The lasagna I had was huge and delicious, and I'm still drooling when thinking about the tiramisu.  We also had multiple appetizers and everything was so good.  I guess this is a chain restaurant but I was very happy with the quality of the food.",Maryam J.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,2,2008/7/11,"We were in the area for a concert and Italian is our favorite so we tried this place based on pretty good ratings online. While nothing was terrible here, everything was just average or a notch below.  While our server was adequate, she had the ""I'd rather be somewhere else"" vibe, made no suggestions or any attempts at interaction beyond the necessary. The gal at Steak and Shake last week was more engaging while serving our $4 hamburger. At 4:30pm there was about 10 people in the place so it wasn't like she was harried.The $18 1/2 bottle of Pinot Noir came with two stacked tumbler glasses (not wine glasses.) Weird. Are wine glasses to difficult to handle? The stuffed mushrooms appetizer was well made but not warm. Sitting around or came out of the fridge and not heated adequately? Speaking of cold, the bread was cold and when I informed the waitress, she said, ""that is how they serve it"" but offered to heat it up. Cold bread is standard??Finally the 'Penne All Vodka' main course was pretty uninteresting. Good quality ingredients but just not beyond average. The description included ""cream"" but the sauce just seemed like olive oil with some pepper.I suppose these are pretty petty complains but when you drop $50 for a meal for two, I look for a meal experience that is better than average. With all the great Italian place around we won't likely be back.",Paul P.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,2002/5/11,The best of the Cameron Mitchell restaurants.  The food is fresh and delicious.  The pizza is a tasty wood fired oven style and a good enough size to feed a hungry guy.,Ben T.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,10/17/13,"Made a reservation here and then was a half-hour late because of a traffic tie-up on 270. They were very accommodating and I really had a nice time at this place. My server was very good, and the carbonara was as good as I've had anywhere. Yeah, they need to get the pizza rack off of the 2-top when you're not having pizza, but otherwise the place was festive and fun and worth a return visit.",David B.,,,,,,
Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,5,2006/3/10,"My husband and I had dinner there last night.  What an incredible meal!  He had the four cheese tortellini with spinach and chicken, and I ordered the crispy potato pizza.  His dish was lush, flavorful, abundant, and came bubbling hot in the serving dish - and I mean bubbling!  Yum!   I ordered the pizza sort of on a whim, as I usually order a more 'main course' dinner, but I couldn't have made a better choice - there was an explosion of flavor on this carefully crafted pizza!  Salty, sweet, bitter, savory, chewy, nutty - holy wah!  It didn't hurt that it was half price bottle of wine Wednesday (I forget the catchy title of this promotion).  And we found out that if we had sat in th bar or on the patio (which, by the way, is NON SMOKING, hooray!), we could have indulged in their half price happy hour specials - which is exactly what we're going to do next week.  The staff was wonderful, from the hostess who seated us to our server to the manager.",KC M.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,4,8/26/12,"I have been to this restaurant many a time.

We were promptly greeted when we walked in, and I was quite surprised they were so packed on a Tuesday night.  Good sign.  We had about a 5 minute wait.  Our waiter was great...I'm mad I forgot his name.  I tried the Penne Alla Vodka with the infamous meatball.  It was delicious!  I am not a huge Italian foodie, but I would definitely order it again.  The only thing was once I got to the center of the meatball, it was kind of raw.  I was almost done, so I didn't bother sending it back, but I would recommending cutting into it before eating, otherwise there might be a trip to the ER in your future.  I also had the little gelato sandwiches for dessert, which were very good as well.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  Definitely a spot worth visiting.",Nicky B.,,,,,,

Marcellas - Polaris,185,3.5,3,2003/12/14,There is a lot of good things to say about this place. To start with our server was very nice and helpful. I was also impressed that she has tried everything on the menu and was able to answer any questions we had about the food. She was also very helpful with wine offering a couple samples before we decided on a bottle to buy for our table. We decided to order the cheese board for an appetizer and it was ok. I actually didn't like the pecorino and blue cheeses but did like the goat cheese. The appy as a whole felt a little disjointed. I should've ordered a more popular choice. I ordered the seafood risotto. It had good flavor but something wasn't quite right with it. There is a certain texture to a risotto that was missing in my dish. My wife had the baked tortellini that was good but nothing to make it stand out and be amazing. Another person at our table had the chicken Parmesan. The portion was huge and it must have been good because the person inhaled it. Over-all the dinner was nice and I will go back just to try something a bit different. I want to add that I think the prices are fair based on what I've seen and that would include the wine as well. The atmosphere is darkly lit but comfortable with the background noise of an Italian cafÌ©. All in all I had a good experience here. A definite cut above the chain restaurants in the area. Not the culinary experience I'm always on the lookout for but a good place for getting together with folks and enjoying a good meal.,Shawn L.,,,,,,

We had reservations & were surprised to be seated immediately even though we were a little early & there seemed to be a lot of people waiting.  Didn't like the seating arrangements though.  We were so close to the other diners I felt as if I could reach over & grab their food.  Also while the drunken, older man next to us was sliding out of his seat he got way too close for comfort.  Like other reviewers have stated the pizza rack is on the table at all times.  Especially at a 2-seater, it should be removed if no one orders pizza.  Service was decent.  We ordered a half-bottle of Chianti which translated into about 4.5 glasses.  Don't expect wine glasses though.  We laughed at ourselves drinking out of tumblers, but it made it interesting.  The BF ordered the salmon with potatoes & olives.  He usually loves olives, but thought they were too salty.  It didn't look like there was much on the plate & he said he definitely could have eaten more.  I ordered the gnocci.  Delicious & the lamb braised sauce was exactly what I wanted.  $57 including tip was pretty good for a V-day dinner, although I'd like it a bit more if the tables were farther apart.",Kara K.,,,,,,

But while we were waiting for him to come back we noticed that one of our glasses had a 2 inch crack from the top down and another had leftover lipstick all around the rim. They also have a table topper that holds pizza or apps and has a stack of plates under it in the middle of the table. Since I was setting in the middle seat (6 seats 5 people) I moved it to the corner spot where no one was setting. There was a line of crumbs and dirt where obviously no one had bothered to move this stuff when they cleaned the table and I had to ask the waiter to wipe it up.Aside from this and having to look for the waiter for refills a few times, everyone was happy with the food and it was reasonably priced, they just really need to work on their cleaning and checking the glasses before they put them on the table.",Lou G.,,,,,,

Excellent service, excellent execution in the kitchen, excellent service.We went for our wedding anniversary and they were awesome. Our server was awesome and most especially with the pacing of the meal. We order an appetizer, shared a salad, a pasta dish and a main dish. All arriving at exactly the right time and with just a few minutes or so in between. Excellent!Also, plates were cleared as we went and as soon as it was clear we were done.Cocktails? Delish. And they can adjust to taste. So if you don't want it do sweet, they worked with that.We were full and skipped dessert.And here is the thing-- I have Celiacs. Eating gluten free isn't so much a choice, but a requirement. We ate exclusively from that menu and we HAD choices. And he did not feel like it was an inferior dining experience and the gluten free bread with the salad course was amazing. This is honestly one of the reasons we decided on Martini.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,2012/3/17,"Visited Martini with a coworker for after-work dinner and drinks and thought it was an ideal place for such an occasion. It seems like it would be a great easy date night option as well. The happy hour menu is generously priced with nearly 20 cocktails for a cool $5. I had the vesper on high with local Watershed gin and vodka - flavors were great and I appreciated that it wasn't watered down (especially for the price).For my meal, I had the pennette alla vodka, and I was a little disappointed in the dish overall. My pasta was well north of al dente, so I didn't get that nice bite and sturdy texture I crave when I'm making the caloric splurge of ordering pasta. The prosciutto added a nice salty burst of flavor, but the vodka sauce was a bit of a miss for me. It was good but not great and just needed a soupÌ¤on of something else - it was decidedly creamy but the vodka wasn't adding much to make it a vodka sauce worth craving, and I just couldn't discern anything other than under-seasoned tomato and cream. The mushrooms were a fantastic addition to the dish, but I would have loved more of them. It wasn't a bad attempt, but it wasn't memorable or worthy of repeating, in my opinion.Our waitress was friendly, as was the hostess. Service was a bit slow, and things didn't seem particularly busy while we were there. However, I liked the atmosphere, so I wasn't too bothered by the longer-than-expected visit.",Marisa B.,,,,,,

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,2/20/17,"Came here with the fiancÌ© for a delayed Valentine's Day dinner on Friday. We had a difficult time finding parking, especially with the game going in, so we ended up using the valet. FiancÌ© was crying as he watched the valet stall his car. The food overall was very good. We got a loaf of bread with really good olive oil and pesto (?), and I probably at 3/4 of the loaf. We ordered bruschetta to start, but neither of us read the menu and didn't realize it came with prosciutto on top. I ended up picking it off, and the waitress mentioned that next time we could order a vegetarian bruschetta with asparagus on top instead. Good to know! The bruschetta was also quite oily- FH ended up not finishing one of his slices because it felt too buttery and messy and made his stomach feel weird. FH had his normal dish, the chicken Marsala. It was super tasty and he cleaned the plate up. I had the penne alla vodka, and the noodles tasted homemade. It was tasty, but I was so full from all the bread that I ate that I ended up taking most of it home. It didn't reheat that well, but it was alright. I would order it again. In conclusion, the meal was pretty average. I would eat it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. As we were leaving, the valet took an extra long time to get FH's car. We were there for quite a while. When he finally arrived, he had gotten the seat stuck forward and apologized for taking so long as the garage was backed up.

We couldn't help but order the special for the evening:  bacon wrapped giant scallops on top of creamy cheese/bacon/jalapeno risotto (was not hot spicy, just savory).Their cocktails are really great.  I would at least try one and then a glass from the wonderful wine list.We said no to dessert......AT FIRST.  Then the waiter described the bread pudding.  We were sold and it was delicious!

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,1,2012/4/17,Wtf Martini? We ate here on Friday and somehow they charged our credit card TWICE for a total of over 500 bucks! Martini blamed it on our bank! Good grief! That NEVER happens. After multiple phone calls over four days our bank proved that it was indeed Martini's fault and they did bill us twice! A lame and clueless apology was given after considerable hassle for us. No attempt to offset this with offer of a gift card or anything at all. Luckily we had enough in the bank to cover their very large error. Someone else might not be so lucky. Their food was good. But the hassle was not worth it. Check your credit card after eating here.,Mitzie M.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,8/24/17,"Try the butternut squash tortellini - superb! Best pasta dish I've had in the past year.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,12/27/16,"Martini has kept it's high standards and high quality offerings over its tenure. I'm always happily surprised when I come here - it's Italian fare, but Martini sets the bar high.The space itself is upscale, and either bright and airy (for daytime/happy hour drinks) or darkly intimate for a nighttime dinner date. I actually prefer sitting at the bar, which is great for people watching and sports viewing on the ideally-placed TVs. Excellent and personable bartenders and host staff, equally as professional & focused as the servers.If you come to a place called Martini, be prepared to order cocktails. Again, they meet their own standards with quality and well-chosen offerings. On our last trip (a late-night jaunt post-phony-matrimony), the offerings were things like the Testarossa (Jameson, agave nectar, passion fruit, lemon, pio cesare) and Short North Tea (house made limoncello, pama, tea, prosecco, orange juice & mint). I really wanted that tea, but that's an Uber-night for me. I ended up with a ginger citrus martini (belvedere citrus, house made sour mix, agave nectar). Delicious and smooth. Of course, wine and beer are on offer as well.One must-have: Martini's beef Carpaccio. It's one of those BEST THINGS EVER. Every. single. time. never-fail. Just...yes.Martini's entree offerings are straightforward - lasagna, pappardelle, penne alla vodka, veal scaloppini - but they are balanced well and with great execution. No-miss with anything I've had so far.Sadly, I've never made it to dessert (I'm typically drinking it, let's be honest), but of course, if they are anything like other offerings, you won't go wrong.Martini is a great place to impress for a business lunch, happy-hour meetup, or intimate dinner.",Donna O.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,11/30/17,"This was my first time at Martini for a work dinner. I chose the lasagna along with a glass of cab and I was set.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2012/7/16,"The last time I was here was a long time ago. I had liked the ambience but wasn't that impressed with the food. However, i came here recently on a business dinner and the experience was far better. Starting with the server who was incredibly friendly and provided excellent recommendations, everything went perfectly.  For appetizers, we got the calamari, the mozzarella cheese, and the arancini. All three appetizers were delicious. I especially liked the calamari and the arancini. For dinner, based on the server's recommendation I got the lamb shank special with polenta. The lamb was cooked perfectly, melt in your mouth delicious! And the polenta served as a perfect complement. The folks at the table that got the pasta dishes really liked them as well. They cook their pasta fresh. A big plus. An overall excellent experience.",Ness S.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,1/17/17,"Just had dinner here for restaurant week. Our reservation was for 6:45 and we didn't make it to the second course until about 8:30. Our salads/aranchini were good, as was the second course (they accommodated our party by taking the meat out of a couple of these dishes which we appreciated) but the third course - two salmon dishes and one chicken dish were kind of gross. I think it was the quality of the meat. The chicken had this weird processed flavor and the salmon was very salty and lacked flavor otherwise. One person was happy with the short rib he ordered. I think I'll keep going here for happy hours but I'll pass on dinner.",Caitlin K.,,,,,,

We had the lobster risotto, beef carpaccio, and the antipasto plate--you must get every one. We inhaled the food and washed it down with the strong drinks.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2001/8/17,"Been to Martini's a couple of times, typically later on a weekday evening (ie: after 7p).  Usually when we get there the place is pretty busy, but then clears out shortly afterwards.Reservations are recommended as this place is fairly busy.  The bar area is great and both times I was in, there was large container of vodka with pineapple.  The Pineapple infused vodka is fantastic, and whatever their special cocktail is with the vodka, is a definite must try.  Both times we spent a bit of time at the bar and then we were seated.  Both a small group (3), and a larger group (9).  Service both times was excellent, and the servers are very knowledgeable about both the bar and food side, and they were quick to make suggestions.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  Food was also very good.  However, for the amount you pay, I think it could be a bit better.  Meals here are pricey.  Don't get me wrong the meal is good, just not fantastic.The servers are always attentive and very quick to refill water and to get drinks served up.  Overall, I like the place, and for those nicer occasion meals, this is a wonderful place to go.",Randy S.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,4/22/17,"This place is great! Went for Happy Hour and just missed it because I didn't check the times. However this place is worth every penny.  The Pear Elderflower Martini is yummy - slight pear taste and not overly sweet or alcoholic tasting. Next I had the Sangiovese to go with the food. And now the food: the Arancini was sooooo good. You get 6 of them and they are cooked just perfectly with some marinara and cheese topping. Excellent deal even for the regular price. And OMG THE MOZZARELLA!!!! It is made fresh and served warm with crispy bread, roasted tomatoes, and a delicious olive oil pesto. This is a must. I'm sure is changes a bit day to day as it's made fresh etc but so amazing. If you are only getting one thing, get this. I was so impressed and pleased with this great little bar & restaurant!",Katy J.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,7/15/17,"WOW!Group of 7 and I wasn't paying - The place was packed for a Tuesday, mainly business and established people. We had a reservation and the table was ready and waiting. They ordered a few apps per person so I think I tried everything on the app menu. the Fresh Mozzarella and the Beef Capriccio were incredible, so were all the others, but those two stood out.  Six of the seven people ordered some type of veal and everyone's entree was perfect.  I had the Veal Martini and you didn't need a knife, it was scallopini style with prosciutto and arugula.  If they/we didn't order 8 bottles of wine I would have loved to have desert.  The waiter, I forget his name, knew his place, he was so good with the wine he could have been a sommelier.

Great atmosphere but maybe a little loud for a romantic date but perfect for groups or people that want to have a good time. Prices are very reasonable for the level of food and service.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,5/30/17,"The food was really good. The calamari was tender and perfectly seasoned. The mozzarella was a bit stiff however the bread and pesto was great.

Really recommend this for anyone considering eating here.",Azael M.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,1,9/30/17,"We had made 8:30 reservations for my friends birthday and upon arrival were told that our table was not ready but would be shortly which was fine. After being seated and ordering some apps it took at least 20 minutes for them to arrive. Then after finally ordering food it took at least another 30 minutes just to get that as well! I had ordered $39 worth of scallops and they tasted like $10 scallops. They came sitting on a bed of polenta which was super bland and had no flavor what so ever. The scallops were also chewy and lacked salt. The restaurant was really not busy at all but it felt as if our waiter was never present. 1st time here and definitely the last.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,3/29/17,"Oh my god. Let me preface by saying that I went for a dinner that was paid for by a company I'm working with, so if I had been paying my own way, I'd have never gotten to try the many delicacies that this place offers (at a rightful yet somewhat steep cost).First, I had the Precursor, a whiskey/honey cocktail. Get that. Just do it. Then I had the Caesar salad, salmon, and a chocolate mousse torte. Everything was decadent, but the salmon was the highlight for me. My colleagues got the filet and were overwhelmed by its tastiness as well. The Caesar was a touch saltier than I'd have liked, but still great. The mousse was more cakey than moussey (our incredible server did inform me of this beforehand), and it wasn't the best I've had, but I sure had trouble telling myself I did not need to finish it.All in all, I don't usually give Italian places much of my attention, but I would have definitely missed out if this one was not a stop on my conference trip to Columbus.",Kate S.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,2,1/26/17,"Without a doubt the best food I have ever had in Columbus. The most wholesome fettuccine and clams I have had in Ohio and unique yet classic Italian flavors like no other. The ambiance is that of fine-dining without the snobby undertones. With all this positive feedback some may we wondering, why only three stars? Well. While the food and atmosphere were impeccable, the service was less than pleasing.  The floors are so slippery it took me 300 steps just to get to the bathroom. My friend's chair COLLAPSED from underneath her and the management was cracking jokes at her expense. The waiter was rude to my party probably because we looked young and weren't going to spend hundreds of dollars on wine (at 5pm on a week night).  He never mentioned his name, and when we informed him there was a surprise guest coming (aka another place setting) he rolled his eyes and reluctantly got another chair. I have been to Martini before and had a lovely experience but this last dinner put a bad taste in my mouth about the management. Yeah, the food is exceptional but if the service can't match, good luck.",Jennifer E.,,,,,,

I had clams and linguine and it was great with fresh tender clams and great sauce. Friends had chicken parmigiana and all said it was very good.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,4/15/17,"Pleasant date or business dining atmosphere in downtown in trendy and not overly formal feel.  Pros: The food is one of the best Italian I've had in Columbus so far and the server was attentive and wait times to speak with the server and waiting for the food was minimal.    - Malbec was smooth; the bruschetta tasted unique in a good way; The shrimp marinara had good balance of sauce, touch of spice and pasta.  The shrimp aren't too small either.Cons:  Less intimate for quiet conversation as the tables are open and visible to all. Didn't have options for wheat pasta of any kind.  The tuna salad isn't a salad at all, it has sparse greens sprinkled over beans with a slim layer of tuna.  While the bean dish/salad wasn't what I expected, it tasted good.Overall, this semi-fine dining spot was a very pleasant experience and is a good date night or place to hangout with colleagues.",Mee-Jin Y.,,,,,,

Kudos to this man!The hostess, however, was a different matter. As business professionals, we expected a reception that was at least cordial. She, however, literally turned her nose up at us, developed an immediately haughty tone, and couldn't have cracked a smile if her life depended on it. The lack of civility and professionalism was bad enough, but her snotty dismissal as she passed us off to her 'helper' was just perfecting her awfulness.The food was mostly subpar, in my opinion, although a good half of my table companions enjoyed their dishes. Mine was the tenderloin, touted the best in Columbus; it was like ground, wet cardboard, coated with an awful half-cheese sauce that was bitter and uncomplimentary to the dish. A table mate indicated her marinara dish was mediocre.Others, however, had the chicken carbonara, beet salad and the Arctic char (a special) and stated both dishes were delicious. The wine and martini parings were decent as well.Overall, for the price and hype, I would have expected far more in a place of this nature - thus the 2 star.",Kelli L.,,,,,,

The server, Holly, was terrific! She stoof in the kitchen forever waiting for the food to come out. Dinner was delicious. I got the butternut squash tortellini, my mom had the lamb parpadelle, her boyfriend had the lasagna. My boyfriend had the chicken parmesan - not great! Chicken was over cooked. Moral of the story, the food and drinks were great overall, but the food took forever to come out. The manager ended up comping out dinner - which was great, and very nice! Thankfully the food was great, or I would have complained more about how long the food took to come out. One last thing. The toilets in the woman's bathroom are so low to the ground.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,12/22/15,"Came here for our anniversary dinner.  The food is fantastic.  Sweetie got penne in vodka sauce.  I had a bite and it was very good; she loved it.  I had the butternut squash tortellini.  It was amazing.  Tender pasta, subtly flavored filling, nice cream sauce.  I also had a black cherry manhattan that was very good.  I'm not usually a cocktail drinker, so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but the flavors were well-balanced and on the whole it was very enjoyable.  The complimentary bread with oil and pesto was a nice starter.  For dessert we shared the vanilla brulee.  Very good, but not the best I've ever had.  The sugar was super thick and hard to crack through.  The custard was light and good.  The cookies on the side were fantastic.Some negatives: half-full on a Monday evening, the place was incredibly loud.  Conversations, kitchen noise, all kinds of craziness.  We could barely talk.  I don't know why places are designed to reflect noise.  Acoustic tile is your friend; minimalist design may look good, but if it is unpleasant to sit there...The table-side serving was weird.  The kitchen is right there- is it that hard to get plates to the table before they cool?  Lots of scraping and awkwardness for our server; if it had been busy I don't know how she could have done it.  Overall, the food was amazing, the service was good, the prices were fair for what you get, and the atmosphere was okay but not awful.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,1,2006/9/17,"My husband and I just had the worst experience tonight in this restaurant. We were out for a special evening and made a reservation at this restaurant which was close to our hotel.  We walked in to the bar area which was very loud so after waiting for the hostess, we requested a quiet table. She sat us at a table right next to the bar. We placed our order and got our wine and salad within a reasonable time. After waiting for an hour for our entree, and seeing that people around us who came later have been served already, the waitress finally told us that she forgot to push the button for our order so it was just being prepared then. She apologized and a few minutes later the manager came to apologize also.  Well, by that time, we were quite upset for waiting so long and our special evening was ruined. We wanted to leave but she assured us that the food will be out in 5 minutes. When our food finally came, 10 minutes later, (we both ordered the fettuccine with clams), it was so bad we couldn't eat it and left them practically untouched. The pasta was overcooked, the sauce was too soupy and had overpowering taste of butter.  They seem to drown everything there with butter. The croutons on our Ceasar salads were so soaked in butter that you couldn't taste the bread.  There is nothing authentic Italian style in this restaurant. But, the worst part is the service.  When we got our check, they had the nerve to charged us for everything inspite of the very poor service that they admitted to and seeing that we didn't touch the food. Who among you customers out there, would think that this was appropriate?  What decent and reputable restaurant would admit to being responsible for the bad service and not accommodate or compensate a customer for what they put them through. Totally classless, not to mention bad food, bad service.",Mary Ann G.,,,,,,

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,12/21/15,"'Martini' -- a word that leaves little up to the imagination and/or much room for interpretation -- delivers the exact dining experience that its name evokes. Boozy, shallow, antiquated and sweet, Martini is the restaurant equivalent of a mid-2000s cosmopolitan. Small doses of bright neon have arguably made a comeback (Major Food Group does this well with places like Dirty French, Santina and Carbone), but Martini utilizes bright pink lights sincerely and in excess. The restaurant will apparently undergo a renovation, which is great, and should start by removing the vinyl covers from the outside of its sparkling chandeliers. This cost-effective solution represents half the battle.The food at Martini mixes occasionally-clever technique with outdated Italian cliches, and is equally hit and miss. While my arctic char special showed promise and great care, with its rich truffle butter sauce, earth mushrooms, and bright frisee salad, the majority of appetizers fell flat, showing little creativity or ingenuity. And don't get me started on what was sold to me as ""the best creme brulee in columbus"", which came in a bathtub and had no flavor whatsoever, one of the worst I've ever had. The strawberry semifreddo, with its delicate balance of sweet and subtle, frozen and thaw, is the far superior option.The one area that Martini shines is the service: fast, friendly and knowledgeable. Then again, after the lukewarm creme brulee sent me running to the men's room, I was forced to delay the inevitable thanks to a small mob of festive kitchen staffers, who were quite loud about their happiness that the night was coming to an end. Soon thereafter, so was I, on both fronts.",Malcolm K.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2009/6/17,In town for a convention and found this gem! The food is amazing and the service and atmosphere topped off a great experience overall.  Anytime in town I am definitely going straight back to martini to try more menu items. Braised lamb dish is highly recommended and feel free to switch up your pasta of choice. They do not mind. Highly recommend !,C U.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,9/15/17,"Veal and Chicken Parmesan are good. Doesn't taste like regular Italian like you would get at a normal Italian place. On the Veal Parmesan plate the pasta and arugula had contrasting flavors to the Veal Parmesan which made it all taste better together. The sauce was light and had a strong tomato taste which pared well with the other flavors. It was very busy even on a Tuesday, call ahead for reservations.",Jeremy P.,,,,,,

Our server Ronn was so great. The interior is beautiful and I loved the chandeliers. I can't talk highly enough about the food. I had the chicken Marsala and it was cooked perfectly. Everyone loved their food! Our server Ronn was nice enough to split the bride-to-be's food and drink on all of our separate tabs. This was above and beyond my expectations.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2010/4/15,"Came on a Saturday night at 5:45 before the ballet. We were promptly seated in a nice empty part of the restaurant. The decor and ambiance is wonderful and was perfect for our ladies night but could also be a great date location. The waitress was very attentive and our glasses were always filled. I ordered the lamb Pappardelle, which was served out of a hot pan table side, it was delicious and very meaty. My friend ordered the Milanese, also delicious. Very crisp and covered in a thick great cheese. Other friend ordered chicken Marsala, very delicate and good as well. We split the chocolate bread pudding which was a hefty serving and very good. We also split a tiramisu. The tiramisu was a real winner, the cup it was served in was entirely made of chocolate! It was amazing! Only 4 stars because the food could have been a step up. But Id definitely return.",Jessica P.,,,,,,

I loved the juicy tomatoes and how fresh and light the panzanella salad was. I had the sea bass special served with gnocchi and arugula and I ate every bite. The gnocchi is cooked just how I like it- pan seared so it's just slightly crispy on the outside. I don't eat beef, but my husband had the veal martini (rated good)  and another friend had the ribeye (rated excellent).",Sarah H.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2001/6/17,"Their filet is hands down my favorite filet in Columbus... and quite possibly anywhere.The chicken carbonara is really good too. They use fresh squeezed orange juice when making my mixed drink. Even with Reservations i usually have to wait a couple minutes for my table. Use the valet when you go because the garage parking will cost you just as much. Service is usually really good, i have been here many many times and i can only think of one or two occasions that i thought service was sub par.",Rachel P.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2004/4/16,"If you're looking for a cool, swanky restaurant in the Short North, check out Martini!  We went for a surprise birthday dinner, and they were very accomodating throughout the entire evening.  The menu is a bit pricey, but honestly, the food was great and the portions were big!  I had the calamari appetizer- it tasted very fresh and was actually served on a bed of greens.  For my entree, I ordered (and loved) the lamb pappardelle.  The pasta is made fresh, in-house, and was perfectly sauced.  There was so much!!!  I finished it, but was very full afterward.  Their desserts sounded too good to pass up, so I got the lemon meringue.  It was good, but I liked the strawberry shortcake and bread pudding desserts better!",Rami M.,,,,,,

Let me just add this visit was loooonnggg overdue. I always walk past this gem gallery hopping and love the window fronts..  I made a reservation for us a week in advance, and requested a window seat in the comments. When we got there, it felt like VIP service! The hostess walked us right over to our table, and removed the reserved sign right off the window seat table :) We had a wonderful evening. I decided to try their lasagna which was divine. Every bite was a bite of pure glory. The appetizers were great and all in all service was exceptional.

We came here on a Tuesday evening and ordered the mozzarella cheese appetizer to share and it was soooo good- I am a major cheese lover. We also split the Chicken Marsala and Butternut Squash Tortellini.. Both were amazing dishes but it was a good idea to split, that way you can break up the richness. The Marsala was almost like a thanksgiving dinner (yum!) and the Squash was suggested as their most favorite (which is was very very good) just also very very rich and creamy. On the service.. We sat at the bar, and the bar tenders seemed very attentive to almost everyone else except us.. We had to remind them we ordered an appetizer, as well as our dinner. I still highly recommend Martini.. It's definitely delicious Italian!",Whitney S.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,9/30/16,Took a customer here for dinner the other night and had an excellent meal.  It's a smaller restaurant with the bar taking up about 1/3 of the place.  Tables are pretty tight making it a loud place but it's perfect for the atmosphere they're trying to get.  It's a hip place and certainly popular with the cool kids in town.  Place was packed on a Wednesday night.  Point being don't go for a quiet cozy meal.  The bruschetta app was fantastic. I personally had the chicken piccata and although it was a bit on the small side it was perfectly prepared.  I highly recommend but be sure to make a reservation.,John R.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,1,2001/3/15,"Not pleased. The waiter treated us differently the minute we deferred an appetizer and it continued our entire visit (we were on a time limit and couldn't stay all night). My boyfriend also ordered a beer because he cannot drink anything else, another point against us. The service was less than satisfactory and that alone is the reason we won't return. Our food was fine. Marsala with few mushrooms and veal raviolis with minimal veal. The atmosphere is cool and a reason I'd justify the costs but, I can pay less and be treated way better anywhere else in Columbus.",Jordan N.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,2,12/14/15,"Been here a few times and no complaints but this time everyone complained about an overcooked filet. We were a party of 11 and spent about $1500 but the only good part were the drinks. One person complained about the steak and they remade it perfectly but if the rest of us that ordered filets had complained it would've just been rude and probably end up in a kitchen scene of the movie Waiting. But seriously, I personally won't be back and I doubt the team will be back. If we weren't drunk it would've been worse. Thanks but no thanks.",Will Y.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,3/25/16,"Stopped in for happy hour with some co-workers on Wednesday evening. Had two 5$ Martinis which were amazing and the ahi tar tar, also amazing. The pineapple infused vodka looked fun although I didn't order it, very unique. Service was good at first then they got busier and my bartender stopped checking back and I had to awkwardly stare her down to try to get another drink. One of my co workers showed up late and sat down approximately 10 minutes before happy hour was over and she was never offered a drink or help even after I tried to get their attention for her. So of course at 6pm the drink prices more than doubled and my co worker had a unhappy hour despite waiting.",Mason T.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,7/18/16,Definitely yes! I took clients there for a meal and although they were packed the service was awesome.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2008/5/16,"We chose this restaurant because of its proximity to the hotel we were at for a conference and were pleasantly surprised!  Ive found that often places near hotels stay in business because of convenience rather than great food or service. Not the case here. 4 of us had drinks, apps, dinner, and dessert and we all thoroughly enjoyed every aspect!  Service and food were both very good!  It's a great choice - you won't be disappointed.",Chris P.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,2,2/20/16,"I'll start with the positive. I ordered the sausage campanella and it was delicious. The basil sauce was great, although I wish they had added more sausage. However, the portion was pretty good and I actually shared it with two other people. We also ordered the antipasto della case and it was okay, nothing to rave about. Now the bad. We went on a Saturday night at 8 pm and the service was awful. It took forever for the waitress to come once we were seated. Once she finally came it took forever for her to bring out bread and we had to ask her for it. She said it was busy, but I noticed she kept talking to the other tables around us and staying with them much longer. I had to keep flagging her down for stuff, such as getting more water and getting the check. When we finally asked for the check it took forever as well. Overall, the food was great but it wasn't worth it. Perhaps at other times it's better.",Veronica P.,,,,,,

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2003/7/16,"I decided to order something off the menu that I had never tried here before and selected the scallops. They were amazing! The sauce they came in helped bring out the flavor, and the greens made a wonderful addition. I had the tiramisu for my birthday dessert and if it's possible, it tasted even better than it's ""coffee in a mug"" appearance. I tried the Testatrossa cocktail with Jameson whiskey and passion fruit, I definitely recommend even if you don't like whiskey.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,1,12/31/16,"Understand it was after the holidays,but understaffed and it was reflected in the unfriendly attitude of our waitress. My meal was the worse example of chicken piccata I have eaten, not only taking into consideration that after eating half of it noticed it was raw. Had a few days of an upset stomach, and will need to analyze every piece of chicken I eat for awhile. Husbands veal chop was good, but being new to Columbus there are plenty of other options.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,2007/7/16,"Loud, overpriced, overrated, and HORRIBLE marinara.I could stop there, as the marinara alone should be reason enough to stay away. If an ""Italian"" restaurant can't get marinara right, it shouldn't be in business. In fairness, the butternut squash tortelloni were fantastic and the veal chop that one of my dining companions ordered was delicious (but still overpriced). I had the vitello milanese. The veal itself was very tasty and tender, but the pool of marinara was not at all like the light, delicate pomodoro sauce that should accompany good veal milanese. It did nothing to enhance the dish; if anything, it detracted from it. The ball of fettucine that constituted the starch of the dish had literally nothing on it and was flavorless. And the terrible marinara, again, only made it worse. Absolutely not worth the $27 or $29 I was charged. And to make matters worse, it was so loud in the restaurant that the three of us had to nearly shout to have a conversation. Finally, when one of my dining companions mentioned my review of the marinara to the server...crickets. No one else dropped by to ask, and no attempt to compensate in any way was made.I won't be back, although I wouldn't mind it if someone scored me some more of those tortelloni...",Matt M.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2010/11/15,"Went back a year later and I have to say it's just as good as when I was there the first time. To start the martini's are a nice size, then we had the mozzarella, antipasto and the calamari appetizer all was great but I have to say the calamari was a bit to small. For dinner we hade the veal chop which was great, Chicken parmesan which is alway good and the butternut squash with tortellini also wonderful. For desert tiramisu which was fresh and made fresh. I'll be back but make sure you make a reservation",Paul B.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,6/20/14,"Martini Modern was one of my favorite finds while visiting Columbus.   The restaurant is an open concept with the bar in the front and the main dining area towards the back, and you could even see the kitchen. The decor was stunning, especially the three chandeliers, it is something best seen and not easily captured in photo. The dim lighting also adds to the ambiance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offered a Gluten Friendly Menu (as they note they are not a completely GF kitchen), pasta included. It surprisingly had a decent amount of options. The food and service was good. The drinks were what stole the show. The Short North Tea, which they had to slightly modify to be completely GF, was phenomenal. I would warn that one could easily drink these too quickly. The sweetness of the does a good job at masking how strong these suckers truly are.Martini's also offered one of the best gluten free breads I have had in awhile. It is the Chef's recipe and he has done a nice job of perfecting the recipe. It reminded me of eating actual bread and not the usual cardboard tasting offerings that other restaurants like to pass off as GF bread.If your looking for a place for romantic date or an intimate dinner with friends or even a chili and relaxing dinner, then Martini Modern Italian is the place for you. If you are a penny-pincher and don't like spending $30+ a person, then this isn't a place for you.",Stacy P.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2/27/16,"I absolutely love this place.  The food and drinks are delicious and the bartenders are awesome!

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,1,7/16/16,"Extremely rude management.   Called three weeks ahead of a scheduled work happy hour for a reservation in the front of the restaurant as we like to enjoy sitting near the windows.   I was told they NEVER accept reservations for those tables - they are first come first serve.   So, I arrived at 4:05pm, as they open at 4pm, was seated around 4:30 (I was the first customer in the restaurant) and at 6:30pm we were asked to leave due to a reservation.   Since I called way in advance and was told they NEVER accept reservations, but yet told us we had to leave for a reservation?!  On top of that, the manager was extremely rude - she didn't even care one bit.   Extremely poor customer service.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,12/30/16,"Service-wise, everything was perfect. Our server was very attentive and friendly, drinks were kept filled (and we got a free dessert because it was T's birthday!)The food left much to be desired. We got tuna crudo for an appetizer, which was very fresh-tasting and delicious. We also shared a spinach and pear salad. Now, for a salad that has ""pear"" in the name, there was a distinct absence of pear. C got a few slivers, T got none. For dinner, C got the special, which was a combo of scallops and jumbo shrimp. Sadly, the shrimp were overcooked (which was surprising) and the scallops' sear was a little on the light side. It was also garnished with a watermelon(?) radish that didn't seem to belong on the plate. However, it was served with a risotto that was pretty good. T got the veal milanese. It was pounded a little thinner than liked, and as a result, the meat was dry. For dessert, we shared the tiramisu, which itself was delicious, but it was topped with a mountain of whipped cream and inside of a chocolate teacup, which kinda killed the flavor. But it was free, can't complain too much about that.  The service was good, but for the prices, we would think that the food would be better.",T And C.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,2007/1/15,"Updated Review:It had been a little over a year since going here, and I have to say that the second time around wasn't as great. My BF and I went for dinner on a typical Friday night, wasn't too busy, but was still a full dining room. The food was good, just what I remembered from last time, but the service was subpar. Our waitress was out in left field, the first thing she said when she got to our table was how she wished she could pull my hair color off (weird? yes). She kinda stood there awkwardly and then asked about drinks. This behavior continued through the rest of the evening. It was almost as if she walked off the street and started working. We noticed that other tables had bread, so I flagged down a manager and asked for some.. UGH.Though the food was fine, and the atmosphere was fine, this is not the kind of service I wanted or expected. We could have went to Bucca de Beppo for cheaper. Based on that alone, I won't come back. I had been looking forward to this night about for quite some time, and the service really put a damper on it. Bummer._________First reviewRecently went here for the first time. We had reservations for 8:15pm, but waited quite a bit after, to get a table. The manager (Im assuming she was), apologized many times, and comped our appi and dessert! She came over quite a few times during our meal, to make sure we were enjoying our food.The environment was a bit loud, it was a Sat. night. The food was really good, and wine was just as well!I enjoyed myself, and the consideration that was given for my date and I, for waiting so long after our reservation.",Krystle S.,,,,,,

They didn't give me bread until I was half way through my main course but they zealously offered bread to the girl next to me even though she wasn't eating. They were eager to please others at the bar but it took forever to even get one of them to order dessert. No one gave a crap and I couldn't even get water refill. I was almost forgotten. I rarely gave a waiter/waitress below 18% tips and today was the day. McDonalds sometimes has better service than this.,Mike S.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2003/9/15,"This is a chic contemporary designed restaurant that's exquisite in every way. We've hosted large party dinners two years in a row and the menu is creative modern Italian cuisine that's delicious and in good portion. Everyone raved about the service and wine list. The appetizers were practically fought over, (kidding) but we resorted to ordering more. We indulged in the Beef Carpaccio, Calamari and Pizettas.Our entrees were perfectly prepared. I definitely recommend the Chicken Carbonara, Filet Mignon (which is prepared with a red wine...superb), Salmon or the Butternut Squash. There was not one complaint, only raves from our guests. I especially appreciate the conscientious wait staff who gave honest suggestions on popular menu items and favorites. Everyone was professional and incredibly friendly.  Being that we took 60+ guests last year for our event, we saw many return on their own this year (separate from our group dinner we planned this year).I plan corporate dinners in Los Angeles to Miami to Las Vegas, Indianapolis, etc. throughout the year.

Only disappointment to me was the free bread, which was completely tasteless to me! Guy next to me was eating the butternut squash tortelloni and it looked delicious, and the other guy near me was eating the Papardelle with lamb ragu, I believe, and he seemed to be loving it judging by the way he was licking the plate!",Jason B.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2011/11/15,"Best Chicken Marsala I've ever had.  Everything was perfect last Friday night.  There were four of us and we couldn't have been happier.  Started with great cocktails and appetizers.  Our server, John was fantastic.  He knew the menus well and had spot on recommendations.  Our entire meal was delicious and the wine he suggested was wonderful.  The table had pasta, scallops and the Marsala.  Everything was really good.

Expect to pay a good amount but you are getting the quality that you deserve.They have a great bar staff that makes really diverse and fun cocktails. The wine selection was amazing as well and we had our fair share of bottles. Not to mention or waiter who was really on his Ps and Qs about the menu and had great pairings for drinks.Waited a few extra minutes for our table but nothing extreme.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2004/2/16,"Came here for dinner. Our fabulous waiter recommended the beet salad. So I did and it was delicious. I love beets but my friend doesn't so I got her to try it and she also loved it. I also ordered the butternut squash. I feel like a lot of people said it was creamy, the thing about this dish is that it is creamy but it's very lite. It's not heavy and that's why I really enjoyed this dish. It was the perfect.",Summer T.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,10/23/16,"Visited Columbus recently and went to this restaurant based on Yelp reviews. The atmosphere was very nice. Our service was very good. They were attentive but didn't rush us. We had the fresh made mozzarella and pesto. So good I wish we had ordered two. The beet salad and the panzanella salad were both really good. We had four entrees and had a hard time deciding which one was the best they were all so good. We had the filet, the lamb pappardelle, the beef brisket and the shrimp marinara. Would love to go back to this place again. Wish we lived closer!!",Jeanette T.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,1/23/14,"My most recent dining experience here was last night for Restaurant Week. Luckily, there was no wait, so we were able to be seated right away. The Martini staff is excellent and very attentive; there are multiple people always refilling water glasses, so there's no chance of going parch! The food is consistently good. I highly recommend the fresh mozzarella appetizer- freshly made when ordered, this thin piece of warm mozzarella comes with several slices of toasted focaccia, their house made pesto, and the most delicious roasted tomatoes I have ever had!I can also vouch for their beef carpaccio appetizer, which is my absolute favorite. It's hard to go there and NOT order it!!The butternut squash tortelloni was very good, without being over the top rich like I thought it would be. Think massive tortelloni- the shape is a blend of tortellini and ravioli, with lots of creamy squash filling! The cream sauce nicely compliments the tortelloni without over powering it, and the few brussels sprout leaves and crushed marcona almonds provides a nice texture contrast.The short ribs are pretty good- I have to say I rarely order short ribs so can't be too critical. They were a tad on the fatty side, but I guess that's what short ribs are. The creamy polenta was delicious, as was the reduction of whatever that saucy goodness was on top of it. I have had the lamb papperdelle a few times, too- that is probably my staple dish there. AND, if you somehow have room for dessert after the end of the meals, I highly recommend the chocolate bread pudding. OMG my mouth is watering just thinking about it!!Good food and great service, what more can you ask for? The only ""hiccup"" we experienced with restaurant week was the fact that the second and third courses came out together about five minutes after we got our appetizer. We politely asked them if they would mind keeping it warm while we finished our appetizer, which they had no issue doing. They then brought the second course and followed with the third course after we finished. Can't wait to come back!",Amy S.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,3/26/15,The atmosphere was very chill and it was kind of high class. The white oval bar was pretty cool but didn't get to sit there. The bruschetta was awesome. The portions for entrees were slightly small but tasted great. Martins menu was very big but a given because of the name of the restaurant. I would recommend this place to anyone for dinner and you might want to have a reservation.,Sidney H.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,1,12/28/15,"Food: I love Cameron Mitchell restaurants, for me the Ocean Club is the best restaurant in Columbus.  However, our meal at Martini's was horrible.  The calamari was the worst I've ever had, and the parmesan chicken was dry with a tomato sauce that tasted like it came out of a can. I would say you could get better at the frozen food department at the grocery store.Service: The waiter was friendly enough, and the wait for our food reasonable.  However, we were one of the last three tables of the evening, and apparently our waitress decided to tend to some closing tasks and left us.  It took us a good 15 minutes just to get the bill.Major pro: 50% off wine bottles less than $100 on Sunday's.  This was the only bright spot of the meal.Summary: Totally sub-par food, especially when you figure the price you're paying.",Michael M.,,,,,,

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2/26/13,"I have to say I was pleasently surprised by this place.  I really did not know what to expect and had a crappy day so was expecting a not so stellar, yet overpriced dinner.  Martini delivered 5 stars on every level in my opinion. Upon entering, we were greeted by a super nice host... quite chipper given the dreary weather I must say!  We were immediately sat at our table as we awaited our other guest who was going to be a few minutes behind us.  The server, Michael I believe was his name, was on the ball... made sure we had waters immediately and asked if we wanted anything while we waited for our guest.  We got the Calamari app and salads... I got the Arugula one... LOVED it.  I am becoming a huge fan of them and theirs was pretty awesome.  Some places do not get the right mix of sweet/salty/bitter... they did and that is what I think makes the salad. All three of us got the Scallop dinner special with orzo.  To die for!  I would go back and drive the 3+ hours to get there just to have this again (that is how good I thought it was). Great service, nice atmosphere and awesome food makes this a great choicw if you are ever in the Columbus area looking for downtown grub.",Faith A.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,4/29/13,"Tourists are we, and we wandered around Short North for a bite to eat.  We hit upon Martini's and are so glad we did.  It was busy in there but we couldn't tell as our waitstaff was very attentive.  Nice ambiance, lower lighting, excellent waitstaff, hostesses, and though I didn't see them, the cooks are excellent. The menu is not large, but there is plenty to choose.  I didn't see any eggplant parm, and I asked the waiter about it.  She said they would make it, even though it's not on the menu.  My sister and I decided to split an order and get a Caesar salad to go with it.  The salad was pretty darn good.  Yes, it was a simple salad but the homemade croutons!!!! They  seemed soaked in butter but not soggy.  Just flavorful and a tad crunchy.  I was delighted that the croutons were not square, they were hand torn.  Nice touch!   The eggplant came out, and was I ever happy with it. There were two large thick  pieces of eggplant, not peeled, atop linguine and tomato sauce, and cooked to perfection with mozzarella on top and baked til bubbly.  My sister and I split the eggplant, and it's a good thing we did.  It seemed we each got a full portion.   Of course I asked for the fresh parmesan to be put atop, big 1"" curls of the stuff. YUM.  There was so much eggplant that I ate only a bit of the linguine, which was firm and done to perfection. My sister had chicken carbonara and ate every bit.  Other sister had butternut squash ravioli, and although I am not a fan and evidently  neither is she, I am sure that someone out there will like it. It was definitely homemade, not ordered from a supplier. Butternut squash isn't for everyone.  The bread and pesto and dipping oil  were outstanding.  There were a lot of prom groups dining so this tells me Martini's has a good reputation.  I will definitely be back if  ever get the chance to go to Columbus again.",Theresa N.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2006/8/15,"Like all of the Mitchell Restaurants: high priced and moderate food items, set in a pleasant, welcoming atmosphere. The food was to be desired, based on the cost.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2009/3/15,"I was in town aug 31- sept 3 for my nephews open heart surgery. I stayed at the Hilton next door to here & I stole my sister away from the hospital for a bit to treat her to a nice dinner. Our waitress (I can't remember her name ) was so sweet. Very informative with the menu. I had the grapefruit gimlet to drink. Very refreshing! My sister ordered the chicken carbonara & I had the penne alla vodka sauce. They were both amazing!! The waitress asked where we were from, told her OK & the story about my nephew. She said she would be praying for him. A few minutes later, the manager came out. She said the waitress told her about my nephew & she wanted to take of dessert for us, & wanted to send one back to the hospital for my brother in law. Then she said, anytime you want food, call & we will deliver it to the hospital for you, because you need to eat good while you're here! They don't usually deliver.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2001/8/16,You definitely have to love $5 martini's during happy hour.  To go along with a delicious beverage are half-priced appetizers which do not disappoint.  I especially enjoy their antipasto della casa for both the flavor and the quantity.  Another 'perk' if you will are the large windows (which open when it's nice out) which allow you to enjoy the vibrant city while sipping an ice cold martini.  The only downside to is they tend to get quite busy once they open so be sure to stop by early.,Craig P.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2010/12/15,"I ate here with a large group during a training weekend.  I got the modern Italian twist right away when I perused the menu.  I ended up getting the special, which was expertly done salmon with gnocchi and some field greens.  Our table split the bruschetta and calamari appetizers, and just about everyone got either a glass of wine or a signature martini.  Oh, and that bread?  Fabulous.  Loved the pesto, and it was an interesting change of pace to eat slightly sweet, very light Italian bread.  Everyone's food looked amazing, and several of us ate the salmon and agreed that it was a great dish.  We ordered four desserts to share as well, and all were tasty, but the tiramisu was a bit off in terms of the ratio of ladyfingers and espresso to cream.  It seemed to be mostly cream, really.  The chocolate torte was pretty mind-blowing, though, and I ended up polishing off the last of it when it made its way down to my end of the table. My only gripe about the restaurant overall--and it's not a deal breaker for returning, I assure you--is that it's a bit dark inside, and very, VERY loud.  It was difficult to have a conversation even with the person next to you.  This is a great place with fantastic food, though, so I'd recommend it to others looking for a solid option in downtown Columbus.",Maria B.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,12/27/12,"Martini was around when I still lived in Columbus back in the '90's and I thought that through the years, the focus kind of shifted to Marcella's and Martini was the 5th wheel of the Cameron Mitchell restaurants.  I'm happy to say I was wrong.  Martini was a fresh, welcome surprise.  My partner and I dined here a few days before Christmas and had a great meal. I don't remember Martini being this upscale and food focused.  We started with the tuna crudo which was awesome. For my entree I went with the short rib.  There was a little chunk of fat but overall it was a good dish. My partner had the veal martini and he loved it.  Desserts were okay but not as good as the rest of the meal.  Our server was engaging and paced our meal perfectly so we could enjoy our night.Martini is definitely not the ""red headed stepchild"" of the Cameron Mitchell group.  It stands out as one of the better restaurants in the city.",Steve S.,,,,,,

I expected a better martini at a place named for them...We started with the mozzarella appetizer - nice flavor; the pesto was good. I ordered the Marsala - it was good. My date ordered the tuna, which was cooked perfectly and quite tasty. Our server never returned to check on us. We sat for a very long time after we finished eating.

Although, I can still justify all the great things about Martini due to us being there before we were engaged!The staff is wonderful, great attitudes, great wait staff, all seemed very very helpful! It was obviously a surprise with the engagement, but my Fiance had a lot of help from the Manager and Staff in the planning process. They created, what looked like a menu and gave it to me calling it the ""Specials,"" which was actually the proposal. The staff had arranged to provide a dozen roses after the proposal as well as two glasses of Champagne, which was a great help to my Fiance, because he said he was beyond nervous for proposal and they assisted with everything to make it run smoothly!Besides a fantastic memory... the food is delicious and we have never had any complaints.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2005/2/12,"Have been here several times for drinks at the bar and twice for dinner in the dining room since the remodel. One of the few places in Columbus where servers are well-trained in fine dining service. Service wasn't rushed, but nothing lagged either.Must try the mozzarella appetizer; housemade, it literally starts as curds. Served with crostini, tomato and a delicious pesto. Though I think it is best without the pesto bc of the quality of the cheese. Bread was served warm, maybe have changed this as mentioned in other reviews.Also ordered:Caesar salad-hubby loved he could order anchovies. Dressing made with anchovy paste--as it should be.Seared Scallops on creamy polenta. Perfect carmelized sear, as it should be.Chicken Paremesan (no ordinary chx parm) Lightly pan fried, precisely topped with rigatoni and melted mozzarella, ensuring a perfect bit.Chocolate bread pudding--the best of both worlds: bread pudding and the chocolate hazelnut melts when cut like a lava cake.Coffee-don't underestimate the power of a good cup of coffee at the end of a meal. didn't disappoint.Cocktails:Short North Tea.

Sure, you can get great food, wine or service other places but for all three to be nothing short of spectacular at the same place?  Amazing!We came on a Friday night while visiting Columbus from the East Coast and didn't realize what a gem we had stumbled upon. We had a great little table for two near the back but on a raised up level where we could see the bar and most of the dining area.  It was a vibrant place, busy but not obnoxiously crowded.  Our waitress Jonida was warm, let us dine at our pace, had fabulous recommendations and really was like a friend by the end of our meal.  We knew just from talking to her when we first sat down that we would be enjoying ourselves.We began with a great bottle of Barolo ( which they assisted on selection after we had narrowed it down) that was every bit as fruity AND full as promised.  I always appreciate when the restaurant actually suggests the less expensive of two bottles.  Next we ordered calamari - so lightly breaded.  I think my husband ate every bit of the flavorful peppers on the dish.  The house bread is also light, not dense, and the fresh house made basil pesto alone is worth writing home about. I usually pass on bread to save room but this was worth the indulgence.We continued to struggle with decisions since the entire menu looked appealing.  Jonida saved us by offering that we could have half orders of the pasta so our next dish was a half order of the lamb pappardelle.  Good thing she brought the bread earlier because after we finished this dish, we used it to soak up the fabulous Chianti wine reduction that remained on the plate!  The braised lamb was so tender and flavorful and the half portion was just enough.Our third course was our toughest decision but we went big with the tenderloin and the scallops.  Jonida recommended the tenderloin and of course she didn't steer us wrong here either.  Both were cooked to absolute melt in your mouth perfection.  The kind of dishes that makes you close your eyes after you take a bite, just savoring the flavor and textures. Some espresso and bread pudding and we were two of the happiest people on the planet!  As we ended our meal, we decided this is one of the best dining experiences we have ever had, comparing it to some of our favorite meals in Tuscany over the years.  Really, truly exceptional.  If we were local we would be regulars and can't wait for our next trip to Columbus.",Michelle F.,,,,,,

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,5/24/14,"I'm sad to be leaving a 3 star review, because historically Martini has been one of my favorite restaurants in Columbus.  I came here for an outing with friends.  The food and drinks were great - most of my review is based on a style of service that the restaurant has adopted that isn't to my taste.Four of us ordered cocktails.  Instead of bringing the cocktails, prepared glasses were set before us, and our server came with a shaker, shook our cocktails, and then strained them into our glasses - which might have been cool except she was shaking the shakers everywhere while she strained them and we all got splashed with cocktail.  Also two of the cocktails were martinis, which should be stirred, not shaken.We'd had lots of time to look over the menu, but when she came to take our orders, she talked us through the entire thing as if we weren't capable of reading and comprehending the menu items on our own.I ordered the nightly special, which I admit to being underwhelmed by.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2005/8/15,"Went here twice, was rather disappointed the first time.  I had ordered the salmon and for dessert tiramisu, the salmon, while meant to be subtle in taste, bordered more upon the bland, while the tiramisu was dressed up as a cup of coffee, which was aesthetically pleasing.  However it was overwhelmed with more of the cream than anything else. Went back the second night and had the chicken carbonara and was not disappointed. I had forgone dessert as it was late and it was too warm in the restaurant.  I will say the rest of my party truly enjoyed their selections of wine, rave reviews on that!",Lauren T.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,3/19/16,"I've been here twice, I had the butternut squash tortoloni both times which was fantastic. The calamari, fresh mozzarella, and arancini appetizers are wonderful starters. I also suggest the pear and spinach salad.",Deborah G.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,2008/2/15,"Martini's has nice atmosphere, moderate lighting and medium noise level. I ordered the fettuccine & clams which did not look like the picture on the website but was still tasty. It was buttery with good flavor. I would have like some citrus to cut the buttery rich taste and a little more clam. We got the chocolate tort for dessert and it was delicious. Light and rich at the same time, the chocolate and peanut flavors were amazing. Overall, a pricy place with food where other places can replicate for less. Basically you pay for the atmosphere.",Karen M.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2004/2/15,My staff and I were visiting from Indiana and staying in a near by hotel. For dinner we decided to pick this restaurant. The interior of the building is beautiful. I love that the bar is set up in the front and the seating area for the restaurant is the the back. The place was packed when we dined. I was not surprised because the food was super good. The restaurant is expensive. It does have $$$ as the expense. So if you are okay with that. I would recommend it.,Ayla W.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,8/30/15,"We went here for our 18 wedding anniversary and everything was excellent! I recommend the Mozzarella and Lobster Risotto for appetizers. Service was on point!

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,8/31/13,"Like the vast majority of the 99 reviewers before me I have taken enjoyment in my visits to Martini. I've arrived for dinner a couple times, but most of my experience has been at the bar. The ambiance is on the modern side and the dress ranges from nice-casual to business suits.As mentioned by many others they have an excellent dark cherry manhattan. It can come off a bit sweet if you aren't expecting it, but as someone who has a deep appreciation for whiskey and whiskey related beverages I approve of it. They also do fairly well at making an Old Fashioned (my favorite cocktail). In fact I usually judge all upscale sorts of places in some part on that cocktail, and they have passed... for now.The wine special on Sunday evenings is something to make a trip for as well. One can get a lovely dinner, a bottle of wine to share and enjoy a wondrous evening of food and libation without completely destroying their wallet.",Ryan K.,,,,,,

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,10/25/13,"I made this reservation during a business trip for a group.  We wanted trendy and classy and that's exactly what we got.  The wine list was great, even though the first four bottles I asked for the restaurant was out of.  That was quite disappointing because they didn't note that on the menu, nor did our server mention it before I ordered.  Beyond that, the food was delicious.  The prawn appetizer was quite tasty and served in a lovely red sauce with vegetables.  Everyone ordered something different from the lamb pasta to the veal parmesan and they all were very happy.  I ordered the scallops on the menu and they cut like butter and were cooked to perfection.  Overall a great experience and definitely someplace I would recommend on any future trip to Columbus.  Extremely enjoyable.",Veronica L.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,3/28/15,"We had dinner with four people on Friday night. We had made reservations which I highly encourage for dinner. We were seated but didn't get attention from a server right away. Once I asked, the server came by and apologized profusely. It was genuine and unusual for this type of restaurant. She took our drink orders and moments later an appetizer appeared - on the house - to apologize for the miss. I appreciated the server going above and beyond to make up for the miss. Dinner arrived promptly as well and was very tasty. I was so incredibly impressed at the service relieved despite the initial experience.",Melissa K.,,,,,,

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,4/22/13,"My boyfriend and I took his 9-year-old daughter to Martini for a ""fancy dinner"" treat, as she had requested Italian. We definitely picked the right place.The service was top notch - accommodating for the young lady without babying her. She got a huge Shirley Temple with tons of cherries, but ordered lasagna for dinner off the regular menu. I enjoyed the penne in vodka sauce, boyfriend loved the short ribs. Highly recommend the dark cherry Manhattan. We could've drank 10 of those. The description makes it sound like it'll be too sweet, but it's not. I want to go back just to have another one! On a Saturday night the valet was kind of a mess when we went to leave, so don't be in a hurry to get to your next destination on busy evenings.",Allison C.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,2,2/14/15,"The only reason this restaurant is getting 2 stars is for the outstanding customer service and the awesome drinks. The martini's and pine fin are made perfectly.The food however was so disappointing and lacked taste. The customer service was excellent, you are greeted with a smile and for the most part everyone is very attentive. The food, we started with the beef carpacio-flavorless, dry, and the beef did not seem to be quality at all. The bread that was brought over was ice cold, literally ...it seemed to be taken fresh out of the fridge. Scallops were ok, but not the best I have ever had. The flavor again was lacking.The tenderloin, was again just ok, not the best cut and it was flavorless, the pasta that accompanies it(the 6 pieces of small rigatoni), not even cooked correctly. Waitress was for the most part attentive , but seem to disappear alot. As soon as we told the waitress the food was lacking , the manager came right over to see what she could do to make our meal better, with out us even complaining. Again , customer service great, drinks great, food very disappointing.",Michele G.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,2011/3/13,"We went around dinner time during the week.  The front of the restaurant is buzzing with people near the bar.  The tenderloin was strongly recommended so I tried it.  I am not a big fan of putting cheese on top of my steak.  It was ok and it was cooked right but probably should have tried one of the pasta dishes.  Appetizers (bruschetta, calamari and mozzarella cheese) were good.",tae k.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,1/16/13,"I recently made a ""dinner trip"" up to Columbus for my mother-in-laws birthday. Didn't know what to expect since I did not pick the restaurant. My thoughts are below. Big props for half off wine night on Sundays. Our table had two bottles. Decor and Staff - Both were very wonderful. Our waiter was kind, personable, and more than attentive. Food - We have the calamari and scallops. Both were fantastic. The scallops were cooked perfectly. The hot peppers that can with the calamari were fantastic. Best calamari I've had outside of San Fran. I ordered the Lamb Pappardelle. Pappardelle is my favorite pasta - so I had high expectations. Everything about the dish was delicious. I typically hate mushrooms but actually found myself really enjoying them. I had the Banana Chocolate Bread Pudding for dessert. This was also fantastic. The chocolate came rushing out of the bread once you cut into it. The perfect ending to my meal. I would recommend anyone to stop by this place if you are in Columbus. I will definitely be going back!",Christopher W.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,5/16/15,"I was in town with some colleagues on business and went because another colleague recommended the fresh pulled mozzarella . Overall, I'm glad that we went.  Our server, Justin and the GM, Alex, were very, very attentive and patient with all of our questions. (We are opening a restaurant and had a lot of questions about product, procedures and their operational and menu choices in general.)  In regards to service, by far, they deserve way more than 5 stars. In reality, I should probably deduct a star for some minor critiques but since I was kind of hunting for criticism and the small points based on my own personal preference, five stars is well deserved. I'll still include my comments just for the sake of sharing my experience. In general, the flavors, price, presentation of food and drink was great. The pulled mozzarella was a little overworked and tough, but still enjoyable. The carpaccio was wonderful, but I wished for a little more greens and some acid to elevate the dish- the beef was a little lost. Still, very good, though. The jumbo prawns were enjoyable- I don't think they were a shining star, but I certainly wasn't disappointed. We also ordered the lamb pappardelle which I really liked, but my colleagues were looking for a a little more ""lamb"" flavor. I don't really care for lamb so I found it very good. The sauce on the tortelloni and ravioli didn't have significant differences in their flavor profiles and while a bit heavy, the pasta/filling ratio was spot on and flavors pretty well balanced. I'm in love with the lemon tart. I certainly didn't need dessert, but I couldn't stop eating it!  All in all, it was a great meal and a wonderful experience- I'll surely be back next time I'm in town. Thank you Alex and Justin for making our evening such an enjoyable and informative experience!",Maija T.,,,,,,

My husband and I ordered several items and they split them on two plates each.Our server was both times we have gone have been great - always providing recommendations, quick refills, and keeping us updated on any delays on our order.Cons:Restaurant has a very open floor plan and is LOUD.  Not the best spot if you actually want to talk to your date at less than a yell.Drinks - my husband and I were both disappointed in our cocktails.  My ""the bazzi"" drink had a bitter aftertaste.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2009/7/13,"Absolutely the highlight of our night out, mainly due to Angie (our server), who was extraordinary! Started off with a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon that she suggested and the beef carpaccio and bruschetta apps. We were dinning with friends who were regulars there, so we followed their lead in doing the chefs challenge. The dish I got was a seafood and pasta marriage made in heaven. I was thoroughly amazed at the layers of flavor in the sauce and how perfectly the pasta and seafood was cooked. The sauce was a sweet red sauce that had a very light refreshing finish to perfectly compliment the taste and texture of the scallops and shrimp. I used the complimentary bread (not to mention the pesto that accompanied the read was delicious) to sop up ALL if the remaining sauce and sent the plate back with not a streak of sauce on it. Clean plate club for me :)Amazing night, awesome food and extraordinary service. Will be going back and highly suggesting it to friends and family. Thanks Chef and Angie!",Tony B.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2002/2/13,"This is my favorite restaurant that I've been to in Columbus so far. It is a beautiful restaurant near the Arena District and it is very romantic. My boyfriend and I went here on a date night and had the best time. They have a great wine list and drink list with a little something for everyone. And....THE FOOD. Out of this world delicious. My boyfriend and I both started with the handmade mozzarella cheese. They literally make it right before they bring it to you. It's still warm. It comes tomatoes and pesto and if I remember correctly some bread. It's one of the simplest and most delicious things I've ever eaten. Second course, we both had the veal and spinach ravioli. Best pasta dish we've both ever eaten. I can't even tell you how good this is. The sauce is the most delicious thing ever. When the manager came over to our table, my boyfriend joked to him that he would have liked a spoon so he could drink the sauce...he didn't drink the sauce...don't worry.Third course, my boyfriend had the veal martini and I had the short rib. I had never had short ribs or polenta and this dish made me want to eat both every day for the rest of time. It was amazing. Also, the waitstaff were so, so friendly and as always with me, that goes a long way.If I had more money and lived closer to this place, I'm pretty sure I would weigh 400 pounds because I would want to eat here all the time. Take someone you're trying to impress here.",Emily L.,,,,,,

I wanted to treat my parents out to a nice and delicious meal, but we may not be returning.Food was great - we ordered the mozzarella (fresh with delicious pesto), penne alla vodka, lamb pappardelle (little too salty) and marsala (very well cooked and flavorful). Service was terrible. Our waiter mis-took our order so the wrong dish came out which we received the corrected dish towards the very end of our meal. Then he charged us for the wrong meal that we did not have which I pointed out during the check. Without any apologies, he said that they are all the same price and you can check the menu. Then he came back saying oh nevermind your dish was few bucks cheaper. Needless to say, we were not pleased with such poor service which really ruined our dining experience.",JS K.,,,,,,

I started off with the Modern Martini, dirty of course. Awesome! It came with three (yes, 3!) gorgonzola stuffed olives. My friend ordered the Testarossa which was a fruity martini mixed drink. Had a sip--definintely tasty, although I am not one to enjoy sugary, sweet drinks. Quite a selection of antipasti and salads. I ended up ordering the Panzanella salad which had arugula, garlic croutons, fresh mozz, tomatoes drizzled with balsamic. Incredible! For my main dish, I ordered the Chicken Carbonara. It was okay--nothing special. I snagged a bite of my friends Butternut Squash ravioli. That's where it was at! The service staff was very attentive and willing to answer questions. My other friend couldn't decide between the clams dish and the shrimp radiatorre. The waitress offered to do a half plate of each.

It's definitely a good date spot.I came here for a friend's birthday and there were 8 in our group. We started with drinks in the bar, which were all delicious. They really do know how to make a delicious dirty martini. The specialty cocktails were all really great, too. The bartender was hilarious and played along with our group of ladies who were clearly looking to have a good night.The server was fun, funny, understanding and patient. I'm sure it's difficult to work with 8 tipsy adults, ranging in ages from 22-forties, but he never seemed annoyed by us. Everyone enjoyed their food and the atmosphere was perfect for laughter, drinking, eating and talking.I ordered the linguine with clams. It was tasty...full of clams. Not the best pasta I've ever had, but it definitely hit the spot. The bread alone was amazing and made it worth going there. They brought my friend a free birthday dessert. Some sort of chocolate, peanut butter cake that tasted of heaven and decadence. I wanted 17 more pieces.Maybe not my favorite ""nice"" place in Columbus, but there's not much that Cameron Mitchell forgets about when making a restaurant/ lounge.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,12/16/11,"After the Yelp Masquerade Party, looking our finest and having missed a lot of the cuisine, My lovely date and I weren't ready to call it a night. We were brainstorming about what restaurants were close by where we could walk in, me in a tux, her in a lovely fall number, and not be overdressed. One of us brought up Martini, and neither of us had been in a while, so we decided that was the spot. We had some discussion about whether it was still a Cameron Mitchell establishment or not (it is), and I commented that it had certainly been remodeled since I was last there. Now, I started this review two months ago, so specifics of the menu and entree selections are sketchy at this point, but despite the fact that the food was delicious, that's really neither here nor there because what I really want to talk about is our server. His name was, if I recall, Mike (if it wasn't Mike, it was Matt. I'm 100% sure it was one of those two, 70% of which is on Mike, if you want to request him). Mike delivered some of the best service I have received at any restaurant ever, and most certainly the best service I had in 2011. First of all, he was hilarious. Incredibly so. He had an astounding wit, and his timing was perfect. He only interjected with a quip at exactly the right time. He had a southern accent that might have affected my opinion a bit, but the banter was effortless. It didn't seem concocted or contrived. A really, really enjoyable experience.Beyond that, his recommendations, and we asked for numerous, were spot-fucking-on. We each picked out two dishes we wanted, and asked his opinion on them. High marks on steering us correctly. I don't remember what she had, nor exactly what I had, but I recall that it was a squash-based dish and it was fantastic. I asked for a wine recommendation as well, and it was equally accurate. Our final bill was in the neighborhood of $50, and the dining experience was miles above my recent visit to Rossi, where I dropped $108.I see spotty reviews for Martini, so my advice would be to request Mike. He's worth two stars by himself.",Luke T.,,,,,,

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2011/7/12,"The first time I went I got the filet.  It comes on a small bed of fresh noodly pasta, with a chianti reduction sauce, and some kind of infused butter of some sort on the steak.  It is so goddamn good I don't know what to say.The second time I went I got the filet again.  It's that goddamn good.Third time I got the lamb and spinach ravioli.  Really great.  The pasta has that super-fresh just-made homemade kind of wonderfulness going on.  The ravioli filling is balanced and the sauce is creamy, delicious, and not too heavy.My family and I always share and try a bite of everyone else's dish, so I've tried a lot on the menu.  Everything has been so wonderful.  My least favorite was the lasagna, but that's just me.  I prefer it to be a little more sloppy/saucy.Martini's probably has one of the best salad's I've had: the panzanella.  Holy sh*t.  Homemade croutons that crunch and melt in your mouth at the same time = god.  Roasted tomatoes on the bottom, mixed greens on top, great dressing, not overpowering.  The best.Even their bread is memorable.  Fresh focaccia with a slight hint of sweetness along with the hint of saltiness.

TO DIE FOR.I went there on a Wednesday night around 7:30 PM, so I am not sure what this place is like on the weekends, but the ambience was perfect, and our waitor was very nice and attentive. This could be one of my new favorite spots in Columbus. Who cares if it's pricey because you get what you pay for! Seriously go to Martini ASAP.",Stephanie B.,,,,,,

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2003/10/12,"My wife and I came here for her birthday only because we had a gift card for Cameron Mitchell restaurants and it was priced mid-range.Our experience was pretty fantastic.  Service was great (he was around when we needed him but not bothersome).  We had the butternut squash ravioli, as suggested on here, and the chicken parmesan.  The ravioli was amazing; the chicken was good but nothing exceptional.The only slight disappointment about our experience was the martinis, which is funny considering the name of the restaurant.  My wife had the Yellow Cake Martini, which she enjoyed but it tasted more like a kids drink than an alcoholic one.  And I had the Dark Cherry Manhattan which was way too sweet for a manhattan.  At $12 a pop these should have been better in my opinion.The atmosphere was modern but had a classy feel.  There is no dress code but don't be a bum ... you'll stand out.",Keenan M.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2/20/12,"I stick with my 4 star review. My husband and I came back here for a quick bite and a cocktail while we were back in town for the weekend. We walked in and sat right at the bar and ordered a yellow cake martini (my standby drink choice here) and a vodka tonic for him. Both drinks were delicious as always. We both got a beef carpaccio to curb our hunger since it was still early for dinner but we were starving. My husband claims that Martini's is by far the best beef carpaccio he's ever had and was so happy we could get a plate while we were visiting. I agree. It's thinly sliced, melt in your mouth, amazing with a crispy fried polenta cake on top and a tiny bit of greens and grated parmasean. Order it and enjoy the party in your mouth. I want to give Martini's a 5, but for 2 beef carpaccio appetizers, 1 martini, 1 vodka tonic, and tip - we paid just over $50. That's a bit steep for a quick bite but I don't regret it because I was a very satisfied customer.",Megan D.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,11/22/12,"I've been eyeing Martini since I first moved up here in August. When I finally got the opportunity to eat there, I jumped on it.I was surprised to find that when I went to fill out an online reservation through Yelp for an 8:30pm table, at 5pm, they were booked up and I had to wait till 9:30pm. Which wasn't bad. It was a Saturday night so it was fun to go out late.I dined with a friend who was up for an adventure just as I was. They aren't kidding when they list the dress-code as fancy and dressy. It had an almost club-style clothing feel. Especially with the club-style music, dim lighting and flashy decor.  Which, by the way, was awesome decor. My friend and I loved it. Especially their holiday tree which they had just put up. The red chandeliers were hard to not look at.I had put a note on my Yelp reservation that I'm allergic to shellfish and she to certain nuts. Upon arrival our waitress immediately acknowledged that she had received that note and would be sure our food was allergen-free. I was impressed by this and thankful for it.We took forever to order our food. I spent a lot of time cross-analyzing the menu, guessing at terminology, and explaining what I could figure out to my friend. I was thankful that our waitress was very understanding of our slowness, and it didn't feel at all like she was trying to push us out or hurry us up. She told us three or four times ""Oh it's no problem, take your time."" At first she was as any waitress, checking on us frequently. But soon she realized that we were two snails and she let us take our time.We started with ""Promtini's"" because I'm not 21, and she didn't want to drink. They were super cute, pink, fruity, virgin martinis. Tasty! I like when restaurants offer at least one other option to daiquiris for us underage diners.After much deliberation, we settled on the mozzarella appetizer to start the food. We were mostly curious as to how this ""cooked fresh to order"" thing was going to work. Mozzarella cooked fresh? What?HOLY COW; it was delicious. The mozz was so soft, bouncy, and, surprisingly, sweet! have never had mozz that was sweet. The pesto, you ask? HOLY COW; it was delicious. I have never liked pesto before. But I could not get enough of that pesto. Mix the pesto, mozz, roasted tomatoes onto the crustini into one delicious bite and HOLY COW; explosion of flavor.We spent another 20 minutes or so picking the next course. We settled on the chicken carbonara. We were not sure what the portion size was going to be, so we thought maybe we'd have to get one or two more pasta plates to satisfy our appetites. However, it was a rather large serving and satisfied the both of us. I was impressed with the dish overall. The sauce came to our plate in perfect condition. The pasta was nice and chewy, not that gross slimy stuff that most restaurants serve. It was a bit odd that in contained huge, crunchy asparagus ends. I like asparagus, but the pieces were huge. I did enjoy the slivers of garlic that added little garlic explosions to every bite. The bacon could have been a bit more crunchy, and a little less chewy but it wasn't bad.After the pasta we settled on two separate desserts because she has a nut allergy and I wanted the cake that had nuts. Both desserts were delicious, but I did like hers better. She had the ice-cream style cake with cherry sauce. The sauce really made that dish special.Sometime half-way through dessert I glanced at my phone and realized it was 11:50pm. What a restaurant to keep us entertained for that long with only two plates of food, and two desserts. This is definitely gone on our list of return-to's.",Elizabeth D.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2010/5/15,"I was in Columbus for the first time and we had hair arrived just a few hours prior and dining here couldn't have made a better impression on me.

Vodka martini with gorgonzola stuffed olives-can't go wrong, but the real highlight was the grapefruit gimlet-YUM! So fresh-they go down waaaay to easily. Food wise-I got the veal spinach ravioli in a cream garlic sauce. Oh, heaven. Large slices of shaved garlic melted in my mouth-not great for talking to cute guys at the bar later on, but it was so good I didn't care. Delicious delicious! Then for dessert was the chocolate torte with homemade whip cream-seriously, I want more now! Food spendy? Yeah. But it's so worth it.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,9/17/13,"I ordered Martini's a couple of times while working in Columbus this past summer, and I am still craving their chicken parm. I stayed next door at the hotel where they recommended me to try here. The first time I got the chicken parmesan - it was wonderful. The chicken was cooked perfectly and with a twist - it had the rigatoni over the top of the chicken with sauce and cheese. There was just enough sauce, which was wonderful, and the rigatoni was cooked perfectly. I crave this parm. For desert I tried the tiramisu. The portion was so huge I could not finish it. It was delicious. Creamy and full of flavor. The next time I ordered from here I got the lasagna - which was good, but a little salty for my taste, and the chocolate bread pudding - which was good, but nothing to write home about. The hostess and bartender both gave me a warm greeting each time I went to get take out, and they know how to package to go food - which was great as I needed to work back at my hotel. If I am ever in Columbus again I will make sure to stay next to Martini's so I can order their amazing chicken parm!",Jenna H.,,,,,,

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2/20/09,"Since the dinner was paid for by someone else, I ordered something a little more of modest price off the menu because I didn't want to rack up the bill.   I ordered the chicken marsala which is one of my favorite italian dishes anyway.  The table shared a few appetizers such as the zuppa pomodoro, brick oven pizzetta, and calamari.  The stand out among these appetizers was the pesto in the zuppa pomodoro.  It was so good I would drizzle it on just about anything... hot dogs, bananas, sushi, you name it.  Now I sound like a pregnant woman with food cravings.Anyway, back to the the chicken marsala.  The chicken was nice and crispy with a very light marsala reduction sauce.  I'm more of a fan of braised chicken marsala, but I thought the dish was definitely better than the marsalas from some of the restaurants in Chicago.  Oh, and the creamy mascarpone polenta was just fantastic.  Lastly, I'm sure the classic tiramisu is good here, but order the chocolate banana pudding.  I was already stuffed at this point, but my stomach gladly made another chamber to accommodate this heavenly chocolate drizzled goodness.  Decor and service was great, why the four stars?  I just felt there was room for improvement on the some of the appetizers.  Overall, solid restaurant and another hit on my Cameron Mitchell tour.",Luan N.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,1,2001/9/9,"Wow, what a disappointment!My company Christmas gift was a $100 gc to any Cameron Mitchell restaurant and I decided on Martini as it was close proximity to campus and sounded good...boy was I wrong!Perhaps what led to the unpleasant experience was that I got carry-out.  But I don't really accept that since I think the food and service should be good regardless of where the food is eaten.I ordered a beer at the bar while I was waiting for my food, and ordered the bruschetta and a salmon caesar salad.  Here are the ""highlights"":*Never received my beer.*Never received the opportunity to ask for said beer since I was ignored completely by the four ""busy"" bartenders. (Half the bar was empty.  Sorry, not ok.)*About 2 minutes before my food arrived, I was asked if I'd like something to drink.  Actually, I DID want something, but that was 20 minutes ago.  So no thanks anymore.*I had asked for the olive oil and balsamic that normally comes with the bruschetta to be in included, but in individual containers so the bread wouldn't get soggy by the time I got home.  I was told ""no problem,"" yet received neither.*The bruschetta order (costing maybe $9) consisted of 2 pieces.  At 2 bites apiece, we're talking $2.25 a bite.  Perhaps I don't have an educated palate, but that's what I call a freaking rip-off.*The asparagus on the bruschetta (only ingredients I can discern are asparagus, proscuitto and cheese) was the ends only.  None of the good asparagus tips.  I personally would like to know why I got the shit produce.   Nobody likes the ends!  And at the aforementioned $2.25 a bite, they must be making around a 95% margin on this item.  *The tiny caesar dressing container was about half full (look at me, I'm an optimist!) and was nowhere near enough dressing for the salad.  And I'm one ofthose that uses only a small amount of dressing anyways, so for me to not have enough means the quantity was severely lacking.*The salad itself had a few random pieces of non-romaine in it.  Not a biggie, but it was clear something wasn't right.  There were also maybe 3-4 tiny pieces of what I finally figured out were roasted garlic.  Again, not a big deal, but WTF were they doing in the salad?So...yeah.  Not so pleased.  The only good things that came out of this experience was that I didn't eat a lot so my NY resolution is still on track, and it technically didn't cost me anything.",Kate K.,,,,,,

It was good then, but they have raised their game.  Food was excellent.  Home made pastas were a hit for everyone (Butternut Squash, Veal and Spinach, and Chicken Carbonara all got rave reviews).  My steak was good, but I should have ordered a pasta.  The beet salad and Caesar salad got good reviews as well.  Bread Pudding Dessert and CrÌ¬me Brule were excellent.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,8/15/12,What can be said other than Fantastic!! My wife is Gluten intolerant and has mushroom allergies. Not a problem!

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,2,2007/1/10,"Second chances aren't always redeeming. When my best friend picked Martini for a celebratory dinner, who was I to argue? I hadn't been here in over a year so I bit my tongue and thought maybe, just maybe, they'd improved. A word of advice to potential patrons: Read the menu carefully before you go! If you're vegetarian, they'll have to make something special for you. Every single dish on the menu has either fish or meat. If you're allergic to gluten, you'll either starve or have to do the same. And for safety sake DO NOT order off the gluten free menu! The mozzarella appetizer that's listed there comes with bread on the plate, which is both insulting and dangerous.As a carnivorous gluten-lover myself, I ordered the veal & spinach ravioli. It was decent, but a sad-looking portion for the $18 price tag. There was sauce poured onto half the pasta, but not the other half. I'm not sure if someone forgot to finish plating it or if the point was for me to try the dish both with and without a primary ingredient, but it kinda sucked. I will say that I really enjoyed the mango sorbet served with fresh berries we got for dessert, but certainly not enough to say my experience here has improved any. Sorry, Martini. Still slow, still mediocre, still overpriced. No thanks.",Valissa W.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,2,6/30/10,"For once, I don't have much to say.  The pasta was tasty, though the noodles were far from el dente. Just sayin' that if a place plays itself off as Modern Italian, they can at least cook the noodles right. The drinks were pricey as my Maker's Manhattan cost $9, which if I wanted to spend $9 on bourbon I would have gotten scotch. The atmosphere was pretentious at best and our server had the personality of a goldfish. Beyond all that, I am sure some people would really enjoy the place, its just not for me.1 HUGE problem:      As a bartender and booze connoisseur, the way they serve martinis is utterly ridiculous and counter productive. They bring them out in single drink sized shaker tins, shake them on the spot, and pour them into your glass. The problem with all this is that your drink was prepared by the bartender who sat the drink at the server well to be picked up where it surely sat for 2 minutes before it was carried to your table, then sits while your server places all the drinks and glassware down, then gets shaken and poured.  All the while, your martini, which is shaken to make it super cold without being watered down by melting ice, is wallowing in a bath of ice cubes for 5 minutes or more.  My suggestion, order everything on the rocks because that is essentially what you are getting anyway (or order at the bar so that it goes straight from the bartender to you).",Craig L.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,11/14/12,"I'll second the raves about the cocktails and the butternut squash tortellini!Now I'll explain why I only gave it three stars:  Made reservations for 8:30 on a Saturday night after reading reviews that said this was good for a romantic date night.  Arrived on time for our reservations and still had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  It was also very loud in there.  I'm glad they're doing good business, I'm just basing my review off the expectation that it would have the romantic ambiance we expected.Once I met the friendly and knowledgeable staff, saw the menu, and tasted the food, I understood why they were so busy--everything was fabulous!  The scallop appetizer was to die for!My only other complaint is that I got a bit of a stomachache afterwards because everything was so heavy (ie, buttery!).

I wouldn't come back here for dinner. Maybe on another night I could have had a better experience, but there are too many great restaurants in Columbus and the surrounding areas to worry about giving a place another chance. I didn't recall a lot of choices on the menu. The appetizer we ordered was tasty but tiny. It was a plate of cheeses, olives, and meats. The Chicken Picatta was tasty but tiny.

It would be really nice if fewer restaurants in cool cities like Columbus so aggressively sought to emulate the ""feel,"" ""pizazz,"" and ""atmospherics"" of ""hip"" spots back east.  This sleek hipness should be the object of scorn, not envy.  It's the reason my hometown, Brooklyn, is now largely intolerable.  Martini could have redeemed its consultant-crafted decor with good food.  But it didn't.  The beet salad was fine.

That was just too much food for one person and I ended up bringing half of it home.  But all in all, it was a very nice meal and very good service.",Paul F.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,1/14/10,"Went here for a friends birthday this week, I was kind enough to let her pick the restaurant and she demanded to try Cameron Mitchell's other Italian joint.  We got a large group table by the window where we could watch the passerbys and they could apparently wave at us.  I was amazed at how busy it was for a Tuesday night, I'm glad that we made a reservation or we might not have gotten a table.I started with the mozzarella and a friend had the martini salad.  I should mention that I'm a huge fan of cheese, especially when it is done well.  I love my appetizer and I'm not sure if anyone else managed to get a biteful...  For a meal we tried the chicken marsala, the veal and spinach ravioli, the lamb pappardelle, the milanese, and the gnocchi.  The raviolis were absolutely delicious, I nearly traded my marsala for the dish.  Sad to say that I feel jipped having gotten the chicken marsala.  The chicken itself was a bit overcooked and tough, fortunately the polenta made up for some of the lack of flavor.  Everyone else thoroughly enjoyed their dishes and cleaned their plates.Sadly none of us tried the martinis so I can't report on how they tasted.  But I'd suggest the bread pudding if you're looking for a dessert.  I'd suggest it for a fancy date, not such a great place for a large group outing.",Michelle K.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,11/21/08,"Great new decor!  I went for dinner, and at night the lights are dimmed and the music is turned up a notch.  Patrons and servers are bustling all over the place!Girls beware!: The high polished wood floors are a disaster or embarassment waiting to happen.  The menu, revamped too, it pretty limited on selection.  I was disappointed about that.  For someone who doesn't like to eat pasta or meat, I was stuck with the salads.  Not a bad place to be, the arugula salad with brick oven baked tomatoes and a lemon vinegrette was wonderful!  I also heard rave reviews around the table about the beet salad and the Martini salad (which comes with prosciutto crisps on top).I did want to order the seared ahi tuna entree, but it was $27.  I couldn't swing it!  So I settled on the salad and the Brick Oven Pizzetta.  I don't recommend it.  It comes out looking like a plain, pita bread pizza.  It is sprinkled with Cambozola cheese, which doesn't melt well, and a extra virgin olive oil.  It's also served with an entire half of a roasted garlic.  I'm glad I reserved the rest of my salad dressing and the pesto from the bread dish.  I think if I order it again, I will request a side of marinara or something similar.  If you can request to be seated in Brian's section.  He was our server and although a big group mean a longer meal, he was fabulously attentive and had no problem separating our bill.  He also easily handled a special call in order for a surprise bottle of wine and a to-go meal.  One of our friends popped in just to say happy birthday and pick up his dinner.",Ellen F.,,,,,,

We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by the female bartender (name?) and the male bartender Adam.  We were offered drink suggestions when we asked.  My hubby LOVED the Dark Cherry Manhattan!  Hungry, we asked Adam for food suggestions.  He recommended the Buffalo Mozzarella and the steak and described each beautifully.  We went with the Mozzarella appetizer and the Butternut Squash Tortellini.  OMG!  He was right on!  The Buffalo Mozzarella arrived freshly-pulled, warm and drizzles with evoo and pepper, accompanied my fresh roasted tomatoes, homemade pesto and crostini.  Delish!  The Butternut Squash Tortellini was to-die-for!  Seriously...it was one of the top 5 pasta dishes I have ever had!  This place is visually appealing.  Very modern and beautiful.

The ambiance was cozy and busy/crowded but we could hear each other across the table for two.  Our waiter, Ryan, was very helpful and pleasant but not intrusive.  His suggestions were perfect.  My gluten free bread was delicious and so was the pesto dipping sauce.  My beef carpaccio (sp?) was mouthwateringly tender and the sauce and garnishes perfect.  My guest is a fan of beets so her beet salad drew raves.  We both ordered the seared scallops and they were fresh and tender with a delicious sauce and brussells sprout/escarole garnish.  Dessert was a creme brulee to die for with a couple of cookies that just happened to be my guest's favorites.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,1,12/14/13,"One of the truly, worst meals I've eaten.   I had the shrimp marsala.  It had four or five, tiny, overcooked shrimp.  Most of it was an overly spicy red sauce on pasta--that I didn't bother to finish.  Ragu would be preferrably for flavor.   The black cherry martini was good, but for $12, it should be.  My sisters chicken was awful, and another member of our group said his chicken marsala was 'skimpy'.   Most of the group of six left hungry.   I'll never go back---a big waste of money.  If I want good italian, I'll go to Morretti's.  They know how to make a red sauce.",MJ G.,,,,,,

The value here isn't great either because it is pretty expensive and the portions are the size of a snack or at best a tapas plate.  My scallop appetizer was just that.  A single scallop.  It was quite tasty, but it's hard to tell from .35 oz of it.  This is a place that is good - no question. But I probably won't be back unless I go with a group or another couple.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,8/30/10,"I had a simply delicious meal last night at Martini that couldn't have been presented to me better. The food was superb and worth 5 stars all by itself.My boyfriend's mother came into town last night for his OSU graduation (Master's in Music Ed. What What?!) and wanted take us out to a nice restaurant. We suggested Martini.I had gone here two years ago before they did some renovations, and changed the menu around a little. I had remembered the food being good, but I always like to write a review after it's fresh in my mind. Martini certainly looks elegant; high ceilings, fancy chandeliers, and white leather seats. The restaurant definitely sets the mood for more exquisite dining.We started off with a bottle of wine, a 2008 Sauvignon Blanc considering that we were all having white sauce and for whatever reason were already sick of Pinot Grigio. That was probably the most snobby sentence I've ever written. Don't care, moving on. It was a lovely choice that turned out to compliment the food graciously in the end.As far as salads go, we ordered a Martini Salad (romaine, arugula, pine nuts, gorgonzola, prosciutto, tomatilos, and balsamic) as well as a fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil salad that they had been offering special that day. Both were very good, and you could tell that if the greens or tomatoes had been any fresher, they would have still had dirt on them. The waitress had told us that the tomatoes had just come in and were from a local farm. Also, the Martini Salad had some cucumbers on the bottom! They were delicious, but weren't featured in the menu or in the salad. Next time, put them front and center.The appetizers came next: Fried calamari with a wonderful Worcester/ mayo/ mustard sauce. My boyfriend's mother said that it was the best version of that dish that she's ever had. We also got the brushcetta with the prosciutto on it. I wasn't as nuts about this one. It was good, but I thought the use of the prosciutto (while cut absolutely PERFECTLY thin, likes it's supposed to be) was to weird for me. I think its just my own person taste on this one.Entree: I got the pennette alla vodka. Simple, I know, but it was exceptional. It was made with prosciutto and mushrooms (which I also wish had been featured more) and a very light creamy sauce. The sauce was full of flavor but not too thick - it was absolutely perfect. The rest of my party got fettuccine and clams, lamb pappardelle, and the gnocchi bolognese. There was absolutely no complaints, just contented sighs and smiles.I was going to dock one star due to the service, but then decided against it. The waitress was not bad. She was even what I consider ""above average"". However, she made a few off-handed comments that rubbed me the wrong way. One of them was ""Only two salads?"" after eyeing all four of us. Another was a comment to me about my pasta ""No protein with that? Shrimp, chicken, beef?"" Uh no, If I had wanted one I would have asked for one. Thanks. And lastly ""Wow, all pastas at this table. Are you all sure no protein?"" My friend joked and said that it was because we all wanted to go to sleep that night. I get it, she's probably a nutrition major or something, but please don't judge our food choices considering that we're paying you a pretty penny to eat here. On paper, it sounded like what she said was innocent enough - but it was the way she said it, sort of condescendingly. But she was excellent with the water, wine and table service although. No thumbs on the plates!All in all, an exceptional meal with exceptional company.",Rachel P.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2008/9/11,"The food was tasty. The ""decor"" was fun to look at.But what really made this experience good was the service. Our waitress was just a doll and really made us all feel at home!",H B.,,,,,,

This place married my favorite things perfectly with a touch of good quality service. Now our appetizer was calamari and although I love the dish, I have never come across a kind of calamari that tops all others. Calamari is calamari, it was good but not something that I would gush about. The entrees were different however. I got the Veal wrapped in prosciutto, and my boyfriend got the ahi tuna. BOTH were absolutely amazing. The veal was tender, and the prosciutto wrapped around was simply orgasmic with the sauce. The ahi tuna was also tender and the potatoes on the side just melted in my mouth. Just remembering the dishes makes me CRAVE it. Great food, Delicious Wine, Amazing Company are what allows me to rate this place a all 5 stars ;) I hope they open a store in Chicago ;)",Yumi Y.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,10/26/12,"Happened to be in Columbus recently on business.  Stayed in the area of the Nationwide Tower and found Martini's on Yelp.  Restaurant is very modern in decor.  Lots of wood contrasted by white laminate.  Bar takes up the front of the restaurant.  Open kitchen so be careful.  Can be noisy and odoriferous.!  Was seated in the back.  Menu is ""Neo-Italian"" with many of the old standard re-packaged with new names.  Case in point..  Veal Milanese..  Well, it's not ""Milanese"" in the traditional style.  It's really Veal Parmesan..  Now it's pretty good rendition mind you although the veal is a bit thin.  Chicken Picatta wasn't..  It was, however, a nice piece of very good chicken atop a bed of polenta.  Odd but, still good.  Butternut squash ravioli were wonderful as well although the pasta was a bit thick.  The pasta itself is wonderful.  House made daily and very well done.  Deserts are not bad.  If you have the yearn go for the Lemon Tart..  More like a mini lemon meringue pie.  Was outstanding.   Wine list is somewhat short but offers a wide variety at a reasonable price.  Wait staff can be a bit too ""zealous"" sometimes and a bit over-friendly.  Wanting to hang around and ""chat"" a bit too much.  Noise can be an issue..  This place can get very loud.  Be forewarned.!!  Prices are likely a bit high for Columbus but still fair.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,2,2/18/09,"Went to Martini's as part of a largish group (8 people).  The service was simply okay, one of our orders was incorrectly taken even though everyone agreed it had been given correctly to the server. To their credit the error was corrected in a timely manner.  First I must say that others at the table seemed to enjoy their food much more than myself. I found the food to be simply average and nothing too interesting.  The spinach and veal ravioli with truffles tasted almost nothing of truffles and had a sauce which overpowered the veal. Their soup was basically what I would get from Trader Joes but cost significantly more. The pizzetta was large and tasted delightful but required far too much assembly at the table. The strongly flavored cheese was placed on a single piece of the pizzetta and the roasted garlic was still in its husks, making it not very easy to share at a large professional gathering.  My strongest complaint was that there were NO entrees nor small plates for vegetarians.  At a steak house I can understand this but since they are an ""Italian Bistro"" they should provide some simple pastas and entrees which are vegetarian friendly.  Their salads are not large enough to consider a meal.",Brian B.,,,,,,

What a beautifully refurbished modern restaurant. And, the food and service were equally impressive! While the bill was not inexpensive; it was commensurate with the each and every item served.

Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,8/27/08,"All I can comment on is the food.  I occasionally go here to eat or start an evening, but being single I simply eat at the bar.  So I have no input on the service.  And it's pretty hard to screw up a vodka and tonic (except for making it too weak), so I won't waste your time commenting on cute drinks that I have never bothered with.  To twist a phrase from Mae West: when it's bad, it's okay, and when it's good, it's really good.  I'll agree with others that the food is hit or miss.  My latest bad meal?  The special - scallops and shrimp on risotto.  The scallops were really nicely done.  The shrimp was just plain ol' shrimp.  The risotto was glued together in a tomato sauce that just didn't work with the other main ingredients.  My latest great meal?  When they get the chicken breasts on linguine with capers and wine sauce right it's worth whatever you pay for it.  So why do I keep going back?  Because the highs of getting it right are higher than the lows of getting it wrong are low.Plus, it's a great location to start the evening.",Steve W.,,,,,,

Two of us went for dinner and drinks on a clear cool Wednesday night.  We were greeted by very friendly hosting staff who were in the midst of a busy shift.  As it's a few minutes till our table is ready, we take to the bar.  These are no simple bar tenders, they are crafters of fine cocktails.  If you want a place that'll just sling you a cheap beer, move on.  If you want a place that will take the time to make you a martini just how YOU like it, pull up a chair.  The bar is complete with a cutting board, numerous garnishes, individual instruments for squeezing each different type of citrus and an assortment of muddling dishes.  Don't get me wrong, these guys aren't slow at all.  But it will take an extra minute to make a Sapphire & Tarragon Pomegranate house special martini or that perfect extra dry Sapphire Martini shaken until frothy cold in a frosted glass.  There are a couple of flat screens behind the bar to watch, however they are hidden from view of tables as to not detract from the decor and ambiance of the restaurant.For dinner, we are seated in a back room that has an array of ambient lighting on each wall.  The columns are painted in a deep shade of red, but with an almost neon red light illuminating them.... ok, enough about the surroundings, let's talk food!!  As is standard at this level of restaurant, we are greeted with fresh bread, olive oil and pesto.  Can I say this is about the BEST pesto that I've ever had?!?!  Yeah, it was!  The service was very friendly and prompt, I won't call it blazing fast but it seemed to match with the feel of the restaurant as they aren't a turn and burn kind of place.  They are happy to have you sit back and enjoy some conversation which isn't drowned out by the ambient music (Think Zero 7 & Thievery Corporation).  I had a Martini Side Salad and the Beef tenderloin which was prepared perfectly in a light, not over powering glaze sitting atop a bed of 8 or so large penne noodles.  I thought this was a particularly nice touch since the meal tasted so great, I couldn't help myself but clean my plate.  This keeps people like me for being soooo stuffed, I can't even move!!  Unfortunately, I didn't have time this evening to try out their desert tray, but I have no doubts that it would have been very very impressive!Ok, the burning question... why 5 stars you ask?  The taste & quality of the food, the staff, & the ambiance of the restaurant.  I would like to go 4.5 stars, but since that's not an option, Martini's... you get the full 5!!  Anyone passing through Columbus, I highly encourage you to swing by and check them out for a couple drinks and a nice dinner with a friend/date or with several friends.  I was told by the bartender that they recently redid the entire place - so, If you haven't been in a while, give it another shot!",KP M.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,3,11/26/08,"Walk in then you think you are on the east or west coast not Columbus OH.  I was impressed by the wine display, bar was right when you walked in and the over feel of the restaurant was ""low voltage electric"".  Meaning it was trying to be chic but not overboard.  One thing I thought was unusual was the old school chandeliers had some glass around it, I would have replaced.  Service was attentive, except she gave too much of her favorites, location was right off the bar (not good for a business dinner).  The food, the Osso Bucco was average and was not shank it was the short rib, polenta was average, so I guess the entre was average.  But I did start with the Tuna salad with white beans and greens, I thought that was good, good grade tuna and beans with raw tuna that was a combination!",Toby N.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,4,2011/12/8,"I just returned from a soirÌ©e at Martini. It was my first time there since they opened with the new concept. It's COMPLETELY different from what it once was.I went for lunch before. I sat in the front where everything was bright and white with green accents. I had the gnocchi and swapped the tomatoes for asparagus. I finished the meal with some very tasty ice cream. Overall, it was fantastic. I didn't understand why they would want to changed it.But when I walked in tonight, I understood. They totally blew the top off of the previous place. The new dÌ©cor is deep and dark with burgundy accents. There are swank chandeliers and huge glass vases everywhere. I was ushered to the back for a private gathering. We were very well taken care of. We had fabulous hors d'oeuvres. There were mixed berries with the best goat cheese I've ever had. There were assorted olives (pitted - blech!) There was a rather bold mozzarella. There was a light and crunchy pizza that I thought was just okay. There were tiny chocolate cakes with raspberries - yum. And, the best of all, there was amazing, amazing, amazing calamari. If you've only had calamari at Olive Garden, shame on you. Branch out, and start your quest at Martini. The calamari was light and crispy, it was accompanied by lightly bread asparagus, greens, and breaded lemon slices. There were so many different flavors including a surprisingly good vinegar. Each bite was self-contained but complimented the bite before and the bite after. I'm almost salivating at the thought of that calamari.I also had a great drink. The drinks at Martini are expensive, about $9 a pop. But if you go during happy hour, you can get them for $3. I had the Apricot Sage Martini (Woodford Reserve Bourbon, apricot nectar, hand squeezed lemon, and house-made sage syrup). The bourbon was strong in the sense that it hit me quickly after drinking it, but the flavor didn't overwhelm the drink in any capacity. I also had a sip of the Pear Elderflower Martini (Absolut Pear Vodka, St Germain Elderflower liqueur, and fresh lemon); If vodka and I were better friends, this would have been my drink of choice. It was succulently sweet and unlike anything I had ever tasted before.I've also had Martini food at catered events. In early October, I wrapped my teeth around their Osso Bucco with root vegetables. It was like butter. I could really taste the burgundy wine too.Be prepared, there aren't any vegetarian options when it comes to main courses.Also, they're no longer open for lunch.Martini was packed to the brim when I went at 5:30p. They obviously know what they're doing.",Morgan D.,,,,,,
Martini Modern Italian,284,4,5,2007/12/9,Great service from Keith.  My wife and I split the mozerella appetizer and the bread salad. I had the filet which was probably the most tender piece of meat I have ever had. Paired it with BonAnno cab from Napa. Excellent meal and super service! Will definitely return and recommend.,Jason S.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2001/2/18,"Seafood schmefood- get the steak. The Bluepoint oysters on the shell were some of the freshest and best I'd had in a long time. The shells were gargantuan. The Shrimp appetizer was also great. Of course they are jumbo (3 bites each) shrimp. You get 4. I had a steak recently at 'The Avenue'; but the 16oz ribeye here was better. Who would have thought ! It had a great sear and was cooked perfectly. Creamed spinach was on point as was the mac and cheese. I would pass on the lobster mashed potatoes. The starch in the creamy potatoes totally washes out the flavor of the shrimp and you just get the chewy nature of the shrimp flesh combined with the potatoes. No one flavor stood out. Nothing wrong with this side, but id save the $20 and get a different side. Very surprised by the bottle of 'whitehall lane' red wine. Very silky and smooth for such a green wine. Also the server staff did a phenomenal job. It was New Years Eve and they were very prepared. Obviously all hands on deck and it went well. They even provided noise makers and party favors and champagne !",Michael H.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,11/30/17,"This is fine dining defined in C'bus. Its got to be a million dollar decoration inside. Large full service classy bar, and an outdoor patio overlooking the heart of Easton.Service is the best in the city, its almost like you having your own waitstaff.All dishes are simply awesome, and chef prepared perfectly.Parking can be an issue. There is an adjacent free garage, but it a little walk, and I recommend reservations.My only nit is portion size. For these prices, I would expected more, but again, what was there was outstanding.And one of the most pricey places in C'bus too...2 apps, 2 entrees, and 4 drinks was a whooping $240. Enough to make it a 'special occasion' only kind of place.Oh, and get the oyster Rockefeller, its better than high end restaurants in NOLA!",Christopher G.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,11/17/17,"Service was awkward. Never in my life have I been helped by three separate waiters. The one who kept coming to our table was a kind woman, made a few jokes, told us the special and was generally very fluent about the menu. I would like to say, though, that I felt uncomfortable about more than two waiters floating around my table bringing as well as taking. The head of house came over to check on us and not a second later our ""main waitress"" as I decided to call her, came to us to also check to see how we were doing. Awkward. Very Awkward. The dÌ©cor was nice, you could see the kitchen staff working and a wine rack at the bar. Good view of Easton, if you were sat at the window. The restaurant was fairly easy to get to, though I imagine on a busy day, would be a somewhat difficult trek.The food was excellent. Crab legs were outrageously expensive, yet they were delicious. I did note some pieces had some graininess to them. The legs were cracked in half on my plate, so I imagine tiny bits of crab shell got into my food. I also noticed a few dirt spots on the underside of the meat. The lemon wedge and the liquid butter, as you can imagine, worked very well with the simple dish. I appreciated the real butter and that I didn't have to crack the crab legs myself. Even though I enjoyed the crab legs, which were cooked well and I had an easy time removing the meat, I would never want to pay $65 just for crab legs again unless they were the only purveyor in town. Joe's Crab Shack is right across the street, I may give them a try sometime.The lobster mashed potatoes were the best side I've ever eaten. Lobster was fresh, cooked wonderfully and sang alongside the buttered and salted mash, garnished with a sprinkle of chives. Excuse me if this is the norm, but I'm not used to going to a restaurant and my mash isn't all old and dry or drowning in garnish. It even had a sauce, or oil, I couldn't exactly tell, but when it seemed like the mash was getting dry, I would mix in the strange liquid and all was well. Never had a lobster mash like that. I WILL come back for that, though I think this time I'll be getting a different main course.The main waitress suggested three beverages on the alcohol list when I asked if they had anything sweet and strong. One of the items stood out to me, the ""Black Orchid."" It comes in a martini glass with a ball of ice in the middle. This ball of ice holds orchid petals inside of it, formed to resemble a flower. I was astonished, wonderfully so. I'm new to the beverages scene as I still prefer soda, but I know what I want in a drink and I'm a fan of Honey Jack. The Black Orchid was a beautiful mixture of berry and citrus flavors. It was smooth and the taste was very addictive, I highly recommend this to anyone who craves a good sweet cocktail with a flare.My overall experience wasn't stunning, but it was high above average. The service, albeit awkward, was wonderful. My family and I were treated well, the food was absolutely amazing, and the restaurant was nice to look at. My family had the steaks, and even though I'm not a steak person, I felt the need to try it at least once on one of my next visits.Seriously though, leave me alone so I can enjoy my food! You don't need to keep checking on us every five minutes, you weirdos! XD",Andrew N.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2011/11/17,"We were a group of 20 and had a great time at this restaurant.  They are conveniently located in the Easton mall.Drinks : They have a whole range of options from wine, beer and cocktails.  We ordered a few new wines to try and they turned out to be great.Food : From appetizers to entrees, we tried practically almost everything on their menu because it was a large group.  The food was exquisite.  I ordered the steak for my entree and it ranks on my Top 3 steaks in the country.  Loved the ageing, flavor and it was cooked to medium rare perfection.  All the sides were tasty and we had a lot of food on the table.Service : Par superior!  We had 3 gentlemen waiting and they were super efficient.  The main wait staff was very observant to the needs of the different guests at the table.  Rate the service a 5/5.Ambience : A classy restaurant with a touch of perfection.  They also have a private room for hosting events.  Paid parking spots are available in the mall or you can use the valet.Price : Expensive but you pay for the exquisite food and amazing service.  Totally worth it!Will I return?:  100% yes!!!",Arun P.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,7/17/17,"I'm really indifferent now about Ocean Club, this based upon the last few visits.  Prices have steadily increased over the years as portions, food quality, and service have all diminished.Eating here used to be an event.  The food was always fantastic, and the service couldn't be matched.  However, there are better places for far less money.  This from someone who has eaten here 50+ times in the past decade.Last night here is what I had:*1/2 wedge salad.  The bacon was nice and crisp, but the dressing was not the normal ""cabernet buttermilk"" dressing, but some generic creamy white dressing that resembled ranch.  I also believe the cheese was not blue cheese, but feta.  Flavorless.*Truffle mac and cheese.  Very very light hint of truffles, more of an afterthought.  Had already started to harden/congeal when it came out.  Heavy velveeta/artificial flavor.  Pasta over cooked.  Salty.  Tiny portion.  It was okay, if $5, but it was three times that.*Jalapeno potatoes au gratin--nice jalapeÌ±o flavor, but extremely small portion for the price.  Unbelievably salty.*Someone at the table also ordered the $12 baked potato........was a big potato but one would expect some kind of wow factor for $12.  Nothing special about this but the size.*Sea bass.  I got it asian style with teriyaki/soy sauce over rice.  The fish was excellent, no complaints on the taste or presentation.  But, extremely small cut of fish for $44.00.  It was more like a small plate in a multi course dinner.*Dining companions both got 6oz filets.....smallest steaks i've ever seen served anywhere.  And for more than $6/oz, it better be the absolute center cut.*Had a ""club manhattan"" cocktail, was good.All in all, for the price, OC isn't worth it anymore.  The sides used to be enough for sharing, but are now individual sides, with higher prices, and not as good.  Food is now very salt heavy, which tends to disguise poor quality.  Some of my old favorites are now not recognizable.  Portions are insultingly small.  Service is no longer the professional endeavor by the staff it once was.",Jared E.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2010/6/17,"I've been a longtime fan of Mitchell's Ocean Club. The food and service is always outstanding.Our little one loves this place, and requests to dine here every year on her birthday. We also love to come for a special dinner with friends.Happy Hour:Lots of seating - a large bar area + lots of high tops. There are lots of delicious choices on the menu and most options are only $6. The HH sushi rolls are $10 and the drink list varies from $4-7. Definitely get the Black Orchid martini - it's excellent and beautifully presented.We love the ahi tuna tacos and the lobster fritters!Dinner:Their portions are quite generous, and my husband and I often share an entree so we can also sample some appetizers, sides, and dessert.Our faves include the truffle mac & cheese, jalepeno au gratin, and the latkes! Here's a tip, the latkes have come off the menu officially, but every time we ask, they ALWAYS make them for us. SO DELICIOUS!Also, our favorite dessert EVER is the Baked Alaska. We just realized that they no longer have it on the menu, but our server mentioned that if you call in advance, they might be able to still make it for you. I'll have to call next time and see if it's true!YUM",Malini S.,,,,,,

They really do go out of their way to accommodate you and the atmosphere is truly delightful especially during the holidays with all the beautiful lights up. If you have a special event Katherine Domnici is incredibly gracious and she'll make sure your event is perfect. The wine list is great and has lots of variety.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2/19/17,"Absolutely phenomenal, 5-star experience - perfect from start to finish!If you are a seafood lover, this is your spot. If you really want to impress that special someone, celebrate an occasion appropriately, or simply take good care of yourself, THIS IS YOUR SPOT. Mitchell's Ocean Club is impressive from the moment you climb the staircase to the entrance and walk in - you're greeted by its sleek, elegant, and classy interior. I might also add that the restaurant is circular shaped, which for some reason I always fancy.The service is exactly what you'd expect. Our waiter, Chip, was very friendly, helpful, and attentive. I ordered two different cocktails (yes, I love my fancy fruity drinks!) - I started off with a Passion Martini, and I'll say that the presentation is enough reason to order it, as the drink literally bubbles and smokes during AND after it's poured! This one was delicious but definitely more on the tart side, so avoid if you prefer sweeter drinks. I later ordered the Black Orchid...oh man. This truly lived up to the Yelp hype and has now become THE best cocktail I've ever tasted. Words can't do it justice, so I'll leave it at that and hope that you do yourself a favor and order it the next time you're in Columbus.Onto the food - we ordered the calamari appetizer, which was phenomenal - subtly crisp skin engulfing a perfectly cooked center (not too chewy, like a lot of other restaurants) and coated in just the right amount of zesty Asian sauce. For my entree, I ordered the famous Chilean Sea Bass, and I will thank myself for years to come for making such a decision. This fish melted on my tongue and could not have been cooked better. I don't know if I'll ever look at any other fish the same way, after having been spoiled by this incredible dish.If you're looking for perfect ambiance, great service, delectable cocktails, and mind-blowing seafood, you'll put your phone/computer down and make a reservation at Mitchell's ASAP. Well...what are you doing still reading my review?!",Christina H.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2001/3/18,"I lived in Tokyo for over five years (fresh seafood galore) and I've got to say that this place has the best seafood I've had in awhile. I went here for New Year's Eve and it was just delightful. I had the lobster pair with asparagus. The lobster was cooked perfectly, best I've had in a long time!! We ordered a bunch of sides and they were each very good. Oysters were wonderful and the shrimp cocktail had a fun presentation. Still having cravings!",Elizabeth S.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,6/14/17,"You can't go to a Cameron Mitchell restaurant and think anything bad the 3 money bar of Yelp is dead on how much you will pay for that dish at one of those restaurants. I've almost always had a pleasant experience at all the Cameron Mitchell restaurant's I've dined at in Columbus.What makes the Ocean Club so good is the seafood is very fresh. For instance the Alaskan Halibut that my husband and I ordered tonight is the freshest fish they have in right now. You can taste the freshness as you take that first bite. The sauce is just an extra to the flavor but the freshness is what really counts when ordering any type of seafood in my opinion. The Alaskan Halibut had lobster ravioli and asparagus and was so good!My husband also ordered the lobster bisque and said it's one of the best lobster bisque he's ever had in his life. It was so creamy and he could taste the lobster inside. I got the house salad and it was pleasant as well. It had your greens, granny smith apples, walnuts and honey dijon dressing. Great for a light crisp summer salad!Also eating outside is a little more quite if you want that intimate setting for dinner. I have been in both the indoor and outdoor and felt the outdoor was a better experience. The waiter's are more personable and you can enjoy the nice upper deck view of Easton. Not to mention listening to a concert playing tonight was a bonus during our dinner! I'll definitely be back to Ocean Club soon for a nice occasion!",Tammy A.,,,,,,

I don't even like fish, but I know I can always get a good steak while my wife enjoys whatever oceanic treasure she feels like. The only downside for us is that the restaurant is horribly loud. Our latest meal was on a weekday evening. We sat on the heated terrace (which was supposed to be the quiet area) and could barely hold a conversation despite sitting right next to one another. We'll probably go back again when the mood hits, but for the money we would much rather eat at the Refectory where we can enjoy both the food and the atmosphere equally.",Corey S.,,,,,,

Made a reservation about 45 mins ahead of time and were seated soon after we arrived. Service was top notch. Server made great recommendations. I ordered a lobster bisque and the surf and turf app (two large scallops and some brisket atop mashed potatoes). Both were very good though the brisket in the app was a little too salty than I would have liked. Nonetheless, as far as seafood served in the Midwest goes, both the lobster and the scallops were succulent. Flavors in both dishes were delicious. My dining companion ordered an 8oz. steak with a side corn dish recommended by our server. The beef was a good meat choice and cooked to request. The corn? As simple as the dish sounds, it might have just been the highlight of our meal! Great food an great service merit the four stars. I have to take one star off for the decor (was a little unimpressive given the status of the eatery) and the prices (the ingresients were good quality and flavors there, but still didn't justify the prices). All in all glad we tried it.",Joanne N.,,,,,,

I don't understand the hype and I really don't understand the lack of attentiveness. THIS PLACE IS LITERALLY ""OK"". It's worth a try at least once, but would I come here again? probably not. The service was polite but it was far from attentive. It took about 30-45 minutes for someone to take your drink order, for someone to bring you bread, for someone to take your actual order etc. ( I completely understand if it takes that long for food to be prepared, but for everything else, that's unacceptable in my book). For what we paid, I've tasted better. The food was average. It was nothing amazing. I eat a lot of fish and seafood because I was raised in Louisiana and I live in Southern California. And from all the restaurants I've eaten at, it's always a hit or miss (mostly miss) with these Cameron Mitchell Restaurants. This place literally has the rep of being the best in Columbus, but quite frankly it's not. The ambience was nice. The crowd was a lively mix of young and old. My favorite part was the dessert.

We had a good solid two months to look forward to celebrating marriage and a night with no kids.  When you are dropping over $150 on a meal alone-- the restaurant needs to either nail the meal or the atmosphere-- and Mitchell's Ocean Club did neither.When arrived, the hostesses took us to the smallest table-- I ""hand measured"" and guesstimate it was around 25 inches long.  I am a size 2 petite woman and this table was WAY too small for even me.  I couldn't even put my wine glass to the right of my plate because there wasn't enough room.  The awkward, cramped table totally killed the ambiance of the restaurant and made it difficult to enjoy our meal and conversation. I ordered the prime rib with a blue cheese crust-- and it truly was divine.  However, the sides at $10-14 each were so mediocre. The asparagus was cooked fine-- but we were expecting more culinary creativity.  They tasted like plain asparagus you would find at Cheesecake Factory.  Our cheese fondue appetizer was also a let down.  The accompanying dipping items could be upgraded-- it seems simple at its price point. The only silver lining to the experience was that our server was professional and attentive,Bottom line:  Huge disappointment.  If you are looking for a fine dining place in the Easton area, you can definitely do better.  J Alexander's is a high end chain that has a similar menu and in my opinion is much better.",Sarah J.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,9/21/16,"The wife and I decided to treat ourselves for our 18th anniversary. We chose the ocean club on a sunday night and was able to get a table on the balcony overlooking to the easton streets. The weather and the time of day was perfect. We had a great view of the sunset.Our waiter was Bradley and he was outstanding. He was polite and extremely helpful for our first time visit. We both ordered the Surf and turf sunday special. 8oz filet for both. She chose the crab cake and I chose the scallops.We both ordered our steaks medium. Hers came out perfect, plenty of pink and extremely tender. Mine not so much. Although it was still good, it was fully brown with no pink at all. And a touch on the dry side. Her crab cake was huge. She liked the flavor of it. My scallops were perfect. Juicy and tender.We finished up with a 10 layer carrot cake. I am not a dessert person, but this thing was amazing. I highly suggest trying it.It was a lovely meal that complimented our anniversary perfectly.",Tom C.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,5/24/17,"We had a late reservation on Monday..it was our anniversary... We sat in a huge booth for a more intimate setting.. The ambiance was on point and so was the food.  I think they have updated their menu since our last visit.  My husband ordered the surf & turf...a filet and lobster tail with asparagus and mashed potatoes. I had the alaskan halibut with a corn & asparagus mixture along with lobster ravioli and a great bottle of red wine.  They even bought us dessert for our anniversary. We selected the warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream and fruit. It was so moist and delicious! Our server, Charlie, was so attentive and very helpful when selecting our bottle of wine. Thanks Charlie!",Shawnda P.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,12/30/15,"This is one of the best fish places in town. It's located in Easton, and has great ambience. A big negative however is that inside it is VERY LOUD. They seriously need to consider putting some insulators to dampen the noise. The last few times it has been difficult to have a conversation even when the restaurant is not that busy. Outside seating in the summer is great though. I've tried a variety of different fish dishes here and never been disappointed. I used to order the Chilean sea bass before it got put on the endangered list :(. But you really can't go wrong if you are a fan of fresh fish. The lobster bisque is excellent, as are their crab cakes. The blackened snapper and the Yellowfish tuna are delicious as well. I would give it five stars if not for the sound issue.",Ness S.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2009/11/16,"The food was absolutely amazing, I tried the Chilean Sea Bass and it literally melted in my mouth. My boyfriend had the surf and turf which he loved too.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,5/14/17,"The ambiance of Ocean Club is nothing short of sheer brilliance. The luxury feel in conjunction with some of the best bartenders Columbus has to offer draw you in and make you want to stay by not only their skill level, but their magnetic personalities.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2009/2/17,It was a fantastic dinner and the service was great. My uncle and I both ordered the surf and turf. My husband got the twin lobster tails as well. The atmosphere was just perfect. We have a wonderful dinner! Thank you!,Jenny K.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,10/21/15,"""Are you celebrating anything?"", they ask.  No, just enjoying great food on a Tuesday.  My husband and I wanted to be pampered and have a good night out without our munchkin. This is definitely the place to do that.  From the beautiful ambiance and great service.  We started off with a few hand crafted cocktails and the calamari.  We kept with the seafood theme and ordered the twin lobster tails and the crabcakes.  We didn't order extra sides knowing the food portions are small but very flavorful and appetizing. We eat with or eyes as much as our taste buds and Cameron Mitchells never fails on presentation.  We actually split our meals and left the right amount of full.  Not the full you want to go home and lay down full but the full that you are satisfied and could go out afterwards.  This is our top dining choice in Columbus for a more up scale dining experience.  We will be back soon for sure.",Mary B.,,,,,,

We had drinks and a salad and then the power went out and then the fire alarms went off. I felt so bad for everyone. The manager the servers were great.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,3/18/17,"Service that hasn't let me down yet. We had a larger group of 12 and were well taken care of. We ordered the large seafood tower which has oysters, crab meat, shrimp that the group can share. For my entree I ordered a bone in ribeye which was dry aged and 1200 degree seared, and dded a lobster topping to it which was really delicious. All sides are family style, highly recommend the Brussels sprouts and Au grautin potatoes. We had a more private side room which allowed for much quieter conversation than out in the open in a busy restaurant. If you want an inexpensive meal this is not the place, but you shouldn't be here unless you want a special meal and service that comes with it. Great date, special event, or business meeting place is you want to have an enjoyable night out and great food you can consistently count on.",Jamin F.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,6/21/16,"It was rather late at night when we arrived at Mitchell's ... it was 9:30 pm, and they closed at 10:00. To be honest, we nearly didn't go because I have been to restaurants that close their kitchen 30 minutes before closing to permit their staff to leave as close to closing time as possible. I consider this practice to be a bit unfair, but I also completely understand it. I would pretty much hate it if a large party came in just before closing and ordered everything on the menu if I were in the kitchen. But we did. The feel:Mitchell's Ocean club is an upscale seafood and steak place with a solid menu that contains some real surprises. It is in the midst of a shopping and dining district, and was actually a bit hard to find after our phone said ""You have arrived at your destination"" ... but we hadn't really. We were able to park on the street due to the late hour, but there appears to be quite a bit of parking anyway. The inside restaurant is surprisingly modern dÌ©cor, but we opted to dine outside as it was a nice clear night. There was another couple nearby celebrating a birthday ... it is that kind of place. Special occasions, memorable first dates, or just (as in our case) a cool night out with someone you care to enjoy a wonderful meal with). The menu:I always love it when I see a menu and I sigh because I cannot possibly eat one of everything that I see. There were a number of apps I would have loved to have ordered -- including one of my favorites Oysters Rockefeller, or the Oysters on the half Shell, or the Truffle Mac and Cheese, or the Lobster Bisque, or ... well you get the idea. I almost locked up. Then I saw they had Sushi .... Sushi Sushi Sushi ..... SUSHI. SO I got the Dragon Shrimp Roll. It was heaven. MMMMM. It was a generous portion of eight rolls. There was sliced Ginger and Wasabi on the corner, but while I did grab a bit of Ginger, I didn't need any Wasabi because the rolls were already an explosion of taste sensation. Luckily:My date ordered fondue. It was a four cheese mixture with beer and came with bread tips, veggies, and surprisingly enough an awesome salami. That's right salami. I would never have imagined such a thing. It was decadent. The Main:So I ended up ordering a Yellow Fin Tuna. it was thick, and prepared exactly the way I like it - rare. It was nearly, although not quite, tender enough to cut with my fork. I mean, I probably could have done so, but that would have been a bit rude. But it sliced easily and cleanly with the knife. The toping: various spices, greens, a couple of small potato's, beans, and mushrooms was not really up to the fine piece of meat. I would have preferred something a bit more tangy like a Mango Relish. That, in my mind, would have been perfect. Also good would have been something more spicy or even a Cajun spice. As it was it was good, but not quite striking. My date had a Steak and a baked potato. Both were excellent. As an aside, there was some left over fondue and we kept it around for the potato. It was a good decision. Our Server:Our server was Lisa, and she did a perfect job. She was not rushed, and did not rush us during our meal. She said that the restaurant believes if you arrive at 10:00 pm ... at closing, you deserve a meal and they will serve you. And, if our experience is any guide, they will ensure you have one of the best meals you have ever had. This was a real treat, in a memorable location. We will treasure the experience.",Ed W.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,6/19/15,"I went to Ocean Club for my birthday, and it really lived up to my expectations. I'd read some past reviews saying that it had the best steaks of all the Mitchell's restaurants, so I knew I had to give them a try. We were there on a Thursday night and got a great seat on the balcony overlooking all of Easton (As great a view as that can be). The service, and our server in particular, was fantastic. He was not only knowledgeable (which you expect from any CMR restaurant) but also incredibly funny and witty. Loved it.My girlfriend had the Black Orchid cocktail, which she absolutely loved, and we started off with the sweet chili calamari appetizer. I'd say of all of the dishes we had, this was probably my least favorite, only because I've had it so many other times before around town. I'm pretty sure Spagio had the exact same dish the last time I went there, and although it's good, it was a bit boring.For the main dishes, I had the ribeye I was craving with the blue cheese crust, and my girlfriend went with the Chilean sea bass. I had had the ribeye at the Guild House a week prior, and I have to say that this one was waaayyy better! The meat was cooked perfectly medium rare, and it basically melted in your mouth, and the blue cheese was pungent and blended with the steak perfectly. I could basically cut that thing with a fork.My girlfriend's sea bass was just as amazing and super delicate. The truffle sauce that came with it was delicious as were the whipped potatoes. We ordered a side of the jalapeno au gratin as well, and that was definitely one of the best potato dishes I've had in a while.Since it was my birthday, I got free dessert! Oh yeah! A nice gesture on an otherwise hefty bill. I could barely eat anymore, but I got the blueberry lemon cheesecake. It was just as good as everything else, but I had to pack up that bad boy for later.Overall, this is an awesome restaurant that you need to check out even if it's nestled in all of the Easton mayhem. It's obviously quite pricey so a great place to celebrate a special occasion (or if you have plenty of money to drop on dinner all the time. Kudos to you in that case). This is Cameron Mitchell at his best.",Gus W.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2005/10/16,"Amazing service, wonderful food and great ambience! Our waiter was top notch! Really enjoyed the fresh flavors of each dish.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,6/20/15,"Good, but could have been great!The consistency of highly rated reviews brought me to Mitchell's on a Monday night after a day of training teachers. The ambiance was welcoming and eloquent, so I immediately felt awkward in my t-shirt, casual pants, and sandals. I steered myself towards the bar hoping to find a haven and stumbled upon the last 15 minutes of happy hour + discount bar menu!I quickly ordered a Cab ($7) and the calamari w/ chili oil ($7). Both were delicious, but I could tell that my squid was a bit overdone and chewy. A patron to my left actually stopped eating his because he said it was too overdone. Me, I powered through because the chili dressing was so crazy delicious I didn't really care. Let's be honest, at times food is merely a vessel to get the sauce/dressing in your mouth. This was one of those cases.From the myriad reviews, I knew I should go with the Blackened Snapper and ordered another glass of wine (suddenly prices jumped from $7 to $12-15). I knew I'd be going over budget, but when my days typically start with yogurt for breakfast and a granola bar for lunch, I'm apt to delve into dinner and felt this would be the place to do it.When it arrived, the presentation of my fish was haphazard. Seeing images of the dish regularly on the Yelp site, I had expected a whole fillet. I, however, was presented with three pieces all tilted uniquely at different angles with random vegetables and a hollandaise-like sauce strewn underneath. Not sure if this was because I was that ""t-shirt guy at the bar"" or if it was an off night?The dish was solid, but the fish was inconsistently cooked like my calamari. Edges on the thinner segments were chewy and overdone. The corn spoon bread underneath didn't seem to complement the dish well, although I understand cultural pairing, but I did enjoy the sauce (as I tend to enjoy most sauces/dressings).Overall it was an expensive night and not up to the par Mitchell's price point and reviews suggested. At the same time, the ambiance, celebratory enthusiasm (a couple's engagement was celebrated with a specially dish and several cheers), and high standards made me give it 4 instead of 3 stars. I will give Mitchell's a second chance if I'm ever in town and will see if dressing up + sitting at a table will elevate the service...?",Josh M.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2001/8/17,"Incredible experience from A to Z. I was extremely skeptical visiting Mitchell's being attached to a mall. However, Mitchell's far exceeded my expectations from service to food. We were seated in one of their private dining rooms and enjoyed the privacy and comfort this area offered. Our table of 3 started with the goat cheese ravioli which was simply of out this world.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,11/19/16,"Went with my girlfriend for a nice steak dinner on Sunday and we were not disappointed. We weren't planning on drinking with dinner, but found out shortly after we sat down that they have 50% off bottles of wine on Sunday nights. Our waiter was overly accommodating with tastings as we selected a bottle and gave us great recommendations based on our preferences. The ribeye is the BEST in Columbus and maybe the best I've ever had (even better than Jeff Ruby's Kobe Beef ribeye). It was the perfect temperature and delicately seasoned. The butter cake is to die for and I would highly recommend getting the carrot cake to go to enjoy with your morning coffee. *** helpful hint: you can take the wine bottle to go if you don't finish it with dinner",Spencer C.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2001/11/16,"Another trip to Ocean Club, and yet again another home run!My fiancee and I decided to go out for a nice dinner this evening, and we decided on the Ocean Club as it has yet to let us down.  Once again, this proved true!We arrived at around 5:20 pm for our 5:30 reservations and were seated immediately.  As always, we had a fantastic server; on this occasion it was Nick.  We started off with a Passion Martini for me and a Black Orchid for the future wife.  Both were great, and I even ended up going with a second Passion Martini because it was so delicious (along with fun, it's one of the drinks that smoke when it's poured!).The typical Ocean Club bread bowl came out, which is always superb.  Some pretzel bread sticks along with what I think is a loaf of sourdough.  Fantastic!  We got our orders in for some appetizers:  the Point Judith Calamari (this is a MUST every visit!  SO GOOD!), and I asked NIck his opinion on the Shrimp Saute vs the Crab Cake.  He suggested the Saute and it turned out to be a great choice.  Three large crostini type breadsticks with cheese on top resting in a delicious Tabasco cream sauce, with four GARGANTUAN shrimp, which were perfectly cooked.  My fiancee wanted to drink up the broth, it was that delectable!  In the past, we've also tried the Fondue, which was great, but on that occasion we had a larger party to share with so it made a little more sense.  Still, at the end of the night, we ended up with 2 bags of food to take home so that point might be moot!Our entrees for the night were the Yellowfin Tuna (w/ fava beans, marbled potatoes, and truffle jus) for me; my better half had the Lobster Bisque along with the Chop Chop Salad.  As always, everything scored high across the board.  The tuna melted in my mouth!  I tried a sample of the Bisque and wish I had a cup of it as well.  I didn't try the salad but my date said it was fantastic as well.  Along with all of this, we ordered a side of the lobster mashed potatoes, which, honestly, how could you go wrong with that?  Fantastic!We had to decline on desert (unfortunately) because we both were stuffed, and ended up leaving with a full box of the calamari, along with the extra bread, soup, and mashed potatoes that we couldn't finish.  I promise all of you, within the next two hours (it is currently 1:33 AM), those will be gone.  No which way about it!I don't know at this point what other praises I can give this restaurant.  I'll leave it in the words of my fiancee after she took her first bite of the Shrimp Saute: ""Honestly, I don't know if you can go wrong with anything here.""  I agree wholeheartedly; we have never had anything here that we didn't enjoy immensely.  Yes, you will pay a little more than if you were to hit up something like Northstar, or Applebee's, but the food is in a whole other stratosphere compared to those places.  And somehow it's still cheaper than other ""fine dining"" in the Easton area!  Go, and go now.  Call ahead and have that calamari waiting for you for when you get there.  You will not be disappointed, and your addiction will begin.  The sweetest addiction I've ever had!",Zack S.,,,,,,

It's Karen who served me and my friends tonight. We told her not to put any mango in the lobster roll since one of my friends is allergic to mango. However, after we finished our dishes, my friend's lips started to burn. Mango is the only thing that he is allergic to so we asked the server to come. She didn't feel sorry at all and said my friend's lips look no different from before. We asked her to confirm with the chef and she didn't come back immediately. She walked around and around and finally came back and said the chef definitely didn't put any mango in the food. I said I felt really bad because I took my friends here but my friends got allergic for no reason. The server just said well I don't know what to do cuz I'm not a doctor!

Where do I start?... The location at Easton Park Shopping Center is great because there are many people even from out of town that are familiar with this area. The decor was really nice and in the summer you can sit on the patio/balcony and enjoy the nice weather! Everything inside the restaurant looks nice, modern and luxurious. The service was amazing. Our waitress was very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly! She was awesome and we let the manager know what great of a job she did!Now to the important part: The Food! We went there for seafood although they offer quite the variety of Prime Steaks (will have to try that next time)! We started with Lobster Bisque - one of the best ever! Roasted Beet Salad with a Goat Cheese Mousse which was incredible... Had some oysters on the half shell and they were really fresh and meaty. Our entrÌ©es were Arctic Char and Blackened Snapper - both cooked perfectly and paired with some amazing garnishes! The food was so flavorful in every bite and everything came together just perfect! We did share 2 half side dishes: the very popular Smoked Gouda Tots (which were amazing) and the Brussell Sprouts which never fail to please my taste buds! We definitely did not have room for desert, but we'll have to try it next time!Overall, everything was amazing and we'll be returning soon!

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,7/19/16,We came here thinking that it must be good with all the high reviews. It turns out quite mediocre though. The service was lacking as well.

I almost spoiled my meal with the pretzel rolls/sticks. The smoking seafood tower was impressive, and I've never had a tower with dry ice. Some of the drinks even contained dry ice! I ordered the lobster tails, and they were delicious. The butter was served in it's own little bowl over a flame, which was a nice touch. No one in our party of 8 had any complaints about the meal, and we all ordered something different - from steak to crab to grouper. Our server was attentive and didn't mind that we're a bit of an odd bunch. If you're looking for great seafood in the middle of Ohio, this is the place!",Emily T.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2012/11/16,"The Ocean Club is a favorite of mine and my husbands. We go when we want a good meal and don't mind splurging. We always get the tuna and filet and do our surf and turf. Both items are always cooked perfectly. Sides are amazing - jalapeÌ±o au gratin potatoes, truffle mac and cheese to name a couple. Service is also spectacular. Highly recommend.",Crystal M.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2012/9/16,"I would give more stars if I could. Hands down the best restaurant in Columbus! Best service, food and martinis. Everything is top notch. Ryan and the bartenders are awesome. Thank you for being so wonderful.",Jenny V.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2005/10/16,"100% 5 stars! Everything was perfect from the moment we walked in, to the moment we left. This restaurant is located in Easton Town Center, which is a super cute shopping/eating district. SOOOO many good restaurants and shops, I wish we would've had a day to spend there. Anyways, we had a 9:15 PM reservation. Sat down and ordered Martinis (Bubbles and Berry), and an appetizer. Our waiter was super friendly, made conversation with us, and very attentive. He brought us a basket of warm, yummy bread while waiting for our drinks. For an appetizer, we ordered the calamari, which was really good and they split it in the back. Had an Asian flair to it, with tons of flavor. For our meals, I ordered the 8 oz filet and black truffle mac and my mom ordered the double lobster tail. Both were incredible, cooked flawlessly. Kinda cool  to find out this was the original Ocean Prime.",Brittany C.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,12/30/16,"We didn't have dinner here, only drinks and appetizers but they were sooooooo good!!!! I had a pear fuzz drink and we ate calamari and fondue. If it wasn't such a nice restaurant I would have scraped the fondue cup with my fingers and licked the plates. It was that good. Can't wait to come back for dinner!!",Marianne M.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,2011/2/15,"Mitchell's Ocean's Club is an upscale seafood favorite. As you'd imagine it is one of the wonderful Cameron Mitchell restaurants, which usually indicates that the meal is going to be high caliber. It is nicely nestled on the second floor of Easton Town Center Mall.  The interior was filled with upscale Maritime decor from the portholes and wooden-clad pillars. It reminded me of being on a luxury cruise liner.As for options, there is a myriad of both seafood and steak options. Since it's considered an ""Ocean Club"", I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass, which I've had before at one of its competitors. The Sea Bass arrived steaming hot with a slightly flaky crust - just how I like it. The fish tasted fresh and was full of flavor. The fish was decently sized and I could barely finish it since it was so rich. My only gripe was that the sauce was a little oily and just didn't pair as well with the fish. I preferred pan Asian style that is offered at other restaurants.Final verdict: I'd definitely come here again, but would probably reserve ordering Chilean Sea Bass at a restaurant that offers it pan Asian style. Also, I was happy to report service was phenomenal.",Adam J.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,3/19/16,"We went to Mitchell's Ocean Club for our 3rd anniversary.  I let them know when making the reservations online, and they made our night really special.  We arrived on time and they sat us right away.Starting with the bread, I think the pretzel bread is a unique addition to the typical bread bowl.We shared a bowl of lobster bisque.  I liked the corn fritters and lobster chunks in the soup.  It was creamy and rich, but rather mild compared to other lobster bisques.  I'm used to having more spice or pepper.I ordered the blackened snapper and my husband ordered the small filet.  We got parmesan truffle fries for the side.  When our waiter found out we were splitting everything, he offered to split our entrees as well.  That was great because it made splitting more even.  The filet was awesome--perfect temperature/color inside and very tender.  The fish was less tender than I expected, but I liked the corn spoon bread and vegetables that went with it.  I liked that the fries were thick, but not thick like steak fries, and had a crispy crust all the way around.  We had way too much delicious food, plus dessert was on the house since it was our anniversary.  We split the warm butter cake with ice cream and berries.  I loved that the cake was crusty on the outside, but warm and gooey on the inside.",Amy W.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,1/24/17,"Mitchell's Ocean Club is fantastic. The service is great, food is great, and there are plenty of options. On Sunday their wine (that isn't on the reserve list) is half off. Our server was great and the ambiance is perfect for date night, special occasions, drinks at the bar with friends (there is a very large bar area), or a night out to treat yourself. Expect to pay a good amount of money, but it's worth it. The reason I didn't give Mitchell's Ocean Club a 5 is because nearly everything is packed with butter. It would be nice to have a bit more variety for healthier sides and dishes.",Tori F.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,3/17/15,"I love the Ocean Club. It is by and far my favorite restaurant at Easton. It also happens to be tied with Cap City as my favorite Cameron Mitchell restaurant. Although it's a pricy restaurant, I would much rather splurge here than at Cameron Mitchell's similarly pricy M Restaurant. Location: It's at Easton, which is in my opinion the best shopping mall in Columbus. Don't want to park in the parking garage (which admittedly can be a cluster)? There's valet parking right outside the restaurant. Interior: Beautifully decorated, clean, not too loud, romantic, and in the warmer months with the option of outdoor patio seating.Service: Impeccable. I've always had great service here, and that's considering my first time here was at least 14 years ago!Food: From the wisconsin cheddar fondue appetizer to the salad to the seafood, I've enjoyed every dish I've ever had here. Even more amazing, in my opinion, is the fact that despite being named the ""Ocean Club"", I seriously think they have the best steak in Columbus! Their 14oz NY Strip Steak is to die for.Writing this review is actually making me crave the Ocean Club again... I'll definitely be back!",Kaoru M.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2012/5/16,"The best restaurant in Columbus and never disappoints! John W is an amazing server and we ask for him every time. As far as food goes you could close your eyes and point at the menu and you'd still never end up with something you don't like. We tend to gravitate towards the chilled crab legs appetizer, short rib appetizer, and the grouper is outstanding. Steaks are great too. Don't forget Mac and cheese. I could go on forever",Lauren E.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2005/12/16,"Five-star dining, for sure... impeccable service, elegant presentation, superb dishes. I wished it wasn't in Easton, but I get it. I ordered the Black Orchid cocktail, which was poured over an orchid flower frozen in ice... and it tasted as yummy as it was pretty. The fondue appetizer was good, but I'd probably try another rather than order it again. The bread service included the most amazing sourdough bread I've ever tasted... seriously. Our halibut and Chilean sea bass were both perfect, the asparagus is terrific, and the jalapeÌ±o au gratin is a must-try. After all that I still couldn't resist the creme brÌÈlÌ©e for dessert, and I was thrilled with it... tons of vanilla flavor but not overly sweet. Good for a celebration or occasion (or just dinner on a Tuesday night for the 1%)... it's pricey. But if you appreciate fine dining and seafood, you need to visit Ocean Club.",Corin C.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2005/10/16,"Cameron Mitchell hits another home run with this one. This place is so elegant and lavish. Cameron sure knows how to bring some class to the Easton shopping center.The decor is beautiful and the waiting staff is extremely knowledgable and helpful. We ordered 2 dozen of the blue point oysters, and they were the largest that I had ever seen! They were DELICIOUS! The presentation is phenomenal. You will have to order them to see, but I can tell you it involves some dry ice theatrics. I ordered the New York strip and loved it. Others at the table thoroughly enjoyed the grouper. The sides are fantastic! The creamy spinach, Mac and cheese, and tater tots were some popular choices at our table. The MAC AND CHEESE is out of this world! Some of the best I have ever had. I cannot say enough about how wonderful our waiter was. He was very timely, friendly, and accommodating. The prices can be quite intimidating, but the food lives up to the price. I am no millionaire, and obviously couldn't afford to eat here every day, but this is perfect for special occasions.",Les C.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,1/31/16,"My boyfriend and I came here to enjoy a night out.  Upon arrival the hostess looked us up and down and decided to place us in a back room- I was wearing a pencil skirt and nice top while my boyfriend was in nice jeans and a button down. We were placed in the corner of the private room 2 and I was extremely disappointed. I felt like we were on the misfit island. It was so bizarre and I almost had the audacity to ask to be moved. I don't want to come off as pretentious, but we go out a lot and we really wanted to enjoy the atmosphere of The Ocean Club. I felt that being shoved in the corner took away half of the experience.Onto the service- our server was cool and chill. Not the same type of professionalism you'd expect at the Refectory or Ruth's Chris, but we still liked him a lot. We each got a cocktail- passion fruit and the elderflower- they were good and had dry ice in then which was cool. As appetizers we ordered the surf and turf- Scallops, mashed potatoes, and bomb short rib- hearty, umami-yum! We also ordered the chilled crab meat cocktail and the shrimp sautÌ©. The shrimp was a bit fibrous, but the sauce was delicious. The crab was tasty too! We then had a bottle of the Starmont cabarnet and it had an awesome smoky flavor! We moved onto a Cesar salad and the lobster bisque. The bisque was tasty and they poured the soup on top of the croutons and lobster once it reached the table. My Cesar was ok, not amazing, not bad. Main courses: we ordered the blackened snapper, grouper, truffle Mac and cheese and the creamed spinach. Snapper was very good! Lots of flavor and delicious with the corn spoon bread. My grouper was different... It was in a broth with peas, some gnocchi, and the fish had a tomato sauce/ paste on top which was a strange flavor mixed with the almost chicken like broth. The Mac and cheese was absolutely delicious! Anything truffle wins my vote! The creamed spinach was smokey and made with bacon fat. Overall the food was pretty good! However, the experience for $350 that we spent was seriously lacking. This is why I took away 2 stars. We are huge foodies and like to try lots of things, ambience in a restaurant like The Ocean Club is important- I felt like we didn't have any type of feel for the restaurant and I was very disappointed with this part of the experience.",Stefanie D.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,10/30/16,We dined here for my fiance's birthday. Our waitress went out of her way to make the night special. I had the crab cakes and he had the scallops. You have to try the passion martini! Our waitress also suggested that we order half sizes of sides so we didn't get too much food. She was right! This place is great for a special night out!,Rachelle T.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,3/15/16,"We booked a table for 6 people on a Friday evening, for a birthday celebration and had a fairly ok time.We all arrived to the restaurant on time and had to wait a good 15 minutes to be seated, which was fine. Problem is, they seated us close to the bar, which was noisy, a little crazy and I got to hear guys swearing like sailors for our whole meal.Our waitress was pretty awesome and she guided us through the various food options we could explore. We chose a seafood cascade of sorts for our appetizer, which included some huge shrimp, some very tasty oysters and a bowl of crab meat. Combined with the sauces that came with the tower, we quickly emptied the whole thing in what seemed like seconds.Funny thing was, they had taken our drink order and had also taken our starters order but we still had these large menus we had to hold onto, as they had not yet taken our entree order. It seemed like we had been seated for almost an hour before we got to ""finish"" ordering our food. So, we finally got around to ordering entrees and I chose the the NY strip steak. Not sure why I ordered a steak when at a seafood restaurant, but what the hell, we only live once, right? My wife ordered the Red Snapper and our friends ordered the Grouper and the Sea Bass. We still were shouting to each other, just to have a conversation and the bar area seemed to have gotten even louder by the time our dinner arrived. The table behind me had two guys telling stories to each other, bragging about things like chasing people with M****F**** guns, plus the one guy smelled like cheap aqua velva...yuck. So anyway our food arrived and it was mostly good, but not great. I did really like the steak, as it was crusty on the outside yet a nice medium rare in the middle. The problem was with the side dishes, as they were bland. We finished the evening with a couple of desserts to share, which were fine but when the bill came (over $500.00 for the six of us), we weren't sure it was worth it.I guess we were expecting more bang for our buck and all we got was a little ""pop"".Not sure if we will ever return.",Jay P.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2/20/15,"I had a fabulous birthday dinner here! It was pretty crowded for a Tuesday evening, so definitely make reservations, even on weeknights. We started with the surf and turf appetizer: braised short ribs, scallops and risotto. I would've ordered two more of this dish to have as my main entree- it was a great combo and so delicious!We also enjoyed our entrees: Chilean sea bass and a medium rare perfectly cooked filet. I hardly ever order fish entrees, but I was pleased with the sea bass. I couldn't finish it though because I wanted to make room for dessert! In a previous visit, I had the teriyaki salmon and it was great too- the sticky rice and soy butter sauce made that dish! Side dishes: I had high expectations for the lobster mashed potatoes and it ended up being pretty good, but the black truffle mac and cheese was by far the better side dish! I could've had a whole bowl of it! You can definitely taste the truffle!For dessert, I couldn't decide between the carrot cake and chocolate cake with ice cream. Well, our server couldn't tell us which was better, so he brought out both for us! They were both excellent and so decadent! The carrot cake was 10 amazing layers and came with pineapple syrup, which I didn't care for too much, but it was drizzled on the side. I loved both, but I have to say that I think the carrot cake was better. My husband favored the chocolate cake. We were eating leftover cake for two days after and we enjoyed every single bite. :)",Helen S.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2/19/16,"If you're willing to throw down some cash for a fancy night out, this is s great choice. This is the second time my wife and I have enjoyed ocean club and it's still a great place for great food! If you're visiting in a Friday or Saturday, I recommend getting a reservation. It's not exactly a hidden gem.Both times we've dined here we've enjoyed the goat cheese ravioli, it's so flavorful but not as heavy as you'd think. We both had the filet this time except I chose the truffle butter and the Mrs. Chose the blu cheese. We both agreed the truffle butter was much better but don't let me talk you out of the blu cheese. If you're craving blu cheese, you won't be disappointed.",Daniel W.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,3/19/15,"Since moving to Ohio a few months ago, my man and I have really struggled to find good food; chain restaurants seem to reign supreme here. This is probably the only restaurant we've found that can compare to the restaurants in other places we've lived--Seattle, LA, and New York. (We've still got a lot of exploring to do.)We love our seafood and this place in the middle of Ohio, does not disappoint. The first time we went we ordered two salmon dishes, but ended up fighting over the teriyaki salmon so we now know to both order that every time we go back. That dish is fantastic. The cocktails are overpriced in my opinion, but I do appreciate the showmanship with the dry ice they use. It's fun to watch your martini bubble in front of you.We've tried a couple of different appetizers here, and my favorites have been the crabcakes and the ahi tuna. They are pretty pricey, but I haven't tried one yet that I didn't think was worth it. We were here last for my husband's birthday and they gave us the dessert special on the house (brown butter cake) and it was so fantastic. The best cake I have ever had. Best of all, the service in this place is fantastic. We are 3 for 3 for seamless dining experiences here with fantastic waiters and I can't wait to go back for #4.",Sarah N.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,1/31/16,"Meh. In terms of cocktail and desserts, it was pretty good. I heard it was a great place for dessert and drinks and I had a craving for carrot cake ($11). Since they have the reputation of having the best in Columbus, I had to try it. Pretty good. A tall slice of ten layers held together with a subtle cream cheese frosting and thankfully no chunks of fruit like you find in some. I could have done without the Pineapple Syrup but that's me be picky. Other than that, I might get it again. Worth $11, not too sure. I've definitely had better for cheaper but I recommend you trying it or yourself.The Black Orchid cocktail ($11) was beautiful, accented with what looked to be an orchid flower frozen inside an ice cube sphere, but I didn't care for the choice of raspberry vodka. Made it taste too artificial. The Pear Grapefruit Fizz ($12) definitely wasn't worth the price point, leaving me wanting a lot more out of it. Tasted flat, in flavor and texture.I definitely need to try the dinner menu and report back.",Matt P.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,10/20/14,My husband and I hadn't been here for a couple years so we figured a return trip was due. We started off with cocktails I had the Black Orchid and he had the Whiskey Clover and we both loved them. We ordered the colossal shrimp cocktail and omg I love their cocktail sauce as it has the right amount of horseradish. We also received the hot bread which includes the pretzel sticks and sourdough and the pretzel sticks are yummy. I ordered the scallops with Parmesan risotto and English peas with citrus vinaigrette and my hubby got the blackened snapper with a side of lobster mashed potatoes. Wow our tastebuds were super happy my scallops were cooked perfectly and I got a nice chunk of lobster in every bite of the mashed potatoes. I knew husband was happy because he barely spoke and his snapper was almost gone. We will definitely not wait so long for our next visit!,Suzanne F.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2005/10/15,"Let me start off with the first bad experience we had in the beginning. We made reservations for 8 for 9pm and then needed to add just one more person. The front desk was completely rude and said they can't accommodate one more person and thinks all the seats will be taken. I never heard of a restaurant not trying to make small accommodations, especially with a upper scale restaurant like this! So our 9th person went anyways and they easily added another chair to the table. Not sure why the front desk made it a huge deal over the phone.Anyways, my bad first impression changed after we met with the staff. They were very attentive, friendly, engaging, and went above and beyond. Our waiter, John, handled our party quite well considering it was a bachelorette so you can imagine the girls getting a bit loud and ""crazy"" especially with alcohol. He noticed our drink wasn't bubbling not the way it was supposed to and offered to get us an extra one on the house.The drinks were strong and tasty, just how I like them! Everything I tasted was delicious from the lobster cake, Chilean sea bass, the bread and butter, ribeye, and the absolute tastiest of them all...my blackened snapper! It had a bit of heat to it, the cornbread and tar tar is what makes this dish so good. Everyone literally cleaned their plate and not a piece of food was on it. They gave us complementary dessert with a party so big and how much we spent....the dessert was so good! I loved the extra chocolate cake/mousse; it wasn't too sweet which is great. Peanut butter/chocolate was amazing as well. Didn't care too much for the vanilla cake.Yes, it's pricey...but is definitely money well worth spent and I left with a belly full. I definitely want to come back and try this place out with my boyfriend on a nice outing.",Michelle S.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,7/16/16,We eat out super often.  This place is AMAZING.  You can tell that they take major pride in what they are cooking.  They aren't skimping when they hire their chefs.  Every single thing I've tried is just to die for.  Last night we tried the Dynamite Roll (sushi).  Holy moly amaaaaaazing!  My boyfriend even loved it and he's not even a big fan of sushi.  Try it. Trust me.  You will LOVE it.  Thanks so much for having such a perfectly yummy place for us to eat!!!  Don't ever change your service or quality of food standard.  They are both superior.  I would also recommend the chop chop salad and the halibut meal!  So deliciously perfect!,Shannon M.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,10/22/14,"Had an awesome anniversary dinner here with the Mrs.  Excellent, elegant food capped off with superior service set the tone for a wonderful night.  We began with a split of two appetizers, the ravioli and the crab cake.  Both were great.  I got the King Salmon which did not disappoint.  Perhaps the star of dinner, however, were the loaded tater tots.  They were amazing and a lovely ""big-kid"" accompaniment to such a top-shelf meal.  A nice offset, there.  The house comped a ten-layer cheesecake due to our anniversary and that's never a bad thing.  We used to go to the Melting Pot for anniversary dinners and decided to change it up this year.  Ocean Club has earned a future customer for sure.",Mike D.,,,,,,

The food wasOkay, but service lacked and didn't make you feel welcome as they rushed you to get the next table.Made reservations and talked to the male manager at noon about making sure as a service organization they could be accommodating, he answered no before even understanding the issues.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2009/9/14,"Every thing was perfect: food, atmosphere and staff.I never had such good tasting calamari before. I am definitely going back but only on for a special occasion. The prices are high but it is definitely worth every bit!",Kellyann M.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,12/17/15,"As my 1st time back here in about 10 years, I was anxiously awaiting this visit for my birthday a couple of weeks ago. The service and food did not disappoint. We started off with a wedge salad and calamari. Even split between 2 people the salad was a nice portion, and the calamari had a nice sweet yet slightly spicy sauce. For entrees we had the seafood bass and ribeye/Oscar style. Everything was so good! Fish and steak cooked perfectly. We also had a side of the lobster mashed potatoes. I've had these before at M, another Cameron Mitchell restaurant and couldn't wait to try again. They put ALOT of lobster in it so I definitely think the price is worth it. Also, the cocktails here are like works of art. It was my 1st time trying the Black Orchid which is probably the most popular cocktail at CM restaurants. While it is good, I think the Bubbles and Berries is my favorite. It's a real show when they pour it up for you. When I made my reservation on Open Table I mentioned it was my birthday and they did bring it up during service. My boyfriend and I both got complimentary desserts. Not your typical little birthday cupcake or anything either. I had a berry cheesecake and his was something with chocolate and peanut butter. It was honestly some of the best cheesecake I've ever had. The other dessert tasted like a big Reese's cup! Delicious, but probably not for people who don't like really rich desserts. While it's not someplace most people can dine at regularly, it's a great pick for a special occasion. Before I forget, the outdoor terrace is covered/heated during the winter! Big plus!! We were able to sit in view of the holiday lights :-)",Brittany R.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,2008/1/14,"Went there for my wife's birthday, always a good idea to make a reservation, there is always a wait if you don't have a reservation. I made a reservation online and mentioned it was my wife's birthday.When we arrived the staff was very pleasant and they wished my wife for her birthday. Very courteous staff, once we were seated our waitress filled our water and gave us an ipad with the drink menu, my wife ordered the black orchid and she loved it, very creative drink with a flower inside the ice cube. The house bread basket was not bad, I expected better bread for such an upscale place.We ordered the lobster bisque and colossal shrimp saute. The appetizers came out pretty quick, the lobster bisque was pretty good but was overpowered by tarragon, it was not bad but I have had better, the colossal shrimp had some great crispy garlic  cheese flat bread to soak up the Tabasco cream sauce, the shrimp was jumbo not colossal, but it had great flavors.For the main course we had the Alaskan Halibut with lobster gnocchi and Sea Scallops with risotto. Both the entrees were pretty good, the sea scallops were a bit overdone but the risotto was great, the Alaskan halibut was executed well and had great flavors. We ordered the jalapeno scalloped potatoes, they were good as well.They gave us a dessert on the house, even though we were too full, our waitress said they will give us one to go for the birthday occasion, that was a nice touch, they gave us the dessert in a to go container with a candle and happy birthday written with ganache :).I give the service 5 stars and the food 3 stars, hence the 4 star review, the food is pretty good, but for the price, you expect more. The best part of the meal were the cocktails and the shrimp appetizer and of course the exceptional service.",Firdoze C.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,2011/7/15,"The fresh oysters were presented on an iced bed of sea weed with lemon, fresh horseradish,  and cocktail sauce. Our filet was seasoned just enough to accentuate without overpowering the quality of the beef and cooked to our exact specification.  The waitress was prompt and courteous and the table presentation and maintenance was worthy of a 4 star establishment. This was our second visit with the same first rate experience. The only drawback was the level of noise which is understandable in a popular restaurant on a Friday night.",DevoMaryAnn M.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,10/15/15,"Good, just missing greatness.  Drinks are always well made. I had the whiskey clover and would have it again. 14oz New York strip (non-aged) was a 7.5 out of 10.  Nice char, better than average seasoning and taste.  It did however come up short on the finish.  Just slightly over medium rare and not warm through out.  I have personally made better steaks but I would eat this one again.  The Gouda tater tots were sub par at best as evidenced by they're overly dense filling.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2/13/16,"Absolutely incredible. You get what you pay for that's for sure. I can only imagine going here once every couple years but it is well worth the money you will spend. To start, my fiancee and I split the fondue appetizer which was the perfect starter. The cheese had great flavor and the veggies and meats to dip in it were fresh and fit very well with the aged cheddar. Big portions of food, perfect for two.For the main course I had the arctic char. Great flavor and the lemon butter sauce that it was cooked and served in had great flavor but was not overpowering. The fish came with a quinoa and brussel sprout concoction which was sweet, I believe it had a raisin and almonds in it too, and was a good flavor combination. This meal was delicious.The service was great and our server was eager to answer all of our questions and made great recommendations.",Tom D.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2005/11/14,"The service and food here are spectacular.  I've enjoyed the snapper, sea bass, lobster tail entree, lobster mashed potatoes, truffle mac and cheese, shrimp sautÌ©,and lobster bisque.  Everything has been extraordinary but the sea bass and lobster mashed potatoes are simply bliss.  The service makes you feel like dining here itself is an exclusive event.  The portions are reasonable, the prices on average for an appetizer or side is 15-20$ and 30-40$ for an entree.  They serve sourdough and pretzel bread as well.  I love coming here to celebrate birthdays as the food and service is always excellent.  They also give free desserts for birthdays.  It's easy to spend 75-100$ per person here but the fine dining with fantastic seafood makes it worth it.  When thinking about an exceptional dining experience, i think Ocean Club.",Sharmeela S.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,5/27/15,Came here with a large group of coworkers and was disappointed at the sea bass after all the hype I've been reading and hearing. Everything else was like appetizers and sides were good. I had a cheaper sea bass at another restaurant in Columbus that pretty much kicked this one in the butt.,Will Y.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2010/8/15,"I got married last week (whoo!) and we were looking for a somewhat fancier restaurant to celebrate without the rest of the family around. The Ocean Club fit the bill very nicely. Not only was the food fantastic but the service was stellar. We made reservations off their website (super easy) and mentioned that we would be celebrating our wedding and love desserts. When we arrived for our reservations, we found a bottle of champagne waiting for us and our server informed us that dessert was on the house. (The champagne was a gift from my in-laws.) Then he popped the bubbly and we went to town on the menu. We started with the jumbo crab cake. Our server had the kitchen split it for us so we didn't have to fight over it. It was really good; a lot of crab, a little cake and some damn tasty sauce on top. Just enough heat to balance the sweet crab. For dinner, I went with the blackened snapper and my husband went for the twin lobster tails. The snapper was fantastic and the jalapeno spoonbread was so tasty. The lobster tails were a good size and my hubby enjoyed them very much. Another tic in the ""awesome service"" category: when he had emptied one of the shells, our server stopped by to remove it. At any other place, the shells would've stayed until they bused the table. For dessert, well, we ended up having both of our desserts comped. I went with the 10 layer carrot cake and he went for the warm butter cake. Both were awesome. I brought about half the carrot cake home and had it for breakfast the next day. We had a great time here and, since it is pricey, we'll be back for a special occasion.",Stephanie P.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,7/19/15,"My wife and I went on Saturday night. We were able to get a reservation same night. The attire was pretty dressy. Almost all the guys were in nice pants. The environment is really nice inside. As first timers there the waiter explained the whole menu and was very helpful. We had oysters as an appetizer. They were phenomenal. You can actually order them by piece. I had the French onion soup and it was pretty good. I ordered the filet. Legitimately the best filet I have ever had. Our waiter, Chip, was awesome and recommended the blackened snapper for my wife. She absolutely loved it. One of the best meals she had ever had. For the price and in general, we highly recommend dinner here as a couple or as a group.",Alex G.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,7/21/16,"It's the only place I want to go that's not within walking distance of where we live downtown. It's worth the drive--and I cry about anything that's longer than approximately 5 minutes. This place will always be a little extra special to me because of how accommodating they are, which I suppose is a luxury that comes with restaurants with a head chef. I mentioned to the server that I was saddened because they no longer had a vegetarian pasta dish I had loved. She said, ""No problem. I'll double-check, but I'm sure the chef would make it for you."" And he did. And it was as perfect as always. The server also said that she'd have the goat cheese ravioli made with vegetable broth instead of the usual chicken. Just melts my heart. I don't like pie. I really don't. However, they gave us a free desert (and two free glasses of champs!) for our anniversary, so we got the peanut butter pie. It made me believe that Jesus has graced the earth with his presence again, and it is as this peanut butter pie. It's basically chocolate ganache over peanut butter mousse. Any further description would be an insult, because I could never do it justice. Order it. And visit OC.",Ash S.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,4/27/14,Just a great place for business or a romantic date. I will be back when I am in Columbus. I would say that this place can be right up there with any 5 star restaurant in the country. This is really a food gem.,Hugh P.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,3/23/14,"After all the stores closed at 7pm at Easton on a Sunday night, I decided to check out the restaurant scene. Of all the options, Mitchell's rose to the top of all the rankings, so I decided to check this place out. Walking up to the second floor of a mall, I was skeptical at first, but don't be deceived by its location. The food, service, and ambiance were top notch and second to none. My server Scott has got to be the most attentive and conscientious server I've ever encountered. He made some excellent recommendations and really made an effort throughout the evening to ensure I was enjoying my meal and drinks. I ordered the elderflower martini and it was amazing, one of the best drinks I've ever imbibed. The presentation was also very dramatic, in a good way. When he poured it out of the shaker, the drink started bubbling and fogging up. It looked pretty cool! Not many places carry dry ice these days. For my entree, I had the blackened snapper and snap peas. The snapper was pretty good, but not the best that I've had. The bread basket was awesome. There were soft pretzels that were hot out of the oven. For dessert I had the chocolate peanut butter torte. This dessert was so divine and decadent. The texture of the torte was very fluffy and not too dense, definitely the best peanut butter dessert I've ever experienced. Overall, I had a wonderful experience and I'll definitely be back!",Jonathan L.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,7/19/14,"This open mall in Columbus is so lovely. There were a concert going.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,1/28/16,"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary dinner. The place is very nicely set up, and gorgeous. The service was awesome! Never left us needing something, we were always taken care of.It was a little loud for fine dining though. I expected to be a little less noisy and more romantic. I guess it's not the restaurants fault though, they don't actually have a noise policy, lol. Would have been a lot nicer if it were a little more quiet to make it romantic.The food was delicious, portions however were a little small for the prices. Which are super freaking expensive. We both ordered steak with some sides. The steaks came out beautifully cooked and melted in our mouths! The calamari and lobster mashed potatoes we ordered came out just as nice. My only problems are the small portion sizes with very large prices and the loud atmosphere. This won't be stopping me from dining here again though. To be more specific on the pricing part.. For two drinking water ordering steaks and two sides it was around $130. BUT since it was for a special occasion they served us yummy carrot cake on the house which was very nice! I guess that's their thing. Which is pretty cool!",Stephanie J.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,2007/7/14,"I celebrated a birthday at the ocean club last week and I must admit I was very impressed. My initial opinion was how nice could a high end restaurant be when it is connected to a shopping center? The decor is very modern and it makes you feel like you're dining at a 5 star restaurant. We decide to sit outside, their patio is beautiful and it overlooks the outdoor shopping center.Our server was extremely nice and very professional. He educated us on the menu and helped us pick out the perfect bottle of wine. For an appetizer we order the calamari , it was cooked perfectly. I could've eaten the entire plate myself. It had a sweet chili sauce ad candied cashews. For dinner I orders a 10oz filet cooked medium rare. The steak came out a little over medium rare, but it was very delicious. I ordered the Au Poivre topping for my filet, its a black pepper topping. i enjoyed it. The sides are family style so we ordered a few for the table. My favorite had to be the jalapeÌ±o au gratin! Sliced potatoes and aged swiss. They were cooked perfectly. Finally for desert we had the white chocolate key lime tart. It was one of the best deserts I've ever had. Mitchell's Ocean Club is an amazing restaurant, be prepared to spend a lot of money though. It's definitely a special occasion spot.",Alex G.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,2003/1/15,"My wife and I went I had been looking for a place to replace McCormick and Schmick's. We have had pitiful service the last few times we have been there. This year we went to Mitchell's for a Valentine's Day celebration. The restaurant allows you to use OpenTable to set up reservations which is a big positive for me. The waiter was very friendly and very helpful with narrowing down dishes to pick from. We ended up with a nice Caesar salad and both of us had the king salmon dish. The food is a bit on the ""food art"" side but very tasty. I would go here again for a nice occasion.I don't drink but it looked like there was a healthy choice of wine.",Adam N.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,2005/2/16,"Update:Mitchell's is located in the Easton Town Center, which makes it a convenient stop after a day of shopping. I have always found the food to be very good, and they seem to put a lot of effort into their service. On my last visit, I tried the Prime Roll from their sushi list and the berries and bubbles cocktail to start. I should have read the ingredients before choosing that particular roll, but instead just ordered what I assumed to be the ""house"" roll. I would not really describe this as sushi at all, except in presentation. It was cooked shrimp, cream cheese, and green onion, surrounded by what I would consider to be an over-abundance of gummy sushi rice, covered in beef carpaccio. I would not recommend this dish for someone actually expecting anything close to sushi. The cocktail was presented table side, and was good, if a bit sweet.For my entree, I ordered the surf and turf special. It came with a lobster tail, 7oz filet, mashed potatoes, and asparagus for $64. Everything was prepared perfectly, and my steak was cooked exactly to order. I ordered a martini, stirred, to go with my entree, and this drink was also presented table side in a cocktail shaker, and shaken next to the table before being poured. I'll give it to the waiter--he really tried to earn points on presentation, but you are never going to win over a classic gin martini drinker by shaking the hell out of their drink right in front of them. I cringe thinking about it.The creme brÌÈlÌ©e for dessert was very good. Valet is convenient, and located in front of the restaurant.Previous:My dining experiences at the Ocean Club have always been absolutely excellent. During my last visit to Columbus, I stopped in for dinner, and had an absolutely superb waiter, Shawn, who was able to steer me in the right direction from my first cocktail (the Black Orchid), to a wine pairing that would work with the surf and turf special (which was spot on). I would also like to add that, although my mother and I ordered the same dish, we ordered our steaks prepared very differently--I ordered mine ""Pittsburgh,"" and she requested medium well, and both were cooked to perfection. The lobster roll sushi app wasn't half bad, either. Truly, I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant.",Natalie C.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,9/27/14,"This restaurant is delicious! The selection of food is very very good. The service is exceptional! Our server, Clint, was amazing!

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,4/27/15,The Ocean club is fabulous from the atmosphere to the service to the food. The Filet Mignon with truffle butter is one of my favorite dishes. Always cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.,Sabrina H.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,6/19/16,"Went to Mitchell's ocean club for dinner with high expectations based on the reviews, and while we had a great night, we were ultimately underwhelmed by the place.  I can be quite picky about details, but I think when you are paying top dollar prices then it should be all about the details, and that's where this place falls short.  The atmosphere was ok but we were seated in a room at the back which just didn't feel like it was part of the main restaurant.  Food: oysters were amazing to be fair (although unnecessarily accompanied with dry ice for smokey effect) but the rest of the meal was just ok.  Cocktails were nice but nothing special, and service was good (even if the waitress did lack discretion and manage to completely interrupt the conversation every time she came over).  The restrooms were messy with paper towels all over the floor, and a half empty family sized bottle of cheap moisturizer by the sink and dirty looking mouthwash....  Overall I think 3 stars might be a bit on the harsh side but too many people seem to be easily pleased dishing out 5* ratings willy nilly, and at $300 for 2 people this place is pricing themselves with the big boys so they need to be compared to them as well.  I doubt I will go back again as there are better places for food and price.",Sam K.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,9/21/14,"Possibly my favorite restaurant in Columbus for a date night.  Their wine and cocktail lists are great, and the food is always amazing.  My favorites are the scallops and sea bass, and even though I'm not a huge red meat eater I occasionally get a steak.  The service is always great in the dining room, but sometimes it's nice to just sit at the bar and listen to the piano (and stuff your face with truffle popcorn)This is one of the few places worth going to Easton for, in my opinion.",Lisa D.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,3/16/15,"I think this might be a chain, everything in Easton is. But I really like this place. Of the several times I have dined here, I found the food really nicely prepared. Everything was seasoned nicely and had an ideal texture suitable for each dish. I have even sipped their dry ice cocktail, not sure how safe it is, but it's really fun. I can't comment on the prices because each time we were here, was for a special date so we didn't mind!",Lisa M.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,6/21/16,"Something gets me about a place that serves their tap water unfiltered. Cooper's Hawk in the same shopping center is also guilty of this. Anyway. This place was ok. I got the surf and turf. I gave away the surf and didn't eat the turf. The mash was good. Loaded potato was ok. Asparagus was undercooked. I probably wouldn't eat here again, and I wouldn't say it was good. Thankfully I didn't pay. Pretzel rolls and sourdough were very good. Food service was extremely slow but server was pretty attentive. Ambiance leaves much to be desired, maybe outdoor seating would be better. Sushi appetizer was bad. Luckily there are a few more restaurants to try in Easton since I've been traveling here semi frequently for work.",Ryan B.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,9/21/13,"What a meal!  Recently attended my friend's thirtieth birthday celebration here and am still thinking about the great food and service.  John, our server (party of nine) was great at letting us know about the specials and his favorites.  I had two handcrafted cocktails, a cucumber gimlet and a manhattan.  The gimlet was expertly muddled and very refreshing.  Friends tried the calamari, cheese fondue, and tuna tartar tacos. I tried a bit of everything and loved the fondue and the tacos.  The calamari was not particularly memorable, as it is a variation of the calamari dish found in all the Cameron Mitchell restaurants.  For my meal I had the blackened red snapper with jalapeÌ±o cornbread.  What a great marriage of favors!  Though my fish was slightly overcooked, it was still very pleasant.  Also split the truffled mac and cheese with a friend.  Of all the sides, this is definitely the one to get and share with a friend.  Probably some of the best mac and cheese in town.  We finished the meal of with some creme brulee and the famed Baked Alaska.  Again, the creme brulee was nothing spectacular and was very standard.  However, I could write odes to the Baked Alaska.  Layers of ice cream and cake, topped with a fluffy meringue cover and drizzled with berry sauce.  Yum!  A perfect ending to a decadent and fabulous meal.",Anna S.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,2/13/15,"Went here for a business dinner and had great food.  Server was slightly over bearing,  but very responsive.   We both had fish dishes that are delicious.   Has a great atmosphere.   I will go back again on a future visit to Columbus.",Nicole Q.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2007/8/14,"I celebrated my anniversary here and was very impressed.As others have noted, most people are skeptical about this place simply because of where it's located.  I do agree that this restaurant should have its own building, just to set it apart as a fine-dining restaurant.  If you stroll in here with a t-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops, you are guaranteed to stand out.  The ambiance and dÌ©cor are very pleasant, the food and wine selections are impressive, and the service is outstanding. Our server was very knowledgeable, professional, and really nice. The appetizer (jumbo lump crab cake with sweet corn cream) was quite tasty. I had the New York Strip with the Maytag bleu cheese crust accessory, paired with a Cabarnet (Mount Veneer, Napa 2011).  For a side, I had the creamed spinach (without the bacon).  The steak was sublime, but I personally was not too keen on the accessory I picked. I'm not a dessert person, so if I do have dessert, it will typically be fruit.  My husband has a sweet tooth, so we had the ten layer carrot cake, which was simply heavenly.  He of course wiped out most of it, which is fine with me : )This was overall one of the best dining experiences I've had.  If you are visiting the area or just looking for a great dining experience, give them a try.  If this is too far and you live in/are closer to the downtown area, try the Mitchell's at 45 North Third Street.If you live in or close to Polaris, try the Mitchell's at 1408 Polaris Parkway.",Linda Janice G.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,3/27/16,Of all the Mitchell's restaurants in Columbus this is probably my favorite. Anything I get here whether it's meat or seafood is always great and amazing.

They have a great happy hour as well.,Malena N.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,8/24/14,"For Ohio easily the best seafood fine dining experience I've had.  Visually the restaurant has an outstanding decor, but the main dining room can become very loud.  My wife and I were pleased to be seated instead in one of the smaller dining rooms off the main room which only accommodates four tables.The service from Brittany was top notch:  attentive but never intrusive.  The drinks were fantastic.  We would come here just to sit at the bar.  The wife had the pineapple martini and I had the Elderflower La Poire.  Both come smoking and bubbling from what I can only imagine was a small piece of dry ice at the bottom of our glasses.  The visual effect was entertaining and both taste very good.  We appreciated the wine list, which was reasonably priced, and although we chose a bottle there were several selection by the glass to choose from.It seemed like many diners around us were choosing steak which seemed odd since it is a seafood restaurant with the fish flown in fresh daily.  We both ordered the lobster bisque, but it was a disappointment.  Not bad, but we've had better at Willie G's which has the best lobster bisque I've ever tried.  For main course, my wife had had the Chilean sea bass, which came resting on a bed of mashed potatoes.  I had the halibut in a bowl of delicious sauce with some very small gnocchi and a few shreds of lobster.  There was a big dollop of completely pointless tomato paste on top of my fish, but otherwise the dish was flavored perfectly.When we go back we'll skip the soup and perhaps try a side or salad instead.  For fresh well prepared seafood, the Ocean Club is a good choice.",Roger D.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,2001/3/15,"A really lovely place to enjoy dinner, have been here a few times now and it never disappoints. Some highlights for food are their oysters Rockefeller and king salmon. Their surf and turfs (they usually have 1-2 different varieties, depends on the special) are always excellent. Their yellowfin tuna was sashimi-grade, had a light sear on the outside, raw on the inside, so just an FYI if this is not your thing but my BF thought it was a wonderful dish. The waiters and waitresses really know the dishes and are helpful, but not pushy, while you select your dishes. I would definitely recommend a reservation, we usually just call ahead the day before or even the afternoon of and haven't had a problem getting a seat, but the restaurant does get crowded especially on weekends.",Tiffany W.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,6/24/14,"This place was a great find!  I stopped here while in Columbus for business.  Despite the overwhelming amount of favorable reviews this place has, I was a little skeptical at first because it was loosely connected to the back end of a mall. The restaurant is beautiful decorated and has tons of outdoor seating that overlooks the other shops in this area of Easton.  To paint a visual, this restaurant in feel is similar to other restaurants like Blue Pointe Grill, Del Frisco's, Capital Grille, etc.The place has a wide array of drinks that you can choose from on an IPAD.  I loved the options and was even more impressed by the staff's knowledge of the wines.  Besides, any place that sells Cakebread by the glass is more than A-OK in my book :-) For my entree, I tried the Blackened Snapper Oscar style with a half order of asparagus and potatoes.  I ordered way too much food so next time, I will only for one side (veggies, of course).  My meal was delicious!  The snapper was filleted, well seasoned, and cooked very nicely!  It came with a small scoop some corn goulash, which added a nice touch of sweetness to balance out the spice from the blackened seasoning.  Although I prefer my asparagus a little more crispy, both the asparagus and mashed potatoes were tasty and nicely complimented with a little accent of salt.I highly recommend checking this place out!  Enjoy!",Jamie S.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,6/28/14,"This is an odd pairing of fine dining and mall shopping.  The food is good. The service is impeccable. The value for money depends on your salary and attitude.  This is the same mall where you'll find a Tesla retailer.  If you think ""let's go to the mall to buy a $100,000 electric car,"" then this is the place for lunch.  If you think ""let's go the Costco at Easton to buy some new towels,"" check the menu at the door before being seated at a table.  Dinner for two, with salad, entree and drinks can easily run $100.  And the menu is modern with new takes on classic dishes, so be prepared for truffled champagne sauce,  jalapeÌ±o corn tartar, and brussel sprouts.Entrees (Chef's Compositions) run $26 to $49 on the dinner menu.  A salad starts at $9.  Steaks are a la carte, starting at $38.  Expect to pay $10 for a potato or other side.  Also expect the wait-staff to out-dress most patrons (this is a mall, after all) except on prom nights.  The staff avoids showing you that they cringe when diners arrive in t-shirts and cargo shorts (but they do).  They may even entertain you with a French accent just to make you feel more pedestrian.Easton is the right place for this restaurant, but it really should have its own building to avoid drawing in unsuspecting movie goers who looking for fish and chips or a burger, and grandmothers who offer to buy before realizing their social security will not pay for dinner *and* this month's rent.",John T.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,9/18/12,"Located at Easton Town Center, this place is very upscale in style, but you would still feel comfortable here in jeans  too.  They have a great drink menu with a lot of smart cocktails. I loved the Peach and Mango Fizz.Note, I just spent time in the bar, not the dining room. I loved the calamari and the tuna tacos... both were very fresh - a MUST for seafood, of course. The atmosphere was calm and posh. It would be a great spot for a first date, not too loud to talk, but enough activity around to foster conversation topics. The service was really great - I had just come from my hotel in a taxi and had my bag with me.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2003/12/14,"I'll make this review short and sweet. Elaboration on Ocean Club, a well-known and passionately revered Cameron Mitchell restaurant, is moot. I'll just echo predisposed reviews: the food made me weak in the knees, the wine sinfully savory, and the wait staff flawless. I'd love to get my hands on a Cameron Mitchell restaurant employee handbook for conduct, because every one of his restaurants is rife with knowledgable, eager staff who assuredly earn their tips. I tip my hat!We ordered the lobster ravioli, blackened snapper, and crab cakes. Make note: there are no bread crumbs in the crab cakes. Simply solid lump crab. And my, were they incredible. So delicious, that I only want to repeat my crab cake experience in no less than a year--a dish this good cannot be overdone in such a greedy, crabcakeinmymouth fashion. Sidenote 1: I appreciate that the hostess tells us when our table will be ready, rather than how long we will need to wait. ""Your table will be ready at 8:15"" sounds much less aggrieving than ""Your table should be ready in 50 minutes."" Right? Sidenote 2: The bathrooms are more glorious than any fancy pants hotel bathroom. What did you say? You forgot your lotion/q-tips/breathmints/feminine hygiene products? Well lucky for you, princess, Ocean Club has an array of fine products to spruce you up and beguile the men.You know what you're expecting in every Cameron Mitchell restaurant, and Ocean Club is no different. I'd argue this is my favorite of his line of fine dining experiences. If I didn't know better, I'd have thought Ocean Club was perched on a seaside pier, rather than amid the Easton Town Center.",Jessica D.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,6/20/12,"I love the Ocean Club. Been here before on several occasions and it's always exciting to go back. Had the opportunity to get some catch up time in last night with a colleague and we had a blast. We each had a salad (mine was the mozz/tomatoe special of the night) and hers was the chop chop salad.  We each got the 8 oz petite fillet medium and I had the mac n cheese truffle.  She got the jalapeno potatoes Au Gratin. Dessert turned out BETTER than expected. Creme Brulee for her and I asked for Carrot Cake at our server's recommendation.  I was brought Chocolate Cake (I know...oh darn!) and while I did not mind at all, was totally OK with it and NOT heart broken, our server insisted I get what I ordered and brought out Carrot Cake in ADDITION to the error Chocolate Cake. We asked for extra forks and we got to sample a little bit of everything so that turned out to be fun. Maria was more than gracious to box up the TWO cakes we had on our table - half slices each so each of us could take some home.  We get together roughly 1x a quarter and our last steak dinner night out was a disaster at another restaurant. This one confirmed our beliefs in the Ocean Club and reminded us once again we need to stick with the tried and true and go where it makes us happy.  Maria was an AMAZING server.

The service is amazing, even when it is a full house they are on top of it! Recommendations?-make reservations! Even on a weekday you can have over an hour way during peak hours. -Get the calamari for an app! It has a tangy Asian flavor to it that's phenomenal- looking for a side? Order the corn. It is not just your ordinary corn! It is so flavorful and has a tiny bit of a crunch to it. Very surprised by this sideChances are you will like whatever you order.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,9/16/13,"This is not Red Lobster and you will not receive cheddar biscuits.I was not aware how fancy this restaurant was when I organized a group of close friends to meet here for dinner and drinks on Friday. Thankfully, I had come from work and was still acceptably dressed for the occasion, although I felt dressed down in black slacks and a fashion knit top. I have been to the Columbus Fish Market and assumed it would be the same deal. Nope. But, nonetheless I had an incredible evening in spite of my expectations.Everything about the restaurant and experience can be summed up as ""fancy & classy."" This is the kind of place where you celebrate a promotion or ask someone to marry you. The waitstaff is painfully on cue to your every need, including the folding of your napkin while you are shown the rest room. Service was definitely 5 stars.The wine list was extensive. The vino guru at our table took it upon himself to order a bottle of red and a bottle of white to share. Between the 4 of us, we killed both bottles by night's end.Food was 5 stars as well. I had the ahi tuna and avocado as an appetizer and it was heavenly. For the main event, I ordered the scallops and they were seared to perfection. Our table of 4 did not opt to share a ""side"" which are large portions served family-style. About half my scallops atop garlic parmesan risotto came home in a doggy bag with me. Yes, it is quite expensive, but well worth it in my opinion. I hadn't seen these friends in awhile and we had such a nice time sharing stories and laughing that when the bill came, I didn't mind that it was much more than I usually spend on a night out. I had 5 star service, 5 star food and no regrets.",Emily B.,,,,,,

We had the raw oysters and the calamari as appetizers. I'm a big fan of raw oysters, but only if they're fresh and they were. The calamari didn't not come out breaded like I normally see them, which was a bit refreshing. The star of the meal was, of course, the Chilean sea bass, which I sampled from others' plates. The scallops I had were very tender and melt-in-your-mouth soft. The lobster was noted to be a little dry and not too extraordinary, so I would suggest skipping that. We even had a complimentary dessert. Everything was simply amazing.",Karyn M.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2009/1/13,"When it comes to rating restaurants of this caliber, I most definitely pull out my fine tooth comb, and look for every little thing that could be 'off'. Unless you regularly dine in Tokyo or London, this is a reasonably expensive restaurant. My nit picky comb has come up empty. Twice. The first time we came here, my wife and I were being recruited, and we didn't get the bill, but were very, very pleased with the overall experience.Tonight,  I took my father and family here for his 69th birthday. The food and service was simply beyond flawless. Attentive, helpful, deeply knowledgeable staff. The food. Wow. Look, I will admit it, my wife and I are sticklers. We love to cook, and I used to cook professionally. We don't dole out praises easily. All of the food was excellent. The calamari appetizer was great. Candied and mildly spicy, but neither the sweet or the hot covering up the delicate flavor of the squid. Nuts and crispy vegetables in the mix. My wife is a vegetarian, and hates oily, heavy dishes. She ordered off menu, and asked them to come up with a dish with pasta and vegetables. Our waitress took the time to ask the right questions, and what came out was great. 3 (myself included) in our party ordered filet mignon. We each got different preparations, and we all loved our steak. I got the blue cheese topping, and.....I.....sorry, getting a bit misty here. Holy heck was it good. We ordered 2 potato dishes to share with our main courses. I LOVE this aspect of their menu design. You are in a top shelf place, but they wisely tell you that the sides are large and to be shared. It takes the edge off what could be a stiff experience for all, and creates a great table environment. The people running Mitchells OC deeply understand what makes great food great, and understand what excellent service looks like. They are not just going through the motions, this is the real deal. Flying someone in from Beijing or Berlin for a meeting? I would take them here without reservation.",Josh H.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,8/22/13,"I grew up in the area but moved to Los Angeles many years ago, so whenever I'm in town my sister and her husband like to take us out to their favorite restaurants.  Being that it was our anniversary they decided on the Ocean Club!   Wow!!!   As luck would have it the weather was dreary and rainy so we opted to sit outside on the covered balcony since we don't get to enjoy a lot of dark rainy days in SoCal.  It was so relaxing to sit and listen to the light rain while we ate dinner and so exhilarating to see the flash of white light and hear the crack of thunder seconds later!  Everything we ordered was spectacular!  The wine, oysters, steak, salmon, side dishes and dessert were delicious.  We tasted each others dinners and remarked on how good each entree was.Since it was our anniversary our waiter surprised us with dessert.  We all looked at each other exclaiming how full we were until we tasted dessert then we fought over it!  I can't even remember what it was since we ate it so fast!  The bubbling martini's with dry ice were an exceptionally nice touch.  Going to make those at home.Our waiter was very professional but once he realized we were there to party he let loose and had us all laughing with his off the wall comments. I cannot wait to go back to Columbus again.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,2009/3/13,"I hadn't been to Ocean Club in a few years, so when my husband suggested that we come here for our sixth wedding anniversary dinner, I said OK.  And, after our dinner, I remembered why we don't really come here: It's not worth the money.Now, the drinks are great.  Pricey, but I'll spend a little money on a nice handcrafted cocktail.  I tried the Passion Martini, the Berries and Bubbles, and the Grapefruit Pear Martini (for the record, I wasn't driving).  The cocktails were top notch.Our server was OK, but not great.  I think that he was trying to be nice and give us a a leisurely dinner, but when it was 20 minutes into the meal and we hadn't yet ordered dinner and still had menus sitting on the table, I got a little impatient.  For starters my husband had a Caesar salad and I had the oysters, which were nice, but had some shells in them.  If you have oysters on your menu, you should learn to properly shuck them and clean out the shells.  But I digress.  For dinner, I ordered the Chilean sea bass.  Now, I eat at a lot of Cameron Mitchell restaurants because I have food allergies and they are very allergy friendly.  When I ordered the dinner, I asked the server if they could please substitute the sides for something that I could eat (plain asparagus, a baked potato, etc.).  The server said it would be no problem, so I pleasantly looked forward to our dinner.  However, when my dinner arrived, I was handed a plate with one piece of fish, 6 small carrot shavings, and 12 (yes, literally 12) peas.  And that was it.  For $43.  Um, WHAT?  My fish was cooked beautifully, but I was pretty bothered that they couldn't or wouldn't make me some sides to eat.I should have said something to the server, but at that point I was so annoyed by the people in the restaurant who were really loud and the table seated next to us dressed really inappropriately and talking on their constantly loudly ringing cell phone.  I honestly just wanted to get out of there.  They did give us a free dessert for our anniversary, but I could only eat the sorbet, which was clearly not fresh and had some freezer burn on it.So, in closing, if you are looking for a really nice, romantic dinner, I'd suggest going elsewhere.  I'm giving this place 3 stars because my fish was cooked beautifully and the cocktails were fantastic.  But, we spent $240 and they couldn't even throw a freaking baked potato on my plate.  Nope - I think we'll just sit at the bar next time.",Kate Q.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2005/2/14,"It's been a while, so please don't fault me.  We met the chef (!) after the meal by insistence of our waiter who learned we were leaving the next day for the Seattle area moving to Eugene.  What this has to do with anything is their ability to cook good fish (and it takes someone like this chef who had been trained in Seattle to filet, shuck and deal with fish for 10 years to get how amazed we were at the quality of Mitchell's Ocean Clubs food seafood; I am originally from Seattle).  The food was outstanding.  I don't know if they still serve the Truffle Mac and Cheese, but for a side dish, I will tell you, MADE our 3,000 mile journey and hassles a bit sweeter.  Try this dish if they still have it.  As people have waxed poetically about the calamari, this was our favorite as well.  The place is beautiful, wait staff is attentive but not intrusive (were they want to take your plate ever 5 minutes), and as Jonathan pointed out, don't be put off by it being in a mall setting, because the view, the food, and the staff more than make up for the overall mall business (not real fond of the internal part of the mall, but love the external beauty of the area, its calming and well done).Cameron Mitchell does a stellar job on this location.  I only wish we had gotten caviar, but that was not in our budget at the time, and with a quick reservation there also wasn't time to have set that up (usually caviar takes a couple day's reserve for most restaurant's to have it available if it isn't normally on the menu).  Would we go back?  In a Columbus minute!",Mary M.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,7/16/14,"We ate here over the weekend. Started out with possibly the largest Bluepoint oysters I have ever seen, were just delicious. Everyone shared their entree because they were so good. The butterflied Filet mignon was perfectly cooked, the scallops melted like butter in your mouth, and very clean not gritty, and the halibut was tender. Amazing food all around.Side dishes were fairly good. Twice baked potato was great, the only mediocre item at our table the entire evening was the asparagus spears. They shave off the skin, which is what a lot of fancy restaurants do, and they tasted okay, just not the best I have ever had.We sure picked a great night, not at all on purpose, because every bottle of wine under $100 was half off. So we took advantage of that. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs, even though she had a number of tables to attend to, and she even gave us a free desert, which was if a pound cake had made sweet love to a custard, with fresh fruit on top.We met the chef, who is a young kid who has been the head chef at this location for all of three months. Everything they prepared was spot on, and they had no problem substituting different sides or sauces that came with our entrees.We spent a lot and left our waitress a ample tip, and our appetites behind, very happy to have found this great place. I will return for sure the next time in Easton.",Ken E.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2004/11/15,"What here on last night and this place is excellent, pricey but we'll worth it.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,7/16/13,"Coming from NYC on a business trip to Columbus, Ohio you don't expect to find a huge variety of good food places. I saw this on the top of the list and walking distance from the hotel we were staying at. Not to mention this restaurant is located at the heart of the main shopping center. We had gone in with 5 people on a Monday night at 9pm..Definitely not crowded. This place was quite fancy- asked us if we wanted sparkling, still FIJI, or just tap water. (that's when you know) and of course the wine list. An assortment of breads (sourdoughs and pretzel breads) were provided.I ordered the 10 oz Filet Mignon Medium Rare- I have to say solid choice. Met my cravings and exceeded my expectations. We ordered a lot of sides to compliment our meals (truffle fries, black truffle mac and cheese, snap pees, baked potato) Everyone who ordered steak was satisfied. My manager ordered the Sea Bass and Halibut but was slightly disappointed. We probably would have ordered dessert, but the service took quite while to bring the food out. So my only complaint is that the service was quite slow. But the steak was solid.",Amy C.,,,,,,

The best side is easily the creamed corn, the best of any I've had at any steakhouse anywhere. I love the oysters Rockefeller and calamari to start. The real reason I'm writing this review has nothing to do with the amazing food and service other Yelpers have already elaborated on... The Black Orchid. The greatest martini there ever was.

My entree was the chilean sea bass with whipped potatoes and champagne truffel sauce, cooked absolutely perfect. I also had a taste of the pork porterhouse that a family member ordered, and it was very good. I finished with the baked alaska which was definitely the best dessert I've had in a restaurant. Also got a taste of the creme brulee and the peanut butter pie. It is extremely expensive but definitely worth the splurge. Definitely a night where you will not be disappointed.",Lindsey T.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2005/9/15,"Great Mother's Day Eve at Ocean Club!  Wife had surf & turf with Black Orchid cocktail - all phenomenal.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,10/24/13,"The food was outstanding, and I'm not here to write that, coz it will just echo the same thing that everybody have already said. I'm here to propose different things on the menu, and going against what everybody seems to have a consensus on :). I believe, if you choose mine over the crowd, you will not be disappointed. 1. Leave the truffle mac n cheese, it's good, but it's just a mac n cheese in the end. You can't bring much finesse on something so simple I think2. Try the carrot cake, instead of the baked alaska that everybody are raving about. It was good, but the carrot cake was more phenomenal. Baked Alasa, in the end, is just an ice cream (although kudos to the meringue and berry sauce)",Gerry J.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,2/23/15,Second visit to Mitchell's did not disappoint.  Pretty crowded for a frigid Tuesday night so this place must definitely have some draw.  Sampled a few apps..all very good....just not very memorable. The entrÌ©e was a different story. The blackened snapper was outstanding.  Server called it his favorite and I can see why.  My dining counterpart had the 10 oz. filet.  The best kept secret about this place is the STEAKS.  I had the ribeye last time and the filet this time was equally amazing.  Mitchell's LAND Catch might not have much of a ring to it but the beef was as good or better than any high end steak chain.  Great wine selection supports the meal. A Central Coast Cab did nicely.  This place stays front and center on my Columbus (Easton) dining options.,Mark S.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2009/9/16,"All the hype and then some! From the moment you walk in the door the experience starts. Friendly hosts welcome you with seemingly sincere smiles and usher you to your table. My preference of a window seat was quickly accommodated, and dining staff cleared excess settings promptly. My waiter was everything you'd expect at this caliber of establishment- knowledgeable, professional, and courteous. He checked in often and the team effort was commendable as multiple waiters checked in and refilled drinks and cleared dishes away while my waiter attended to other tables needs. The dinner was spot on. My lobster bisque appetizer is easily in the cities top two, and the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes stole the show. One would not expect such fine seafood in the middle of the mid west but here it is. Ocean Club easily rivals any coastal restaurant I've eaten at. Though a bit on the pricier end in Columbus I actually found it quite fair, especially when you take into consideration that they are flying most of their menu in for freshness combined with their location at Easton. Certainly worth it and I recommend to anyone.",William P.,,,,,,

Favorite = the Cucumber Gimlet.  The only thing I *will* say is that the cocktails are EXPENSIVE.

Our sides were perfect--the corn was amazing, the sugar snap peas were delicious.  Dessert was huge and rich, far too decadent not to be shared.  The wine list is excellent.  Service is superb.  The miss on the fifth star is only due to the fact that they were out of several entrees.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,12/18/15,"I decided to sit at the bar to order dinner. The guy at the bar, Server 451 said the receipt, asked me once I sat down what I would like to drink. I asked for water, thinking I would look over the menu and decided which wine I would like with my dinner. Later on nearly 5 minutes of waiting I had to ask for a menu. I was given a food menu only, so I still didn't know which wine I was going to prefer with my dinner. Subsequently approximately 10 more minutes he came over and inquired if I was ready to order. I still needed a wine list, then after inquiring for one I was handed on a tablet to view my selection.  I did notice the bartenders were not too busy to serve the person sitting two seats down from me. This person came in after I did, had water, a drink and had already placed their order... all before I was given a food menu.The service was subpar and I felt that I was not getting the level of service this restaurant commands. After getting past the lack of service, my dinner ended up being excellent.",Steve S.,,,,,,

Whatever you want they do, and whatever they do is perfect.The menu is varied enough that you can get fish, seafood, red meat, poultry, pork.Everything is alacart.  Salads and sides are large, so share.Large list of craft drinks.  They have a large wine menu and also a ""super"" wine menu.  Markups probably approach the obscene level, but offerings I have had were all exceptional.Service is top-notch.If you want to be in a crowd, front room is good.  They do a great HappyHour too.  If you want quiet or romantic, ask for the back room.They have valet parking or you can park wherever in The MallWe spent 125$ for two.  No bottles of wine this time.Prefect.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,6/23/13,"3.5 out of 5 stars.Relative to the price, it would not be unreasonable to expect perfection or something close to it. Ocean Club does a decent job but doesn't quite nail the perfection.The seafood sampler was top notch. The wine selection and whiskey selection were on par with expectations. The calamari was great -- spicy and not rubbery.Now for the problems:Within our group, one person received the wrong entree. To their credit, they fixed it very quickly and then comped us a dessert. While anybody is entitled to a mistake, it is a bit awkward to have to wait for that person or eat while they wait.The steak (which seems to be their specialty despite the name Ocean Club) is promised as seared at 1200 degrees. There is no doubt that it is but the result is Pittsburgh Rare rather than something more traditional.Service was slow. Despite being a table of 10, there were several times when we had to search and flag down our waiter. I could see this during the middle of the meal but after you've served dessert, it should not be a surprise that the table may want the check.Overall, it's a decent experience. It's just not a 5 star experience.",Derek C.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,10/25/12,"Hands down, one of my favorite seafood restaurants in Columbus. What I love about it, besides the food/drink, are the great staff and ambience. The crowd is always lively, and while the atmosphere feels decidedly upscale, there is nothing pretentious about this place.The food is excellent. I recommend the Colossal Shrimp SautÌ©, Truffle Mac and Cheese, JalapeÌ±o Gratin, and the Chilean Sea Bass. The drinks are inventive, and the presentation is always lovely (go for the Black Orchid which is not only delicious but adorable).If you still have room, the desserts are sublime.

We wandered in and had no idea: we got lucky!Food: most everything we ordered was pretty amazing.  You can't leave without trying the rare ahi tuna appetizer, it was my favorite thing.  My husband said the filet was perfect, and the scallops and risotto were delicious too.  (Although I did enjoy the scallops at the Refectory a bit more.. Sorry!)The sides are a la carte, but are really big.  If you are a couple, ask for a half-size of the sides.  We got the mashed potatoes and truffle macaroni.  (I didn't like the macaroni -- it tasted a lot like Velveeta.)  We skipped dessert but the table next to us got a HUGE Baked Alaska to share and it looked pretty delicious.Service: super great.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2006/3/12,"Easily one of the best meals I've ever had!I narrowed my choice down to two entrees, so asked the server which was better and with no hesitation she said the scallops.  So I ordered that.  The wife ordered the jumbo crab cake appetizer as her meal based on it being singled out on the menu as their ""Signature Appetizer"" (and that she loves crab cakes).  We also ordered a baked potato and ""chophouse corn"" as sides.When the food came out it took a lot of rearranging of things to make everything fit on the table, we were with another couple.  The sides are quite large, way more than what one person could handle.  The fact that each side dish feeds 2-3 people helps keep the cost down as they are pricey.  My scallops looked fantastic and tasted ever better.  There were four and they were very large, seared beautifully on both sides.  But the risotto which is part of the dish really upped the the scallops to another level!  They were incredible.The baked potato was just good, but the corn was great.  The server had described the corn as special, I believe that it arrives fresh every day and is cut off the cob.  Butter and spices are added but it was truly special.  Her describing it to us is what prompted me to order it.The service was very professional and good, and I think the key to our experience was using the servers (Jen) ability in our selection of food.  My entree and the side of corn were they two things she guided us to, and the wife's crab cake was high lighted on the menu as being special, and these three things were simply amazing.It isn't cheap, but it was certainly worth what we paid for it!About the only thing that was a negative was that we were seated in the middle of the main area and it was loud there.  Next time there we will ask to avoid being seated in that part, but even if we had to sit there, that certainly wouldn't deter us from a meal here.An all around amazing dining experience!",Hank's Dad R.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2/20/12,"I would highly recommend a reservation - we came here at 8p (one hour til closing) on a Sunday and they were packed!  Sunday IS half priced wine bottle day, though...so that may explain the business.  Nevertheless, we were happy we had a reservation.Take the opportunity to dress up and you won't be out of place here.  Very classy ambiance, the serving staff is great - very professional and friendly, and decked out in white tuxes.There is valet parking ($5) or you can park at the meter or one of the garages, but it's a bit of a walk if you're not lucky.  Just be aware while you're rockin' those high heels.  At 8p we found a meter right across the street.We tried the full contigent of app, entree, desserts and drinks and everything was great.Drink - just me, hubby doesn't drink.  The Black Orchid.  It comes with an orchid encased in ice and they pour the martini right at your table, all the way to the top so you can't even lift the drink it's so full.  Don't be afraid of looking like an idiot sipping your drink from the table - it's THAT GOOD.  Man was it good.  Honestly one of the best martini's I've ever had.  Tasted like it had no alcohol whatsoever in it.  Lest you think the bartender just made us a weak drink, I was feeling it after just the one, so that wasn't the case.Apps - truffle deviled eggs and oysters rockefeller.  The deviled eggs may look strange to you, but we love deviled eggs and these were really fantastic.  It's harder than you think to make a really excellent egg - they are very easy to overcook.  But these were perfect and had a nice zing.  The oysters...well, we have had better, but I will say these were the best oysters we've had in a landlocked state.  They were still pretty nice.  You won't find much better unless you're at the coast.Entrees: I went with the twin lobster tails, hubby had the ribeye.  The lobster was cooked nicely with a yummy spice on top, and I liked their little butter warmer with a candle.  Hubby's steak was EXCELLENT.  It had a fantastic char on the outside, just like it should, and was perfectly cooked to medium rare.  I am always a little wary of getting steaks at a predominantly seafood place, but this ribeye rocked!We got the truffle mac and cheese for the side (yes, they love truffling everything) and it too was excellent - highly recommended and worth the price.Desserts - they were out of the baked Alaska and PB pie.  Hubs got the carrot cake and I got the creme brulee.  Both were HUGE.  I'm not a huge fan of carrot cake but I liked it with the pineapple puree sauce they had...the creme brulee, for me, was the only thing that wasn't fantastic.  The crust was a bit too thick.For all that, $150 minus tip.  So it's not cheap.  But it is a great romantic dinner and you'll enjoy the food if you go into it understanding how much you'll be dropping on dinner.",Caerleigh T.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,7/22/11,"I've been to Ocean Club twice now, and both times it was a great experience. It is kind of odd that it's smack dab in the Easton mall but once you go inside the restaurant, you almost forget all about that. The service is so above and beyond that I cannot think of anywhere else I have had better attention. The first time I went, it was just because. It was kind of annoying that everyone from the hostess to our waitress and even the manager kept asking us what we were celebrating when there was no celebration, but I guess it's understandable that 90% of people there are celebrating something. To be fair, the second time I went it was for my birthday and it was actually really nice to have everyone (from the hostess to our waiter to the manager) tell me happy birthday!Both times I got the black orchid cocktail and both times I loved it. Girly and smooth, with a cool looking ice cube (a flower petal frozen in the ball of ice!). Both times my date got the 10 oz filet mignon cooked medium. The first time it was cooked to PER-FEC-TION. Literally every single bite he took he was raving, almost to the point where I was annoyed. But I tried some and it was indeed perfect. We agreed you get what you pay for. Second time around was still good, but the first steak still takes the cake. Maybe we were just coming in with irrationally high expectations the second time. I went outside of my comfort box on my second visit and ordered the chilean sea bass. I have nothing to compare it to since I never had it before and don't really know the fish, but it was fine. The truffle sauce was creamy and yummy with it - I almost enjoyed the sauce more than the fish. We split a side of brown sugar carrots but were honestly so full from the bread and our dishes that we couldn't finish them. On my birthday I got a free dessert and the chocolate cake was the winner. 7 layers of fluffy chocolate that was not too sugary, and almost more bitter like dark chocolate. Perfect for me.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,12/26/11,"I've enjoyed several of Cameron Mithcell's restaurants but for some reason I had never made it to Ocean Club. So when I was back for Christmas and staying next to Easton, I thought this was the perfect opportunity.The whole place has a kind of a ""rat pack; 50's vibe"" to it and I like that. Staff is all in white coats and a piano player was singing holiday tunes. Menu is obviously big on seafood but also lists an extensive steak selection. We started with the crab cake which was awesome. Probably the best I've had. Since my brother in law had mentioned he had one of the best steaks ever here, I decided to give the filet a try, as did my partner. We both enjoyed it however my partner would have liked it pushing ""medium"" a bit more. I thought mine was perfect.  As for the sides, this is where Ocean Club took a bit of a tumble. It wasn't the quality or taste of the baked potato side dish, it was that it was SOOO freakin' big! Yes, our sever told us the sides serve 2-4 people but nothing can prepare you for the Nerf football sized baked potato they bring out. And the the thing was so hot you couldn't touch it (never mind eat it) until you were 3/4 of the way done with your steak.  It just seemed odd compared to the well thought out dishes we had previously.Great seafood and steak place but unless you have 5 people with you, skip the sides.",Steve S.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,1/17/14,Just about perfect!  Our server was one of the best we have ever had anywhere!! His recommendations were spot-on.

The place is first class and the service is excellent. Attractive dark wood decor and white table clothes.  You wouldn't think that such a fine restaurant would be on the  top floor of a shopping mall or that the food could be this good--but it is!We expected casual after-shopping diners and spotty attire.  Instead, it seemed to us that most of the patrons on this busy Saturday night were pretty nicely dressed and it appeared that they came to Eaton Town Center specifically to dine at Mitchell's.  And for good reason. The food and service were tremendous.  After a short wait at the extremely busy bar, we were seated at a quieter table next to a window.  Our server was courteous and knowlegeable.  He pointed out that the large sides could be shared and he even brought us a half order of one of them.  My wife had the sea bass with truffle sauce and it lived up to the other awesome reviews on this site.  I had the porterhouse which was broiled to a perfect medium rare and melted in your mouth.  Elegant!    And, don't forget desert--if you stop at the Easton Town Mall info center on the ground floor of the mall, they will give you a book of discount coupons.   Use the free desert coupon at Mitchell's to get the Baked Alaska....not the best of I've had, but very good nonetheless.  They have several other good desert choices.This is a better restaurant and the prices reflect that quality.  I don't think the portions were too small, in fact, we both took some home to our hotel to enjoy the next day!  We enjoyed our experience and we'll definitely be back.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,7/31/12,"Classic fine dining done quite well.THE FOODWe had;- The Tomato Mozzarella salad; outstanding. The ingredients were first rate and the composition was not overdone at all.- The Pork Chop; outstanding. The server recommended it medium, and he was spot on.- The Petit Filet, very very nice. The server recommended no more than medium and it was again just right. The peppercorn sauce was the weakness, I'd guess corn starch was the culprit.- The Black truffle Mac+Cheese, Button mushrooms and Creamed spinach were all very well done as well.- The wine and port pairings recommended by the server were perfect. - The Carrot cake was the best we'd ever had and the Creme Brulee was excellent.- All for about $150 not including tip, and the desserts were free due to it being our anniversary.THE SERVICEVery very attentive, knowledgeable and accommodating - maybe a bit too syrupy though. Later I realized some of the lines that were intended to be charming were rehearsed and were being repeated verbatum to every other table - and we thought we were special ;-)   But I would rather the service err on the side of it being overdone. He even offered to run down and put in more coins in the meter, we were definitely being pampered.THE ATMOSPHERESupper club decor and nicely done. The balcony was nice, even though the view is of the monstrosity called Easton. Some thoughtful touches, like a shade on part of the balcony to prevent the setting sun from being an irritant. But then some fans on the balcony would have really made it more comfortable. On the negative, the bathroom floors were sticky and there was splatter all around the urinal for the entire 2.5 hours we were there.All in all, I will repeat and recommend.

When we arrived the restaurant was full, thankfully we had made reservations in advance and had a table waiting for us.  Our server was promptly over to discuss the menu and wine selection with us.  She managed to talk us into a bottle Treana (although my goal was to limit my drinking...).  It was absolutely delicious, she had her flavors down and knew every question I threw at her.Our meal began with the goat cheese ravioli, which was delicious.  Looking at the menu, I had to stop myself from ordering too many appetizers, but I'll definitely be returning to try the truffle deviled eggs.  I went on to order the Chilean Sea Bass with champagne truffle sauce.  So delicious!  Maybe I just love truffles, but I think this dish was prepared beautifully.  My friend ordered the Ginger Salmon and both of us were very pleased with how it tasted (especially since I had it for lunch the next day).  The waitress was sure to point out that the side dishes come separately, so we had a serious debate over which to order.  Although tempted by the truffle mac, we settled on the scallion twice baked potato that was highlighted on the menu.  This was the only part of the meal that wasn't spectacular.  Don't get me wrong, it tasted good, but I'm sure I could have ordered something similar elsewhere.  Next time I'll be more adventurous with my side selection.And then there was dessert.  Oh dear goodness, I'm so glad I didn't skip this part of the evening.  Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie, I love you so!  This dish was simply amazing.  I would come back to the Ocean Club just to devour this over and over again.Yes, this restaurant is a pretty penny.  I won't be coming here for just any dinner, but for special occasions (especially romantic) it is a lovely choice.",Michelle K.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,2001/1/14,"Expensive as all get out, but delicious.  I did have to send my steak back though due to being under cooked and the sides do not come with your meal which is a total crock given how much you're paying. The deserts were phenomenal though.  The service was good but it was way too noisy.  I had to almost be yelling across the table just so my husband could hear me.  And the tables are so cramped and close together so that you can't help but be a part of the neighboring table's conversation.  For as expensive as it was you'd think the experience would be better.  It should be impeccable for a $250 tab for only two people.",Julia E.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,5/13/11,"I went to the Ocean Club on a weeknight to celebrate a friend'sbirthday.  We had a reservation and were taken to our table right away.We ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and a filet cooked medium rare alongwith the jalapeno cheddar potatoes.  The bread isn't bad - nothingspectacular though, pretzel sticks and a circle sourdough loaf...wouldprobably be better if they had a specialty butter or cheese dippingsauce.  After we ordered I decided to peruse the wine list -- to mysurprise, they had a $6 glass of wine, which was a bonus!!  I was verysurprised that they had budget wine.  So...the food.  Average at best.We did get a sample of the mac and cheese which was really delicious --I would go back for a full order of it, but, I'll leave the sea bass andfilet.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,2005/1/13,"I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars but one little nitnik pushes into the 4 star category.  That nitpik started the meal, so it took some recovery.  Anyway, we went on a Sunday night for our anniversary and the restaurant wasn't very crowded.  However, when the hostess went to seat us she sat us right next to the kitchen....like one of us would have to stare into the kitchen and at the computer where the servers are ringing people--a high traffic area.  Given that there were a plethora of other seating options, we asked to be reseated.  A server approached us and told us we could have our pick.  We should have listened and seated ourselves, but we let the hostess re-seat us......RIGHT NEXT TO THE KITCHEN!  This time it was against a wall with a window looking into the kitchen, so less traffic but still quite noisy.  I felt like the right thing to do would be to seat us as far as possible from the kitchen since there were plenty of seats. However, that was really the most annoying thing about dinner.That being said, once we were seated our waiter (who was the one who approached us earlier) was wonderful.  It was 50% bottles so we decided to get a Willamette Valley Pinot Noir and he told us a little about the three choices so help us make our decision.  I hate when waitstaff don't know the wine list, so this earned him points in my book. Later in the meal he also suggested a port to my husband who was deciding which to have as well. I had the oysters, snapper, and blueberry lemon cheesecake and my husband had the crabcake appetizer, filet mignon with bernaise sauce and the chocolate cake.  We split the stuffed potato.  The food was all good with the steak being a standout.  My husband said it was the best steak he's ever had, my snapper was excellent--hot and delicious but not overcooked.  I am from Florida and am usually deeply opposed to paying $3/oyster when I grew up paying .25/oyster but these were very good.  The potato was probably the one thing I felt like was 1) probably not necessary given we were unable to finish dessert and 2) truly overpriced in a restaurant where we knew we were going to drop some cash.Desserts were both delicious and tasted very fresh.  Overall it was really nice, excellent and unobtrusive service, really stellar food and other than the seating thing a great meal.",Morgan M.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,10/16/13,"Mitchell's restaurants always feature really good, quality food.  The ambiance is great - good for a date or to bring a couple business partners.  Geared toward seafood, but their steaks are what I would suggest.  It is expensive but not uncommonly so for the quality and atmosphere. This is a place that I will be back to for sure, but probably not a place I would be a regular at.  Columbus fish market has the same quality for less money.",Tim S.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,1/18/14,My cousins and I went here for my birthday. The food was really good. the waiter - amazing. We felt as if he had practiced his lines he was just that good. Even though I wasn't allowed to pay - this place is pricey so just be prepared and do dress up! Even though we were 10 minutes late for our reservations at 10:30 pm they were still excellent as far as being nice about it and even though they close at 11 pm there were still people there so it was nice. We order shrimp scampi for appetizers as well as calamari and for dinner I had the Chilean sea bass with a side of mashed potatoes - SO good!  I would definitely recommend this place to others.,Samreen H.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,7/14/11,"My husband and I went to the Ocean Club for our anniversary. This was our first time there and it didn't fail to impress in both quality of food and service. Although it's attached to Easton, it does not have that cheap-eating-in-a-mall feel at all. The decor reminded me of what the interior of a yacht might be like and was very pleasant. At 6pm on a Wed it wasn't crowded at all but soon filled up - with some rather loud business folks and other C-bus yuppies -within an hour. Despite that, we enjoyed our meal. Is it the best fine dining in Columbus? No. I mean the surf and turf appetizer was glorified pot roast with mashed potatoes and 2 scallops. But it was very good nonetheless. I'd definitely recommend Ocean Club and I especially liked that their portions were of high quality and a normal serving size, not the gross, overblown servings at nearly every other place at Easton.",Donna L.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2001/8/15,"I get something different every time and have never been disappointed.  Some tips: 1. If your address is at least 50 miles away, the Easton Mall will give you a booklet with coupons.  There is a free Mitchell's dessert in there.  I recommended the carrot cake or peanut butter dishes.2. The calamari - so stinkin' good.  It is NOT merely battered and served with two sauces. 3. The sides are SO BIG.  TOO BIG.  We aren't from Columbus, so we never can keep our leftovers.  We found out this last visit that you can get half sides.  STILL HUGE.  Saves you money and you can try more things.4. They bend over backwards for you if it is your anniversary or they mess up something.  I once ordered a medium steak, and it was well done.  I had been eating it for 15 minutes (it was still good, and I don't like to send things back).  When our waiter saw it (that there was no pink within the meat), he was so disappointed that I had not complained, and he insisted on getting me a new one and ordering me a cocktail on the house while I waited.  That's service, people.5. Speaking of cocktails, get the black orchid.    We will be back next an anniversary.  No doubt about it!",Rachel M.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,9/22/10,"What would it take for me compose a rave review of a seafood restaurant?  Before my first dining experience at Mitchell's Ocean Club Restaurant, I'd have confidently answered ""NEVER.""I have a profound aversion to seafood, so nuttily encompassing that I cannot contemplate swallowing anything which considers under the water's surface to be ""home.""  And if I discover having just eaten mashed potatoes prepared with, say, anchovy extract:  well, then, my dinner companion will be spending the next 20 minutes alone as I projectile-vomit, hopefully in a toilet stall and not at the table!  Bonkers?...no argument from me.  But not worth the $5000. fee to have a psychologist therapize it to non-existence.So it should be no surprise that seafood restaurants aren't a favorite.  Perversely, wouldn't you predict that my aversion might interfere with me regarding a seafood establishment as a favorite?When I decided to take my boyfriend for seafood on his birthday (his favorite), I took him to Cameron Mitchell's Ocean Club, I was blown away!  The menu assumes that not every guest wants fish or seafood, and so there is a significant section of alternative options.  From many subsequent meals there, I can say with confidence that the chefs are skilled in excellent food preparation beyond their obvious cuisine of expertise.This restaurant distinguishes itself by the fact there are no fishy aromas...ever!  The waiters and ..tresses are knowledgeable and willing to take steps "" above and beyond"" to make the experience perfection as the guest sees it.  Not cheap, it isn't intended to be a routine dining destination but it has become my ""dress-up dinner destination."".                     Six Stars!!",John D.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,2011/2/10,"Let's start out by saying I prefer not to dine in ""mall"" restaurants... But, we thought we would give it a shot since we wanted to avoid downtown on Halloween weekend.The food we had was great! The signature appetizer crab cake was really good and big enough to split... I ordered salmon and my fellow diner ordered the scallops... We got 2 sides to split... the asparagus and wild rice... Not sure how they did it, but, the asparagus was the best I have ever tasted...  Didn't know you could really change up asparagus... but, they did. My salmon was excellent... perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth good. I didn't try the scallops because I have a bad history with them. The portions were large enough we had left overs. The ambiance... is... OK. We were seated kind of in the middle of a larger room surrounded by tables... We probably should have requested a booth. I felt like I could hear everything the tables around us were discussing... and since I have a tendency to listen to other people's conversations... I found that kind of distracting and hard to ignore. The service was pretty good...

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,2,2006/3/12,"Easily one of the biggest dissappointments I've ever had!We dined with another couple who gave it 5 stars, so it shows how different each person's opinion can be.  If Yelp allowed 1/2 stars (will this ever happen?  They show partial stars on the review averages), I would give it a 2 1/2. Upon entering, it is very appealing visually as it is a classy establishment located in a mall, of all places.  After we sat down, the noise was totally overwhelming.  The acoustics in this place are horrible - easily the loudest place I have ever dined at (and that includes Red Robin with its population of loud screaming children and a place in Maumee, OH which has live music).  Within minutes, I had a throbbing headache from the clatter.  I could hear approximately 15% of what our server was explaining about the menu and specials.  This was not a good start to our experience so it would really have to knock our socks off to make up for that.  Good luck trying to converse with your dining companions without yelling.A basket was delivered to the table which consisted of warm bread and soft pretzel sticks.  I bit into the pretzel stick and it was so salty that I immediately placed it back on my plate (and I enjoy salt).  The other bread was fine.I ordered the appetizer surf & turf, which consisted of 2 large scallops and braised short rib on mashed potatoes.  My wife ordered the house salad.  We also ordered the candied yams and jalapeno potato au gratin sides.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and not fishy at all, but void of flavor - they needed some lemon juice or a sauce on them.  The shredded short rib was very good but a small portion.  I know it was only an appetizer, but I expected more for $15 when I can go to a nice restaurant in Toledo and pay the same for a full meal that comes with a large salad and have a much more satisfying experience.  My wife's salad was ordinary - it was supposed to have apple in it but she said there were only 3 small, thin slices.  The sides were nowhere near as large as the server claimed, since they were supposedly big enough to share between 2-3 people (especially since a previous Yelp review claimed the baked potato to be a Nerf football sized).  This appears to be an urban legend akin to the existence of Bigfoot or that Elvis is still alive.  Since they were average sides, perhaps it was to our advantage they weren't larger.  I can get a far superior version of yams in the form of a sweet potato souffle for much cheaper from either my wife's homemade version or Boston Market, both of which include the contrasting texture and added flavor of a streusel topping.  Mitchell's was basically candied yams with some large marshmallows melted on top.  I only had a small sample of the jalapeno potato au gratin (their ""signature"" side), but it did not make an impression one way or the other.  Another letdown considering the sides range from $8-$10 each.Caveot emptor (buyer beware) is my warning because sides are not included with the entrees, which range from $24 to $45.  In fact, the average price of the 17 entrees listed is $35.18.  Add sides and drinks to that and you will have a hefty bill for average food and an average experience.  When dining at a restaurant of this calibre, I expect the highest quality, taste and service - I want to be wowed.  It should rock my world or be a life-changing event.  This was not that type of experience at all.  Our bill was $50 prior to tip for an appetizer, salad, two sides and one soft drink.The service was average at best.  The server checked on us once after our food first arrived to see how it was.  Perhaps it was because we were low priority since we didn't order full entrees and alcoholic beverages so the tip would not be as large as surrounding tables.There are so many other wonderful and unique places in the Columbus area to have more flavorful food and a better dining experience than in the corporate setting of the Easton Center mall.  And you can visit them 2-4 times for the price of one visit to Mitchell's.  I doubt we will ever go back or visit any of the other related establishments.  WAY overpriced and overrated!",Sabrina G.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2003/5/13,"I wanted to rave about my New Year's Eve experience a few months ago at Ocean Club. We were a party of four who had booked a reservation some time in advance for 9:00pm. As expected, they were packed that night and running behind. While we had expected that, we didn't expect a 45 minute wait for a table.However, Ocean Club addressed the situation before we even had time to say anything. When we were seated, they brought us out four complimentary appetizers and both the server and manager apologized for our wait. We would have been happy with one appetizer - four was a shock to our group. The appetizers were very good: the calamari, ravioli, cheese fondue, and another appetizer that I unfortunately cannot recall.Dinner itself was also fantastic. I had the ginger crusted salmon and enjoyed it. The rest of my party also enjoyed their meals, which ranged from steak to scallops. My date and I split the sauteed mushrooms for our side, and they were very well done. I snuck a taste of dessert from one of my party and it was the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. Had I not eaten so much for dinner, I would have ordered a piece for myself.We were eating dessert when the ball was about to drop, and to cap off a great service experience, the restaurant passed out party favors and complimentary glasses of champagne. My New Year's Eve exceeded expectations, and we would not have changed a thing!",Alexandra M.,,,,,,

I love the bar area and all the drinks are really fun and creative plus the truffle popcorn is to die for!  Four of us came for dinner on a Saturday night and the hostess was a little rude.  She asked if we wanted to sit outside noting our reservation requested it so I asked how hot it was, her response in a snotty voice, as hot as outside.  Well sorry I didn't know if they had fans or air conditioning in there since in the winter I thought they heated it. Whatever I can get over a snotty hostess.  Our waitress really wasn't all the much better although she wasn't rude just not friendly and we had to flag her down every time we wanted to order something and to get our check.  We came here expecting to order seafood and all four of us ordered steak bc nothing on the seafood menu was really jumping out at us.  Calamari for an app was good.  The steaks were good but nothing fantastic.  The sides were really good though, truffle mac and cheese was amazing and the jalapeno potatoes were great too and not spicy like I thought, just a little kick.  No room for dessert although I was very tempted but the peanut butter pie. Oh and FYI if you aren't sure how dressy the place is (we weren't sure whether the guys should wear pants or if shorts were ok)...some guy at the bar had a hat, t-shirt and jeans on and other people had suits & dresses on so it kind of varies, seems like anything goes since it's at a mall.I would probably come back and give this place one more shot bc I like the atmosphere and drinks but hopefully next time the service is better.",Erin K.,,,,,,

Ambiance was soft. Romantic atmosphere mostly. The guy playing the piano was just great. Georgia on my mind, sounded so good coming from him and it was just the perfect pitch not overbearing or too loud.Honestly, the food was good but I always had the impression from the name that they would beat out their fish market. I think I like the fish market better. They didn't wow me here. It was good but not worthy of five stars. I had the seared scallop entree and yes it was unique in its herbal bouquet finish and actually I thought the herbs were delicately tasteful crab cake appetizer was good and not too crispy and the corn was like a salad relish with no vinegar.

The service was excellent. Nate went above and beyond and was very accommodating with menu changes, wine recommendations, etc. We started with the shellfish tower, the shrimp cocktail and lump crab was the best I've ever had. The scallops I ordered for the main course were cooked to perfection along with the filet, cooked to a perfect medium. I recommend getting the filet oscar style, it is delicious! We also had the lobster mashed potatoes which were amazing. I've had them at M before and the lobster was tough, at the ocean club it was tender and they were so worth the $19!! Again, Nate was awesome and on point with the timing of apps, salads, entrees and wine pours. The next time we go back we would probably request him again!

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,10/18/14,"Have eaten here probably 40-50 times in the last 10 years. Has become my wife's and my favorite place in Columbus.Atmosphere - great set up and decor. Somewhat typical wood tones that most ""steakhouses"" utilize, but it looks classy and crisp. Remodel from the original years was a welcome change. The addition of the open patio that wraps around the restaurant is awesome... great view overlooking Easton and you can enjoy the sunsets in the evening. I believe they put heaters out there in the winter and it works great. Party/meeting room in back has good privacy, and the place has a good ""vibe"" when it is busy, but does not become overly loud.Bar/lounge/Drinks - Occasional live music which is nice. Good bar space with tv's covering good sporting events. High tops are first come/first serve and good place to sit and grab a drink/light bite. Bar staff is excellent... very friendly, attentive and enjoyable to eat dinner with. Take out/call ahead orders are flawless with the bar. Not a cocktail guy, but have heard that have some good/interesting options available. No draft beers, only bottle. Wine list and drink list are published on iPads with a great interface that is easy to use. Their wine prices are fair (for a restaurant) and they really have a nice selection across the board. Captains list has some interesting options... very good offerings considering the crap wine lists that seem to plague almost every restaurant these days. Good stemware.Service - well trained, friendly and attentive. Have never had average or rude service here. Similar to the bar staff, wait staff is great. Management always makes an effort to swing by and say hi.Food - Excellent. Best seafood in central Ohio by far. Bread basket always fresh and hot w/ mix of pretzel bread and mix loaf. Appetizers are great size and different than the typical boring offerings of most places. I recommend the Ahi Tuna, the Surf n' Turf (scallops, short ribs and mashed potatoes) and the sweet chili calamari. Lobster bisque is hands down best bisque I have tasted... they do not overuse the cognac... flavor mix is great. A la carte fish and steaks available. Steaks are all good, but seafood here is my preference. Snapper is a good option if you want a bit of spice, seabass is always good (cooked very well, simple dish); Twin tails are nicely flavorful, and the yellowtail is a good dish. For sides, the truffle mac n' cheese seems like it was reworked recently, and the change was great... excellent dish. The jalapeno au gratin are delicious, and the new tater tots with smoked gouda were delicious. Wish they would bring back the yams. Green sides are typical, kind of boring. Dessert is average... carrot cake is probably the best.Great location at Easton, can pair up with shopping or a movie. Cameron Mitchell's best restaurant by far. Highly recommend this spot. Reservations are a good idea, but it if you hit the place around 5 seating should be easy. Was there a few days ago on a Thursday and the place was PACKED all evening long.Price can get hefty very quickly. Steaks around $40, seafood about $30-35 on average.",Michael J.,,,,,,

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,5/21/12,Ocean Club is not just a place for seafood. Being this is a Mitchells restaurant you can get there aged to perfection steaks. On this visit I had the Ribeye and the truffle mac and cheese. Quite frankly both were the best I have had in a long time.,Kevin S.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,6/14/10,"Nice place. Great food, great drinks. EXPENSIVE though. Nice bar and friendly bartenders. I would recommend this place over Bar Louie or the silly place next door (which I can't remember the name of.)",mateo s.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,9/20/07,"Fantastic!Been here twice and have had excellent meals there.  The filet mignon was excellent and the martinis are highly recommended.Pricey, but definitely worth it for a special night out.",Vin R.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,5/20/13,Mitchell's Ocean Club was teriffic.  From the French Onion Soup to the amazing ginger Salmon everything was great.  Even the bread that all the tables get was better than all the other neighboring places.,Brandon L.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,4/24/10,"Went here last week for dinner with coworkers while in town.  What a great experience.  The only downfall I really could see was the piano player in the bar.  While I typically do like a little entertainment while dining, this guy's voice was SO overpowering.  By the end of the evening, we were all joking that he really should shut it.  But maybe that's because we'd had quite a few bottles of wine by that point.I started with the french onion soup.  Awesome.  I'm such a sucker for a good onion soup, and this didn't disappoint.  Side note...holy bread!  Smoking hot, crunchy crust, soft inside.  Yum.  For my entree, I had the scallops, which were cooked in a light sauce.  They were really good.  Not the best I'd ever had, but pretty solid.  We split a few sides as well- the mac and cheese was AWESOME, as was the jalapeno au gratin potatoes.  We also had the asparagus...but really, who raves about steamed veggies?Dessert.  For the record, I didn't want dessert, but I somehow managed to pick up my fork and take a few large bites of both the chocolate cake and carrot cake that were passed around the table.  That carrot cake.  Was.  Amazing.  I would go back there if only just for the mac and cheese and the carrot cake.  All in all, a great restaurant, and one I will definitely try again.",Sara P.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,12/19/11,"I had wanted to try Mitchell's Ocean Club for quite some time. I have heard rave reviews from friends and family, and I was really excited to finally get a chance to come here for a pre-Christmas Christmas dinner. Try as I might, it is difficult to find complaints about the Cameron Mitchell restaurants. I'm not a huge fan of Capp City Diner, but other than that, their food and service is always spot on.I'll start with the ambience, which is dark, romantic and classic. The bar was pretty, albeit packed. I am very happy we had reservations.I don't think I can say enough kind words about the service we had at OC. Our server was nice, attentive, interested and helpful. He was full of suggestions and insight, and really helped this become one of the best dining experiences of my life. I really have never received better service anywhere before in my life. These guys are almost too polite! Sometimes I want a server to have a little fun with the table.The food was really amazing, obviously, or this would not be a five star review. The Colossal Shrimp Cocktail was worth the hefty price tag. We took our server's suggestion of splitting a salad and had the Caesar, which was different than any other Caesar. It was somehow tarter (more tart?) without tasting like lemons. I loved it. I also love that they do a loaf of sourdough as well as pretzel bread. I read someone's complaint about these, and I couldn't disagree more. How many places offer bread anymore, let alone whole loaves of sourdough and something as interesting as pretzel bread? I also thought doing creamy, whipped butter was a nice touch. I don't usually like butter on bread, but this was really good. My boyfriend and I shared the truffle fries, which were good, but not as good as the truffle fries at Cameron's (I'm not sure how that's possible, but it's true). I had the salt and pepper tuna, which was perfectly rare and amazing. It was a large portion for the price, as well. I substituted the sauce and side for the mashed potato and truffle and champagne sauce. The sauce was amazing; as were the potatoes, but I don't think potatoes and tuna go together. This was obviously my mistake, so I would never hold that against the house. I took the liberty of tasting my brother's potatoes au gratin, which were basically one of the tastiest things I have ever tried in my life. They were out of this world. We were too full for dessert, unfortunately. I think the portions, including sides, are massive. I don't know how anyone would feel differently unless they eat huge dinners on a regular basis.What I like about OC is that it brings a few items from mad-men style steakhouses (potatoes au gratin, Baked Alaska, waiters in suits, hostesses in cocktail attire) and joins those items with updated, upscale fine dining options from the surf and turf worlds. My Only complaint is that it is very crowded. I understand maximizing tables and minimizing unused space, but it was a bit ridiculous shuffling all the way around the dining room only to be seated at the beginning of our path. This is definitely a special occasion restaurant, at least on my budget. I would be interested to sit at the bar and enjoy small plates and cocktails during their happy hour during a break from shopping, though.",Mindy W.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2001/7/7,"5 stars (for Columbus).  From the breadbasket with a combo of fresh sourdough and seeded flatbread (aka cracker) and soft fat pretzel bread sticks, all the way through the wines and fishes and deserts, it was all mouthwatering scrumptiousness.  The price was high, especially compared to Ohio pricing, but it was worth it all the way.  I don't like that it's attached to a shopping center mall (Easton), but in Ohio, that's just where people like to be i guess, and it's where everything else popular and busy and energetic is, so i guess its suiting.LOVED my chilean sea bass.  The peanut butter chocolate mousse cake sounds kinda sloppy for desert, but it was awesome and very good and fine except that i felt very fat (and happy) after gorging on it.  Great service and nice atmosphere (inside the restaurant, i mean... although Easton is a nice indoor/outdoor shopping center/mall as far as that goes... as the saying goes, when in rome...).  The way they seated/organized reservations was a bit strange - they had a whole ""8:30 pm"" list and had us all (4 groups or so) waiting at the entrance together, until they slowly pushed out the other (6:30?) group, ...so the wait was rather tedious for having already made reservations.  That felt kinda cheesy and cheap.  But I did get to watch an old middle-aged, blond suburban ex-trophy wife with fake boobs drunkenly stumble to the mint dish and push my brother aside for a handful of stale mints.  That was worth seeing.So all in all, a very good restaurant.",Today Y.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,2002/8/10,"One of the better restaurants in Columbus. I went here when it first opened years ago, but they've done some remodeling since (defintely for the better).

He made the experience so much more than the food. But, I can't forget the food..woah!! I had the Chilean Sea Bass in Champagne Truffle sauce. Then had creme brule for desert. My fiance had never tried it and love it!! If it sounds decedent it was. I don't think I have tasted such a delightful masterpiece. I am a serious seafood snob and this topped the charts! The food, the live piano playing, the service all 5 stars!!I would recommend it to anyone.. it is completely worth it!! :)",Mary J.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,2008/10/9,"Without a doubt one of my favorite places to eat in Columbus.  Some people will knock it for its ""corporate"" feel, but let's be honest it's smack dab in the middle of Easton.Inside the restaurant is very easy on the eyes.  They have a great bar as well.  The good:  The food is excellent.  The tuna tartar app is one of the best in the city.  They have great shellfish and obviously the usual suspects iike beef carpaccio are delicious.The bone-in steaks are exquisite and if you're really feeling frisky the lobster is also delicious.  They serve it with these cool butter warmers.I've been here at least 25 times and have had a great meal over 95% of the time.Also I would say the service is excellent.  While I usually sit at the bar (which should always have great service) they are very attentive.  One thing I really like is if you are at the bar and then move to a table they will let you transfer your tab over (the servers don't bicker over tips).The only bad things are the slack dress code policy (seriously, it's embarrassing, but sadly that is how a lot of people dress these days).  And the guy playing the piano is WAY too loud and awful.  Forget about having any semblance of a conversation if you're within 50 feet of this clown.Overall I would recommend Ocean Club to anyone visiting Columbus, or looking for a special occasion type dinner.If you do it right, you can actually sit at the bar, order some apps and split an entree and a few glasses of wine and get out for $100.",Andrew M.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,7/13/14,The calamari appetizer was a surprising interplay of sweet and spicy. We had the scallops and the sea bass. The delicate sauces enhanced by the freshness of the catch was the perfect ending to a saturday night. The service was impeccable.,Hk K.,,,,,,

It was crispy and juicy and very well-spiced.  They have an impressive beer and wine list as well as a good overall menu.

Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,2,11/26/14,"My husband took me here for our anniversary.  We were seated at the balcony outside of the restaurant.  I was anxious to try their dinner thinking with all there 4+ stars it must be amazing!  I ordered the scallops and my husband had the steak special.  I am not impress with the scallops a bit, I can make better at home.  My husband liked his steak but it's not Smith & Wollensky quality.  We arrived at 6pm, by the time we left close to 8pm, the main dinning room was packed with early 20s to early 40s group of people and was very loud.  I am glad we went early and got to sit outside.  This is a place where I would try only once and don't plan on coming back.  For the price of this dinner, it's definitely doesn't live up to all these 4 stars ratings unless I drink until my taste buds no longer able to recognize what I am eating.  I spoke to friends about this restaurant, they told us they went on their first anniversary before they had kids and never came back.  Their oldest son is now 13.  It's probably a great place to impress a date or to social drink, not so much for good seafood.",Kim D.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,4,2001/3/9,"I quite like this newer incarnation more than the old Ocean Club, which gave one the feeling of being in a fishbowl when at the bar. After undergoing millions of dollars of updates (two years ago), ditching the aquatic blue detailing and adding a great wrap-around patio, the new Mitchell's Ocean Club takes on more of a loungey, prime seafood and steak house. The baby grand piano in the entrance way makes it clear there is live music - most nights of the week.  We had intentions of seeing Dave Powers play one night last summer, but he was off and the replacement was good. Not loud or intrusive, just mellow and mostly played rather than sang. back ground music can go either way. I usually find it to be a nice touch, however, we were on the far opposite side of the bar, about as far as one could be from the piano. Not to say it couldn't be loud in some areas. The menu was extensive, with entrees ranging from trout, salmon, snapper and seabass to filet, porterhouse and rack of lamb. I couldn't make up my mind, so we had a little bit of everything - and the chef made sure of it. We ended up with a most amazing sampling of nearly every appetizer: Truffle deviled eggs, calamari, goat cheese raviolis, tuna tartar and beef carpaccio... it was all divine. I'm sure I'm forgetting some.The two bartenders were super friendly and it totally tickled my fancy that one was able to reproduce my favorite martini perfectly from a simple description of the name and color (as I had no idea what exactly was in it).   I ended up splitting an entree, the seabass, with my husband and it melted on our mouths... and it should for $32.  By the end of the night, our tab was no laughing matter. A few $12 martinis, the sample platter of appetizers and an entree went into the triple digits. But we considered it worth the splurge and if I could afford to eat here once a week, I probably would, but alas, I'll settle for a few times a year for special occasions. Maybe next time we'll head for the dining room, which is a little quieter than the bar area. The Ocean Club is not at all a flashy supper club, but it definitely has that sort of undertone with dark wood, white linen tables and formal attired servers. It has a restrained elegance that appeals to my aesthetic, so I really liked the atmosphere of the whole restaurant. AND I'll leave my flip flops at home next time... I felt just fine wearing a sundress, but was a little self-conscious about the flip flop situation. No matter, we had a great meal, memorable service and a very memorable tab!",Shawnie K.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,5,4/15/14,Excellent restaurant.   Service and food are spot on.  I eat here on business several times a year.   Had the surf and turf special tonight.   Thoroughly great.   It is expensive but some things are worth it.   Lobster bisque appetizer is a must.   Always a solid choice.   When a rare mistake is made the wait staff and manager work to correct it as you would expect from a top tier establishment. Mistakes are not the norm but do occasionally occur.   I always give special consideration to places that immediately work to correct the issue.   Tonight one member of our group had a gluten allergy.  The waiter worked with him through out the meal to assure that he had options.,Ken L.,,,,,,
Mitchell's Ocean Club,306,4.5,3,10/16/08,"I expected the Ocean Club to be damn nice. But damn, it was expensive.Greg and I treated his parents to a night out as a thank you for all they've done for us. I felt a little silly walking into a mall all dressed up to go to a nice dinner. But, once we were inside, it didn't feel like I was in a mall.We shared one bottle of wine and each had an entrÌ©e. No salad, no soup, no dessert - nothing else. The meal was over $200. Ugh.I had the mahi mahi. It was good, a little bland. I haven't thought about it much since I ate it. I haven't craved it in the middle of the night or anything, and I most certainly don't think it was worth the price.The wine was excellent. I can't recall quite which one we had, something white.The variety of complimentary breads was very nice and came with several butter and dipping choices.The atmosphere was sleek. It reminded me of a lounge you'd see in an international spy movie, all dark blue with deep colored woods and ambient lighting. The wine display was the focal point. It went to the ceiling and was incased in a lighted bubble case.Our server was an A+. She was polite, almost to the point of discomfort. She was so polite that I began checking myself: Am I sitting up straight?

The seafood at Hama is fresher, as well.I realize it is almost sacreligious to speak out against a Mitchell restaurant in Columbus, but the prices here are no cheaper than M at Miranova yet the service, quality, and presentation is far inferior.Do yourself a favor; if you want to experience Mitchell at his best, head to M.

While the price is definitely not cheap you get excellent food and wonderful service. The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgable and will make sure you have a great dining experience. The food of course is the main attraction here and whether you are seeking seafood or steak you are guaranteed to find something delightful. Each time I have been here we have ordered the raw oysters and they are so fresh and delicious each time. Presentation is a big deal at the Ocean Club as our oysters were brought out on an ice tray with the house made cocktail sauce in a ""smoking"" dish effect from dry ice in the center. Definitely makes is much more of an experience. I forgot to mention the drinks! The Ocean Club has some neat signature cocktails such as the Black Orchid and Elderflower la poire (it was called something like that). I won't spoil the excitement but if you want a delicious and memorable cocktail order one of those. As far as the rest of the meal goes my favorites include the ravioli appetizer which was also very tasty, the lobster bisque, and for the entree I thoroughly enjoyed the filet ala Oscar one time and the sea scallops another. The sides are served family style and my absolute favorite is the Black Truffle Mac & Cheese. It is to die for.

I have had amazing meals in Las Vegas, San Francisco, LA, Key West, and NYC.  The meal at the Ocean Club was definitely on the list. Everything is served ala carte. My girlfriend ordered the tuna with a Maytag blue cheese crust  - absolutely delicious! I ordered a lobster tail, and while it is rather difficult to  screw that up, it was yummy. We got a side of sauteed forest mushrooms and I think we could have eaten a meal consisting of those and the warm sourdough, flatbread, and soft pretzel sticks. The mushrooms were meaty, deep flavored and not at all oily or greasy. We also got mashed potatoes which were good, but focused our efforts on the mushrooms. The waiter was polite, knowledgeable and friendly. We ordered a bottle of champagne (the cheapest :) and our glasses were never even half full because of his attentiveness. The decor is very nice and feels like an updated throw back to the Rat Pack era.My only complaint - and it's not really so much a complaint as an observation - is that its location at Easton means that there are people who look as if they spent the entire day shopping and happened upon the resturaunt. There were groups in jeans and t-shirts and flip-flops and one family with about 4 children under the age of 11 who broke at least 2 glasses. I felt the atmosphere required a bit more formaility. The waitstaff certainly projected a more formal feel. Overall, if you are looking to splurge, go here. You can't miss.",deb k.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,4,2001/2/18,"I can't review much regarding food. We sat at the bar to have a cocktail and appetizer to break from shopping. Service was great. I like whatever house moscato they have. My friends got the crab Rangoon's. They were just ok to me. I do want to go back and eat there sometime, though!",Emily C.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,4,11/27/17,"Had lunch here while Black Friday shopping at the Polaris Mall with my family.Yes, it is a bit on the pricier side, for Asian cuisine, and like some others have said, it reminded me a bit of PF Changs (I even actually said that while we were there). But still very good...lots of options on their menu and good quality food that tasted fresh.Our server was excellent. I can't remember his name, but on my receipt it says Aren. He was awesome, and so friendly.I had the Hunan Chicken, which is stir-fried chicken, broccoli and mushrooms in a fiery brown sauce. However, I don't like mushrooms, so Aren gladly let me swap mushrooms for carrots. My mother had an order of Crab Rangoon and a California Roll. My SIL had the Thai Basil Scallops. I tried the crab rangoon and scallops and both were delicious. Best Crab Rangoon I've had, anywhere.My dish was perfect. The sauce had a nice little kick to it, and there was loads of chicken in my bowl. The portion was large so I had leftovers to take home for a second meal.Again, a little pricey ($32 for the Hunan Chicken, Rangoon and CA Roll), but the quality was better than other Asian restaurants I've been to, so it was worth it to me. Would go back if I were in the area again visiting.",Rebecca M.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,2,9/19/17,"Molly Woo's is fine. But it's a little too expensive to be just fine.We made reservations for our anniversary. We were excited that it had a gluten-free menu and I made note of my wife's allergies when I made the reservation. When they seated us, no gluten-free menu was provided and by the time we realized it was a separate menu, the waitress was gone and we waited more than five minutes for her to come back. Not terrible service, but for the price, I would hope that somebody actually looks at my reservation ahead of time.Then, when our food was served, we were not given gluten-free soy sauce. By now, the server knew about the issue, but again disappeared for seven minutes. Other than these two incidents, the service was unmemorable.The food is just not great. I had the mango chicken and my wife had the firecracker chicken. Both dishes had that commercial Chinese food taste of being overly sweet without much other taste. I didn't taste mango, I tasted sugar. I don't know why Chinese food is moving in that direction. We also ordered sushi and the sushi was not particularly fresh or clean tasting. The fish was a little soggy. It was definitely better than supermarket sushi, but not as good as most average sushi places.The decor is nice, though the room feels a little like a warehouse. Some people have said the lanterns are overdone, but I think it's kind of the point.After tax and tip, the meal cost $68 for the two of us, including the sushi appetizer, a Coke, and a beer. For that cost, I'd like the meal to feel a little special. It did not. Service was average to meh. Food was meh. I would rate this place 3 stars if my meal was closer to $50, but given my experience, I cannot recommend this place.",Adam R.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,5,2001/8/18,"I love Molly Woo's. Has slightly more/better flavors than PF Changs. We always sit at the bar and the three ladies that work there are wonderful. Their happy hour is great: $5 cocktails and apps. The honey chicken is always amazing. As are the crab ragoons and potstickers. Their ragoons are a bit creamier than most but still nice. Overall, a great place to eat",Jenny H.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,3,8/25/17,"We come for happy hour all the time. Yummy food and drinks! We love the king pao calamari, egg rolls, and crab Rangoon. We often get the lettuce wraps, but they aren't the best I've had (for the best lettuce wraps, try Hunan House!)My favorite cocktail is the blackberry bourbon. For dinner we love the coconut curry shrimp, garlic chicken and their wonton soup. They also have an awesome coconut cream pie. I'm not vegetarian, but I really do love their crispy tofu. Hit or miss:Dan Dan noodles (they use the same chicken for this as for their lettuce wraps - sometimes it's a bit to gristly) Firecracker chicken - I think it depends on who makes it. Sometimes the veggies are different and cut differently. I don't think this is the best Asian in Columbus. It's comparable to PF Changs, but I think Changs is slightly better. You do get amazing service and it's nicer ambiance than most of the Asian places around.",Malini S.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,4,6/18/17,"The food here is comparable to P.F. Chang's but what really sets Molly Woo's apart is their service and beverages. I had a blackberry bourbon, which was one of the most unique alcoholic beverages I've ever had. Visually it was unlike anything I'd ever seen with it's deep red color and flavor-wise it was fantastic! Hubby opted for the homemade ginger ale, which totally challenged both of our perceptions of what ginger ale should be. Our server Andrew was knowledgable and patient and made excellent suggestions, including both of the aforementioned drinks.",Valerie P.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,3,8/24/16,"Man oh man, did Cameron Mitchell open his wallet wide for this Asian restaurant of his.  It's fancy and it's classy without a doubt and it has enough eye appeal to make this the perfect place for a dinner to impress.  The multitude of red Chinese lanterns are a nice touch too.The food, on the other hand, could have been better... Now, I love a good Mai Tai ($9.75) and theirs certainly looks cool in their tiki glasses with the little paper umbrella but they have all the all the oomph of a glass of fruit punch.  I passed on their rather pricey Hot and Sour Soup ($5.95) as I wasn't up for spending $30+ for lunch that day.  The lunch sized Hunan Chicken ($10.69) was a decent sized portion and it did come out with a considerable amount of chicken but the meat vis-a-vis the vegetable balance was way off.  All in all, this dish reminded me of a zestier but soupier version of a Chinese buffet Chicken and Mushrooms with a little added broccoli.  3 stars for more flash than substance.",Mike G.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,3,2/20/17,"I had never heard of Molly Woo's Asian Bistro until my mom and I came to Polaris shopping center on a Sunday afternoon. We were hungry and didn't realize most of the shops at Polaris didn't open until noon. Luckily, Molly Woo's opened at 11:30, so we stopped in for a quick bite to eat. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The food, similar to PF Chang's, came out fast. If you're looking for authentic Asian food, this isn't the spot for you. But if you're looking for PF Chang's-type Americanized Asian, Molly Woo's hits the spot. We decided to just ordered a bunch of appetizers and split them as our meal. I got a bowl of hot and sour soup, my mom got egg drop soup. Both soups were delicious and piping hot. We split an order of chicken lettuce cups - again, tasty and hit the spot. We also shared an order of potstickers and one Caterpillar sushi roll. The potstickers were good - hard to mess those up. And the Caterpillar sushi roll was ok. The spicy tuna tasted a little off but all in all, a decent sushi roll. So if you find yourself at Polaris and craving decent Asian American food, Molly Woo's delivers.",Courtney P.,,,,,,

We ordered the crab Rangoon as an appetizer and it's probably the best Rangoon I've ever had. I ordered the Mango Chicken with fried rice which was absolutely amazing. My FiancÌ©e ordered the Lo Mein with chicken and shrimp which was equally as amazing. The food, the service, the atmosphere this place deserves more than 5 stars. I used to pass this place all of the time because I assumed it was too expensive but it's not! We spent just over $40 on 1 app, 2 entrees and 1 non alcoholic cocktail! Give this place a try if you've never had it, but only if you're ready to have your taste buds explode.",Casey C.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,3,1/31/17,"Molly Woo's was overall an okay experience. I really loved our waiter, he was funny and attentive. The food was alright. Perhaps I've been spoiled with homemade Asian food growing up, I felt that the food was good but not spectacular, especially compared to the fantastic experiences I've had at other Cameron Mitchell locations. We ordered Pad Thai and Dan Dan Noodles, I liked the Pad Thai better. The Dan Dan noodles were good but too salty in my opinion, but I do recognize that westernized Chinese food is typically saltier than traditional Chinese food. I went during lunch and one thing that I did not enjoy as much was the dark and red lighting. I understand they are going for a specific feel/atmosphere, but it was almost too dark to see and lighting was too red, especially at lunch time. I wished it was a little brighter.",Grace L.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,5,10/23/16,"Arrived last Sunday about 11:30 and were seated immediately in a near empty restaurant.  My wife and were impressed by the decor and our waiter, Gary, made us feel welcome right away.  I order the honey chicken and my wife tries the hunan chicken.  We had never been to a Chinese restaurant like this as we have only been to our local MSG-heavy establishments that normally leave us feeling ill.   Our food arrives at the 15 minute mark and both of our dishes are near perfect - can't think of a thing I would change.  I somehow managed to eat my entire dish and did not hear as much as a gurgle from my stomach; normally I would feel like I needed to be carried out via stretcher.  Ingredients must be higher grade and flavor enhancers must not be used at Molly Woo's.I believe our total lunch bill, without tip, was around $30 and was worth every dime.

Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,5,5/26/16,"Listen... We all know that this is American- Chinese food. Lol, everyone needs to simmer down. That being said, this is the goddamn best American Chinese food I have ever had. I drive TWO hours just to come to this place... Cuyahoga Falls just doesn't have good food. I've Tangoed with just about everything on the menu, but the Hunan Chicken is my favorite. The sauce has so many different flavor elements to it: a little spicy, nutty, garlicky, etc. Tender pieces of white meat mixed with tender broccoli, mushrooms and chili peppers. You can choose white or brown (/gag) rice to accompany your dish. It's seriously so good, and you get a lot, but I always finish my plate because MAMA DIDN'T RAISE NO QUITTER. The sushi is pretty good, too. Always fresh and flavorful.

Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,4,1/19/17,"At Polaris and decided lunch at Molly Woo's....not disappointed....Started off with lettuce wraps, very tasty, light, a great starter to share with friends or that special person....I ordered an orange beef and girlfriend ordered orange chicken, I tried both, I think the orange chicken was a little better, both were delicious, the orange chicken was a bed or piping hot fried chicken in a tasty orange glaze...sometimes orange chicken has too much sauce which makes it soggy and takes away from the chicken, not the case here....entrees came with steamed white or brown rice, also I would recommend ordering the ginger ale, chunks of real ginger make the soft drink over the top and a must have if you like ginger..Service was excellent, in and out for lunch within an hour....Thanks MW for an enjoyable afternoon : ))",Chris C.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,4,2006/8/16,"My fiancee and I met up at Molly Woo's with two of our work buddies!  My fiancee and I started out with the calamari witch was delicious (I prefer the ponzu sauce to the srirachi mayo but that's just me!)Our pals ordered the crab rangoon and the dumplings; both said they were great.For entrees, I tried the honey chicken (with brown rice) while my wife to be had the Pad Thai.  Our friends ordered the Pad Thai and Sesame Beef, respectively.  Those two loved their dishes.My honey chicken was tasty!  Sweet but with a little bit of spice to it.  I'm looking forward to trying the teriyaki shrimp next time.Now, dessert.  My fiancee and I were looking forward to splitting the banana spring roll; when we ordered it we were told that we would receive half of the order because of an error in the kitchen.  A few minutes later, we were told that the banana spring rolls were all gone, but that we would receive the donut dessert on the house.  Awesome!Donuts were great.  Our friends both ordered the creme brulee; one had never tried creme brulee before and ended up sending it back (no fault of the kitchen, she just didn't like it).  Other friend loved it!This is where my 4 instead of 5 star comes out.  We waited over ten minutes to get our check after it was beyond clear that our dessert was finished.

Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,4,6/16/16,"My friend and I stopped in at Molly Woo's as we were about to exit Polaris Fashion Place. We were hungry and contemplating fast food on the way back to our hotel when the impressive facade and even more impressive smell brought us into Molly Woo's. The host was a man with a very splendid Rollie Fingers style mustache and even better attitude and approach to customer service and hospitality. He was very accommodating to us and my friends little girl, a baby who was with us. (I'm so used to restaurant personnel giving a knowing, exhausted glance at babies- I get that babies can be loud and unpredictable, but give us a chance!)I can't remember our waiter's name, but he was very accommodating and polite throughout our dinner. He brought the drinks very quickly and the food as well. I had the Firecracker Shrimp and fried brown rice, which was not too spicy and pretty delicious. My friend had the fried rice bowl and loved it. The decor and atmosphere is very beautiful. I loved the plethora of red lanterns hanging from the ceiling and believe it or not the baby with us did too. She was so mesmerized by them that she barely made a peep the whole time.The beer selection isn't bad, but it's not great. That's about the only thing I think needs any improving. I'd definitely recommend stopping here for a bite to eat.",Courtney K.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,4,2004/10/16,"In my opinion, Molly Woo's isn't doing anything new or creative but the food is definitely better than any Chinese buffet you'll find and it's even a slight notch above P.F. Chang's. We went on a Sunday a little before 1:00pm, and though they were pretty busy we were very quickly seated at a table in the center of the open-room restaurant. All of the waiters we dealt with were friendly and professional and the food was served quickly. My husband ordered 2 appetizers for his meal: fried pot stickers and lettuce cups. Both were presented beautifully and tasted delicious. The lettuce cups were super similar to PF Chang's except the chicken was larger and chunkier and soaked up a lot of the juices which I prefer over traditional wet lettuce wraps. I had the garlic chicken (with no scallions). The chicken was juicy and lightly battered and fried. Tasted great, but I will say that it was not spicy at all even though the menu says it is. I also had the fried rice which was very good, and a side of the rainbow vegetables since I love baby corn and broccoli in that brown sauce. Prices were comparable to any chain restaurant so no surprises there. Overall, Molly Woo's is nothing mind blowing but if you're craving really good Americanized Chinese food in a gorgeous restaurant environment I would definitely recommend this place. Plus it's conveniently attached to one of the greatest malls in Ohio so you can fill your belly up and then go walk it off while you're shopping.",Jessica L.,,,,,,

We have our 18 month in tow and sit in a booth in the bar. Bill welcomed us with a wonderful smile and was so kind. As an ex-server I know kids can be annoying but he was more than cordial. Our daughter has a severe egg allergy and when we asked about the prep of the food he very knowledgeably expressed that all the meats were marinated with egg. He immediately offered to check with the chef to see if anything was prepped and not marinated. I told him that was unnecessary and he insisted. He came back letting us know that all options we available. We ordered her beef and broccoli and she loved it. Our meals were outstanding. He was very (very) concerned about us letting her get a hold of our potstickers since they do have egg. That was very sweet. Bottom line, we had a great experience as always.

The only beers they had on draft though was mainly only Sapporo. For starters we got Crab Rangoons. They came with some sort of dipping sauce. We're pretty particular about how we like our rangoons, and these came out harder/crispier than we like.I tried the California and Spicy Salmon roll. These were actually pretty good. You can tell this was better than grocery store or cheap chinese, since the chucks of salmon and crab were big! However, I didn't taste any spiciness in my spicy salmon roll.My fiance got the Firecracker Chicken and thought it was good. But it's $14.50.. I could get something comparable for about $10 at another Chinese restaurant =/ The point of going to a Cameron Mitchell restaurant is for the quality and atmosphere, both of which this place was lacking.And on to the atmosphere: there was only the quietest music playing and it was fairly empty inside. We were sitting in pretty awkward silence whenever we weren't talking.I'd go back since it's a pretty nice sit down restaurant, and maybe it's better for lunch or during peak dinner time (not happy hour).

Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,3,2001/2/17,"I loved the decor, and our waiter was friendly, charming and professional.  The food was such a disappointment.  The food is dead mediocre, and no one in our party of 10 was impressed with their order.  It was edible, but often oily.  The fried rice was oily, the Hot and Sour soup was canned tasting and my Thai Seafood Medley was oily and bland despite asking for it to be extra spicy. Oily is not a flavor! I really wanted the food to be worth coming back for, but it is not. The decor deserves better than food being less interesting than a strip mall $5 all you can eat China Buffet.",Debbie R.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,3,2006/7/12,"The decor and ambiance is beautiful,don't quite get the almost pitch black bathrooms, how is a lady to freshen up?Especially since the rest of the place isn't dimly lit, this was just strange...We sat in the bar area, thankfully they have a few booths, which we were lucky enough to nab.Happy hour has $5 apps, and all kinds of drinks so I took full advantage of that and got the potstickers, spring rolls, lettuce wraps and tempura fried veggies.I think even for $5 each it was pretty steep, 2 super greasy eggrolls, one bite and i sent them back.The potstickers were great just nothing unexpected.The fried veggies yummy, but also super greasy.My favorite was the lettuce wraps, in my opinion where you get the most for you money, it was half a iceberg (made me think I'v paid way more for a fourth a wedge at other places like Eddie Merlots last week) with chicken, noodles and water chestnuts.The man had the honey chicken with fried rice which he enjoyed.In all I was expecting more from a Cameron Mitchell restaurant, it was not bad, just nothing I haven't had a thousend times before and $35 including tax and tip is steep for the fact that these were happy hour prices and we only got one entree, 3 apps and no drinks, sat in the bar not getting to fully enjoy the inside of the restaurant which I'm sure would have been a much nicer meal with a view better than the insdie of the mall.",Nijole T.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,3,2005/12/14,"Molly Woo's is a place that I frequent about once a year.  The decor is very nice and the restaurant has a very attractive interior ambiance.  On our most recent visit, the service and the food were both very good.   I was, however, disappointed with the Wonton soup which I remembered enjoying on previous visits.  It seems that the sodium content of the Wonton soup has increased dramatically during my last couple of visits.  In fact, it's gotten so salty that I won't be ordering it during any future visits.  On this visit, I had their Dan Dan Noodles - one of their ""rice and noodle dishes"" and it was exceptionally good (chicken, onions, carrot, sprouts and cucumbers in a spicy garlic sauce).  My wife had the Lo Mein Combo (chicken and pork) with assorted vegetables which was also very good.Overall - I think the food is reasonably priced although it's a bit pricier than your ""run of the mill"" Chinese restaurant.  On the flip side - I think the drink menu is a bit over-priced and we were satisfied with iced tea.  Another plus - unlike many restaurants that serve watered-down iced tea, the tea was served cold but not with a lot of ice - the waitress then offered to bring an extra glass of ice that we could add at our own convenience - NICE TOUCH.I'd recommend this as more of a ""special occasion"" restaurant than a place you'd go to on a regular basis looking for Chinese food.  It's a lot more upscale than your typical neighborhood Chinese restaurant.",Jim H.,,,,,,

Everything was delicious, not too heavily sauced, and was the appropriate levels of hot and cold.Our waiter was polite and knowledgeable.

Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,5,10/19/14,"The Woo's Spare Ribs appetizer is enough of a reason to try this place. During happy hour, these appetizers are half price! Think crisp, juicy, sweet and slightly hot, meat candy. Pair this with a pot of Crimson Berry Fruit Tisane and you have a perfect snack or small meal. The acidity of the tea cuts the fatty taste of the ribs, and clears the pallet for the next bite. I've noticed some variation in flavor over the years. It's always good, but sometimes, it's blow-your-mind, wet-your-pants good. I salivate every time I think about them. I was told they boil the ribs to cook and tenderize them, then they sear them for crispness. The sauce is what really makes this dish. Get an order to go, because you'll want more by the time you get home.Their desserts are insane too. The Banana Spring rolls are my favorite. I don't even really care for bananas, but warm bananas wrapped in spring roll wraps drizzled with chocolate sauce, topped with crushed peanuts, and complemented with cold, high-quality, creamy, vanilla ice cream is a winner. Their seasonal Pumpkin Won-tons dessert is a serious contender.I've had many of their other dished and I've never been disappointing with the food. Servers are usually good. The hostesses usually need a lesson in customer service. They seem to think they actually have power, not just restaurant power. The definition of hospitality is: ""the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers"". This is a job ripe for automation in our economy. Most hostesses just suck. Save yourself the aggravation and eat in the bar area. Service is always great there.",Bret B.,,,,,,

I love the staff and the good never disappoints! I've been going here for probably 10 years now and have befriended staff members who have grown into managerial professionals. I always get the firecracker chicken w/ mushrooms on the side and definitely crab ran goons for starters! This is one of many great Cameron Mitchell restaurants that the city of Columbus has to offer. I wish this place could be found in other major cities but sometimes that's just the way it is! That's what makes the journey of finding great places to dine more interesting! The decor is amazing and no detail was missed in creating a very relaxing and beautiful environment for its patrons.

I've only come in here for lunch, but always enjoy the food and service. In the past two times, I've had the lettuce wraps, the crab rangoon, the egg rolls, and the happy family entree. My mom and I typically pick two items and split them and it is always enough food for the both of us. On this particular time, we came in here around 1pm after a bit of shopping. We opted for a booth in the bar as we didn't want a lengthy experience. We chose the lettuce cups (as they are called here, but they are lettuce wraps) and the crab rangoon. The lettuce wraps were by far some of my favorite lettuce wraps. The chicken mixings is perfectly cooked and the sauce they use gives it enough flavor without drenching the entire wrap. The crab rangoon was good as well. They offer six of them. They are smaller than a regular chinese restaurant, but much tastier! I also went with a glass of pinot noir, while my mom had iced tea. The bartender did a fine job, but the service was nothing to write home about. We did sit in the bar for a reason and all in all it was a good experience. I'd be happy to come back.",Megan A.,,,,,,

The crab rangoons were good but I sent back the chicken lettuce wraps.  The chicken was just cooked to mush practically.  No prob! They took it back and I got something else - the spring rolls.  I tried the veggie sushi roll (wait! if no fish does it still count as sushi?) and it was interesting but not something I'd go for again.

The three of us ordered a few things and kind of shared everything: the chicken cabbage salad, firecracker shrimp, spicy scallop roll and spicy tuna roll, plus drinks.

My teenager had the recommended Sake Shrimp and was not very delighted. Like she states ""we could've gone somewhere else and got more bang for our buck"".

The company has often been another matter, but I can't guarantee that for everyone.It's nicely appointed, the food is solid, service has always been good, the patio is nice, and the drinks are tasty.

My roomie and I went for a girls night out and had ordered a gluttonous sushi, an appetizer of crab rangoon (oh yum!) the happy family, and the kung pao chicken.  I took a bite of something in the happy family, and a bone or something sliced the side of my tongue.  I spit out the food into my napkin and stopped eating.The server came by and asked if we wanted a box and I declined and told her what happened.  2 minutes later the manager was at the table, offered us a free dessert and an apology.

Airy, whimsical, fantasy Asia. Lovely.The food is ""meh."" As others have said, perhaps the biggest disappointment is that this is a Cameron Mitchell restaurant. Everything about the food is boring. It's exactly what you would find at any Americanized chinese takeout place, nothing more, nothing less. The problem is that you expect more.I couldn't find anything on the menu that looked inventive. Most dishes begin with a breaded&fried chicken and topped with a too-sweet slick brown sauce.

It has consistently well prepared dishes, the wait staff (and bartenders) are friendly & attentive, and there are few surprises.For cocktails, the bartenders make great martinis with  inventive flavors!   If you try something new & you don't like it, they will happily make something else for you which is nice.For starters, the lettuce cups are excellent, as well as the seared pot stickers. The sushi is delicious, especially the spicy tuna roll with cream cheese & avacado. For entrees, I've never had a bad meal. My favorites are the Woo's Garlic Chicken, the Cashew Chicken & the Mongolian Beef. My friend always gets the Dan Dan Noodles & says they are the best around. The portions are large. I usually box up half my meal immediately & it's perfect for lunch the next day.In the summertime, the outdoor seating is preferred. Even though it faces the mall parking lot, they did a good job turning the area into a private little oasis. (unlike the Brio)",Rose S.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,4,2008/11/14,"Great food. If your not familiar with this restaurant like we were, if you low of or have been to PF Changs, it is very similar. They have great drinks such as the Godzilla and the Sangria is AMAZING! The one downside if that the egg rolls are $7.95 for only 2 pieces. The lettuce wraps get you further for the price.",David G.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,2,2008/12/15,"First things first, this review is on food and portion size only. Our server was Excellent. She made our night. My wife and I had never had dinner here. Our night out was our first night out since our sons where born. Other than our server being great, we should have taken a nap somewhere. I got the Kung Pow Scallops ( I think that is what it was called) and my wife got Wor Sui guy. ( I don't know how to spell).  My meal was almost $18.00 and Annie's was $15. We should have gone to Lucky Dragon! My scallops where fishy and the chicken portion was so small. And Both of our sauces tasted the same. We thought this would be 2 absolutely different tasting meals but they tasted the same with different textures. We go to Cameron Mitchell restaurants often but this one will be very hard for us to go back to. We dropped $90 bucks on 2 meals and 2 drinks each and honestly left hungry!  It seemed to be a lot of regulars at the bar, so we must be missing something. It is hard for me to right a poor review on one of CM restaurants but this one the food did not do much for us.",Andy A.,,,,,,

My experiences have all been pleasant, just nothing that really stood out, except for maybe the decor.  They've put a lot into the decor here; all designed for an Asian ambience.  Have to give their designers an A+ for that.  The staff have always been great.   I just always struggle with the menu.   Each time I struggle to find something that appeals to me.  The wait staff always suggest items, but none have really been memorable.  I did have the Mongolian Seafood Hot Pot for lunch on my last visit and enjoyed it, but I think I enjoy the decor more than the meals.

Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,4,3/21/11,"I moved to Columbus from the Cleveland area a few months ago and was amazed by the lack of good Asian food in the city. I tried a few other places with dismal results. I could throw a rock and hit a Panda Express in this city but finding a place that provides good Asian cuisine is like locating Big Foot. I live close to Polaris and decided to give Molly Woo's. Good choice. The location is easy to find, there is parking readily available, it's decorated nice, the service is good, and most importantly the food is very good. It's a bit pricey but worth it. I was disappointed that for $7.50 I only received TWO spring rolls. To say I found that ridiculous was an understatement. I had the basil scallops for my entree which were absolutely delicious. It's easy to overcook scallops, but these were cooked perfectly. I noticed A LOT of children with their parents at Molly Woo's, which is fine, if they are well behaved. I generally go out to eat later in the evening to avoid the family of 4 crowd. Kids really aren't my thing, especially when they are hanging over the back of my booth and making me feel uncomfortable while I try to eat.

Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,5,5/16/11,"I can't help it.  I love Molly Woo's.  Molly Woo's is able to combine my favorite parts of chains (streamlined best practice type service, menu items that taste pretty close to the same every time) with my favorite parts of independent restaurants (good service, some original dishes).  I've never had to wait here (although you can make reservations online if you worry about that sort of thing).  I've never had a bad meal here.  I love that you can get brown or white rice.  I love that you can get chinese AND sushi and both of them taste good and like they're supposed to.  I like entrees are brought to you so that it's easy to share with other people you're dining with.  I'm a spicy tuna roll and sesame chicken kind of girl, in case you're curious.  And, I have to reiterate, I love that I've never had to wonder where the server is with my napkins/water/whatever else I need.  They always appear before I start wondering if they died.All this being said, it should be noted that this is Chinese done American.  The decor is red walls and paper lanterns, but the music is more ""Rock the Casbah"" (which kind of made my last dining experience here anyway, so I'm into this sort of thing).  I've seen everything from cut offs to prom dresses here, so come as you are (which might be partly due to it being kind of part of Polaris Mall).Also of note: sake on draft!

None of us had ever been to the restaurant so we were uncertain of what to expect.The four of us split an order of the potstickers.  Very typical Chinese restaurant fare, but I'd have expected something a bit more from CM (especially at $7.95).  My friends each ordered a main plate and I tried the vermicelli salad.  My friend's dishes were good, but not fantastic.  My salad was overwhelming in size, I was only able to consume half.  It was something I'd expect from a Vietnamese restaurant, but at twice the price.Sadly it seems you pay for the atmosphere at Molly Woo's, it has a gorgeous and clean interior with attentive staff.

Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,2,2009/9/10,"As I mentioned on my review of Tai's Asian Bistro, I am a New York transplant pretentious Chinese food snob. For all the background on that, please read that review! But as I had mentioned there, I love most Chinese food varieties, from sit-down, to creepy carry-out, to indie mall Chinese food. But there are two kinds I really do hate: Ultra-Americanized and Chain (i.e. Panda Express or Manchu Wok) Chinese. And unfortunately, Molly Woo's definitely falls under Americanized Chinese.You can always tell Americanized Chinese food when you bite into it. It's not saucy enough. The breading on the General Tso's or Sesame Chicken is too hard. The chicken doesn't taste right. And you can always tell Americanized Chinese restaurants when you visit them. They look ULTRA Asian, attempting cover up their Americanness with ornate decor such as paper lanterns and dragons. And that's exactly how Molly Woo's was.Every other Cameron Mitchell restaurant that I have been to, I have adored. Martini is quite certainly my favorite Italian restaurant in Columbus. But this foray into Chinese food did not work for me. My Sesame Chicken was basically tasteless. It was so unmemorable that I do not remember what my girlfriend got.Sorry Columbus, but I would choose Tai's Asian Bistro over Molly Woo's any day of the week.

We got there at 5:45 - only to sit down and then be told they weren't serving Happy Hour because of New Year's Eve. I would have no problem with that - except that the website indicated they had Happy Hour and the little table tents in the bar listed their Happy Hour options.

Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,4,2/15/09,"The middle part of February has been dubbed 'hell week' by my boyfriend and I, who celebrate our anniversary, Valentine's Day, and his birthday all within an eight day span. This past Friday, we celebrated two of the three 'holidays' with a dinner at Molly Woo's. Neither of us had been there before.We meant to go out on Wednesday when there were fewer people, but we ended up going out on Friday, the day before Valentine's Day, at peak dinner time. It was hard for us to find a parking spot, and it would have been smarter to call ahead for reservations. The place was packed, and we had to wait about thirty-five minutes for a table, but there were cushioned couches and chairs to wait in, and I could tell the hostesses were doing there best to ferret out empty tables.While we waited, I enjoyed the decor. It was super China themed, all red with lots of jellyfish lanterns hanging from the ceiling. They had real bamboo trees flagging the entrance, and lots of pottery and Chinese carved wood. They managed to achieve an upscale Chinese theme and totally avoid tackiness - kudos for not having a stereotypical Koi pond or photos of the Great Wall.Our waiter, Jason, was awesome. He was friendly and knowledgeable, and he took good care of us. We started the night with drinks. Greg got a boring old beer. I got the Godzilla - a mix of OJ, pineapple juice, and Midori. It came with an umbrella - tres chic! I couldn't really taste the Midori. It was more like a super pineapple-y fruit punch.From there it was on to apps. I had the Crab Rangoon, and Greg had the Chicken Lettuce Cups. If you've read any of my past Chinese food reviews, you'll know that I have been hard pressed to find good Crab Rangoon in Columbus. Molly Woo's is the best I've had thus far. The shells were thin and crispy, and they were loaded with filling. We were expecting little muffin-tin shaped lettuce containers for our Chicken Lettuce Cups, but the dish was more like a Chinese burrito. The lettuce came out like a stack of tortillas with a chicken/scallion/water chestnut mixture on the side. It was DIY from there. The menu said the Cups were supposed to be spicy. I don't care much for heat, but I was able to handle the Lettuce Cups with no problem at all.For dinner, I chose the Pineapple Chicken (a compliment to my Godzilla drink) and Greg - without the option of his standard General Tso's - went for the Beef and Broccoli. The meals were family-sized, larger than I expected. The Pineapple Chicken was fantastic! It was the whitest, juiciest Chinese food chicken I've ever had. The pieces were large and crisp. The sweet and sour sauce was just right, and they didn't skimp on the pineapples (the best part of any sweet and sour dish). Greg really enjoyed his Beef and Broccoli too.Sadly, we were stuffed from our apps. I ate about 1/3 of my entree before declaring my defeat. Greg, who never walks out with a box, also had to have his meal packaged. And still, our waiter sold us on dessert, a limited edition lemon cheesecake with blueberry and whipped cream topping. Granted, we had it boxed too.Molly Woo's is near the top of my Cameron Mitchell Restaurant list. I can't wait to go back. If I could, I'd give them 4.5 stars.",Morgan D.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,5,2011/9/9,"I used to live in Columbus and when I did, I frequented Molly Woos as often as possible.

My personal favorite is the cashew chicken. The chicken has great flavor, covered in a incredible brown sauce and shares the plate with a million cashews and pea pods. Another reason we go is because Molly celebrates b-days in style. They let the birthday person pick a dessert on the menu for free. See our picture. This year we got a egg roll banana. Unbelievable.

The server almost encouraged us to make substitutions and customizations with the menu which was a nice change.  We ate family style so I got to try a lot of different dishes.

Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,3,1/26/09,"I was taken on a date here a while ago. I had never tried Molly Woo's and since I love Chinese food, I was pretty excited about trying out this new place.It was hard for us to find a place to park. Molly Woo's is located in the Polaris Mall, so it shares the mall parking lot. I think you can get into the restaurant from the mall, but they also have a huge entrance so you don't even have to go to the mall at all, but you do have to deal with that parking situation. They have valet parking, where you can just pull your car up to the front entrance under this balcony area, but we didn't do that. We had to drive around a bit to find and spot and when we did, it was sort of far away. I never mind the walking, but it was winter so it was cold out.When we got inside I couldn't believe how red everything was! I guess that is the theme that they're going for. The walls are red, the lights were red, so everything had this reddish glow. It looked kind of cool but I felt like I was on the set of some Kung-Fu movie where the evil Chinese drug lord would come out from behind a curtain and start a gun war. It didn't quite feel like just a restaurant. I'm happy to say, however, that I did not see any evil Chinese drug lords. Just servers and food. But I can't say for sure what went on in the back room...I'm kidding. I'll stop.We waited at the hostess area and there was a little bit of a wait - not much. It was a Friday or Saturday night around 8, so it's fair that it was a little busy. We didn't even have to wait 5 minutes until a table was ready, however, and we were seated at a booth on the edge of the dining room. I was happy about this because I always prefer booths and considered myself lucky because most of the seating here seems to be tables.Our hostess said our server would be right with us. She wasn't. It took her a while to show up and take our drink order. After that, even longer for her to show up to take our dinner order. Usually I don't mind, unless I'm in a hurry or something, but I hate dates. And this one wasn't one of the better ones in my life. So sitting and waiting meant suffering through more date conversation. I realized that perhaps my opinion of Molly Woo's is skewed because of the circumstance I was in, but I'm trying to remain objective here. And this just happened to be one of the times that I was not happy about the server's spotty appearances. I just wanted to get this dinner over with.Finally she came back and we could order. Luckily we skipped the appetizers and I opted for the Cashew Chicken. I wanted to try something a little different than Cashew Chicken, which they have at every Chinese place, but it seemed to be one of the only chicken dishes at Molly Woo's which wasn't fried. I just wasn't in the mood for fried or breaded chicken and although the Honey Chicken sounded good, it was fried. The Pineapple Chicken also sounded good but it was fried. So I went with the cashews since there weren't a lot of other options. Oh well. I suppose that I could have asked to substitute, but you know, sometimes on first dates you don't want to appear all picky. Bad first impression.An even longer wait for the food. Sure, there were a lot of tables, but really? I know that it probably seemed long because I was itching to get out of there, but in all reality it probably did take our food between 25-30 minutes to be placed in front of us. My cashew chicken looked pretty good. My date ordered some kind of seafood dish with shrimp. He was telling me about how he loved this place and came here all the time and that was why he brought me here. He told me how good everything was, so I was expecting it to be so great since he kept raving about it. But my chicken? Quite mediocre. It tasted just about like every other cashew chicken I've had, which was mostly been carryout from little Chinese to go joints. From his talking the place up, to the fancy decor of the interior, to the valet parking, to the fact that Molly Woo's is a Cameron Mitchell restaurant, I guess that I was expecting a little more flavor, a little more oomph. The chicken was ultimately pretty plain. It was good, and the chicken was at least quality meat, but there was nothing really special about the dish. Nevertheless, I was happy to be moving the date along and proceeded to enjoy my chicken and white rice.I think that I might give Molly Woo's another chance someday, maybe I'll just have to try something different on the menu. And I've since heard good things about their appetizers. Perhaps they do deserve another chance. But I all in all wasn't exactly wowed by their choices on the menu, either. They seemed to offer what you can get at Chinese restaurants anywhere else, and if the Cashew Chicken was any indication, it will probably taste the same as anywhere else, too. Which isn't necessarily bad, but I think that Molly Woo's is a bit more expensive than most other places, probably just because it's Cameron Mitchell.",Stephanie B.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,2,2006/4/8,"I came here for a birthday party with friends, and I went in sort of expecting to dislike it based on the categorization of most of the vegetarian dishes as ""sides"" (and they are in fact smaller than the entrees) and the generally boring menu.  On one of the happier notes of my visit, my expectation was met.The food itself wasn't _bad_.  People seemed generally satisfied.  The Molly's Feast (aka the only vegetarian entree) wasn't very big, but was ok.  However, I asked for it spicy and received it smothered in chili paste.  The friend to my right asked for her curry noodles spicy and they had no noticeable heat.  Also, my ""garden roll"" was pretty much flavorless and constructed with microgreens that were definitely off-peak (yellowing, spotted).  On a fun note, every. single. vegetarian dish on the menu is served ""in garlic sauce.""The service was not so great.  Granted, we were a large party, so allowances should be made.  My server failed to refill waters during the entree when I actually needed it (see: chili-inundated vegetables) and got my rice order wrong.  At one point he asked the table, ""wait, how many steamed rices were there?"" as though expecting us to have counted.  They also ran out of martini glasses.  How do you run out of martini glasses at a large restaurant with a large martini section on your menu?The prices, while not outrageous, were not a great deal for almost completely ordinary Americanized Chinese food. ($5-6 for apps and desserts, $10-$15 for entrees).Last but not least, the coffee was lukewarm and not particularly good.  People did seem generally pleased with the desserts, though.In summary, Cameron Mitchell apparently sat down one day and said to himself, ""I want to copy P.F. Chang's!""  While both have nearly-over-the-top Asian-themed decor and cater well to Midwesterners, P.F. Chang's has better food, better service, and a more extensive and interesting menu.  I'd go back to Molly Woo's, but probably only if someone else were paying.  And driving.  2.5 stars.",Kevin M.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,4,2009/12/10,It was really busy here the night we decided to go.... Encouraged by a gift card. Put our name in to sit at a table and we were told there was a good wait. We wandered into the bar and sat down and decided we were fine with eating there. Bartenders were awesome and our food was out fast. Loved the samurai roll and caterpillar roll. I devoured the house salad. The dressing was fantastic! My boyfriend got the firecracker chicken and it too was wonderful... Just the right amount of sweet and spicy... Like me haha.,Lindsay B.,,,,,,

The spring rolls and sweet/sour sauce were bland and my main dish of Mongolian something was just ehh.  The service was excellent; the waitress guided me through my indecisiveness without any outward discontent. They do have a good selection of gluten-free items and if we go back it will be because of that. Otherwise if we want that kind of Chinese food we will stick with PF Changs.",Jackie C.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,4,7/22/07,"I really enjoy Molly Woo's even though I feel like it should fall into the guilty-pleasure category.  As Mike S mentioned, the service is always great and while I've occasionally had to wait, it's never too brutal and you can get some shopping done in the meantime.  I really like the decor as well and think that it adds a fun ambiance.I always order the same thing - the spring rolls and Molly's Feast (crispy tofu and assorted vegetables in brown sauce).  The staff has always been very nice about substituting some vegetables for other - I always substitute the tomatoes for baby corn.  The mixed drinks are good as well and not too strong.This is probably the most affordable Cameron Mitchell restaurant and my personal favorite.",Emily H.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,4,2004/3/11,"Cameron Mitchell does Americanized Chinese. Pros: Quick, friendly service; good menu selection; delicious food; well decorated; generous portion sizes for entrÌ©es.Cons: too fast (25 minutes total from sit down to meal completion); tad overpriced.My boyfriend took me to Molly Woos at Polaris. This restaurant is part of the mall, not its own building; so most of the patrons are mall guests. We found parking just fine...I thought the restaurant was nicely decorated and the space was well designed. The paper lanterns were abundant, and repetitive but nice and the other details were well thought-out.We had made a reservation, but there probably was no need since the dining room was only half full (7:30p on a Friday night). Our table was one of the booths near the south windows. Even though the dining room was half full, it was loud. Our waiter was prompt, friendly, polite, and helpful. She had good menu recommendations, she was quick to refill a drink or to take another order, and her timing for food arrival was perfect. She was professional, not trying to chat up our table or hover over us. This type of service is the reason why I love Cameron Mitchell restaurants.I ordered the white tangerine tea, which is infused in its own cast iron pot and served in a tiny tea cup. The tea was very good, however the tea was too strong near the end of the pot (mostly my fault for letting it sit for too long). My boyfriend ordered a Sapporo.For appetizers I ordered Crab Rangoons (I simply love them). They were delicious; six small crab rangoon pouches. No unnecessary fried wonton, real crab meat, not super sweet. The sauce that accompanies was a zesty,  but I preferred them without the sauce. My boyfriend ordered a bowl of the wonton soup.For the main course I had the Cashew Chicken. The plate was big enough to feed two, with an overabundance of cashews. I would have liked a little more chicken because I felt that there were too many cashews and too much sauce, which overpowered the completed dish. I thought that the overall combination of ingredients was traditional to a cashew chicken dish and very delicious. My boyfriend ordered the Fircracker Chicken. This dish would've been perfect if it were spicier (but we choose our spice level so that was our own fault). The chicken was cooked perfectly and each piece was coated in the delectable sauce. I loved the thai chilies in the sauce. There were no survivors with this dish and we found it hard not to soak up the sauce in the rice and eat it all. Both of us ordered fried rice (a simple vegetable, fried rice).My leftover cashew chicken and rice was even better for lunch the following day :-)Ending check total: around $50, excluding tip. Total Time Elapsed (from the time that we entered the restaurant to when we paid the check): 25 minutes. Classy fast food.Final Recommendation: Good for lunch, too pricey for dinner; LOVE the Firecracker Chicken.",Ariatnia N.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,3,2007/10/8,"Molly Woo's Asian Bistro's location does it a service. It's located on the far north side at Polaris, where the mall shoppers don't know any better. It's atmosphere is much better than the average Asian restaurant, as is its food presentation. The flavors are average. Perhaps the draw is eating at a Cameron Mitchell restaurant -- the only Asian restaurant in its fleet of local eateries -- at an affordable price. Unlike other reviewers, the vegetarian friends I visited with found the restaurant to be very veg-friendly. Still, if I'm on the north side and craving Asian food, I'll visit Asian Gourmet at Morse and Hamilton. What is lost in ambiance is gained in taste.",Randy S.,,,,,,

Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,5,8/31/09,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!! Molly Woo's is one of the best asian restaurants in town!

The atmosphere, the waiters and the entire place is worth spending your money!!!",Karen W.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,3,12/30/08,"Indifferent and bored. That would be the best way to describe the food at Molly Woo's, which is really disappointing seeing as how Molly's Woo's is a Cameron Mitchell Joint.Oh, you'll be tempted to go inside, the decorations and atmosphere are fantastic! 5 stars for sure. Nothing says ""Chinese"" like RED, and Molly Woo's is covered in Martha Stewart's ""Commie Red"", which is totally in this season.The incredibly high ceilings and with paper lanterns, the back wall covered in Chinese ""artifacts"", these things all add to the aura of a mystical dining experience. But that's about where the magic ends and reality starts to set in when the appetizers come out.Now when you see Spring Rolls on the menu for $5.95, how many do you think you are getting? We guessed 4. We were wrong. 2 Spring Rolls for $5.95 = $2.98 a roll. Hm. We munched in silence but I know we were both thinking ""I hope this isn't a preview of what's to come"". That's not to say these Spring Rolls tasted bad, in fact they were quite good! But at almost $3 a roll, I felt a little shorted.Well next up was the main course. I ordered the Pineapple Chicken ($10.95) which I quickly learned meant ""Fancy name for Sweet & Sour Chicken"" and my boyfriend ordered Honey Chicken ($12.95). Both dishes come with your choice of fried, white, or brown rice. We both opted for fried. Now, the chicken was good in both dishes. Not grisly, not overly fried or doughy. Good quality chicken meat was used. But the dishes themselves were lacking any sort of style of flare. The Honey Chicken was supposed to be served in a ""spicy honey sauce"" but there was nothing spicy about it! Not even if you take into consideration the wimpy Americanized version of spicy that often gets served. There was nothing wrong with the portions served. Given the quality of ingredients and money paid I'd say that the portions were just right. But is it too much of me to expect something more from a Cameron Mitchell Joint? Where's the flare? The culinary expertise? That something special that sets Molly Woo's apart from any other Chinese sit down restaurant? Nothing. Nada. Not there. Other than the quality of ingredients used, there was nothing setting this meal apart than a meal at Number One Chinese. Except for the price.Well dessert picked up my mood a little as I ordered the Banana Spring Rolls. I'd say they were the most innovative thing on the menu! And delicious to boot.Overall we left feeling a little cheated out of a nice dining experience. Cameron, you're 1-2 with me. I think you owe me something special spectacular.",Lisa S.,,,,,,
Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,3,6/21/12,"Food was good but even spicy dishes are never very spicy. Service was great.

Molly Woo's Asian Bistro,139,3.5,3,7/25/09,"Having just relocated back to Columbus from New York after almost 20 years, I found myself looking for local restaurants. My girlfriend, who is Flipino badly needed a white rice fix, and my mom doesn't really like chinese, but sugested this place or the Lucky House in Westerville. Fearing the other choice may be the UNLucky House, we went here. Well, it was ok for what it was, a kind of New Pan-Asian cuisine. I had chicken that was fried with a spicy sauce. Can't actually remember the name of the dish, which isn't good. The food was OK, but nothing to write home about, the service was good (my normally penny pinching mom left 20%), and the decor was pretty good. I guess I would eat here again, but I prefer more of a homestyle place that specializes in one cuisine, like Shanghainese, for example. It wasn't awful, but it didn't leave a lasting impression. I would, however, go again, especially if someone else is paying the bill.",Trevor L.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,2012/3/17,"I think this might be one of my favorite restaurants of all time in Columbus.  Firstly, the atmosphere is classy but also casual; the vibe is similar to some of my favorite places in New York and Chicago  (I tend to shun formal/fussy restaurants).  And it is the only place where I can count on fresh, delicious oysters.  Better oysters than I've had on either coast, though I don't understand how that's possible.  How they do it, I do not know.But probably my favorite thing is the service.  Why is it that every time I visit The Pearl, I feel as though they have gotten advance notice that an important restaurant reviewer is there (incognito), and that they need to make everything the very best it can be?  As though they have been rehearsing for the night I come in (by some odd coincidence)?  This is typical of Cameron Mitchell restaurants,  but especially so at The Pearl.  I love this place.",Annie P.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,12/31/17,"I live one block from The Pearl and have only been here twice. I went for the first time about three years ago on a summer night. We had an excellent table right by the windows which were wide open so we got to sit there and enjoy the weather and peoplewatch. It was fantastic. Absolute 5/5 for atmosphere. I wasn't crazy about anything on the menu. I asked the server for his opinion and he recommended the Hanger Steak. I honestly didn't really like it (and I love steak and burgers so that's not good). I felt like it was a tad too spicy for my palate which made it unenjoyable (kind of frustrating since I asked the server if it was spicy and he said no.) To top it off, I got sick that night (not related to the food) so after being nauseous and whatnot I was never crazy about going back. But that was over three years ago and it is long overdue to give The Pearl a second chance! I had heard great things about their brunch so my friend and I went there while she was in town from Cali. Again, I absolutely loved the atmosphere. It's sophisticated, elegant  and a touch of hipster. What I loved was that my friend and I were sat in a booth and even though it was super busy and there was music playing, I could have a very simple conversation with her at normal volume. I swear I feel like any time I go to some of the High St restaurants I feel like I'm having to scream across the table because of loud music, clamoring plates, etc. Anyways I once again asked the server for recommendations (risky move given my last experience). He told me that the chicken and waffles were the number one choice by other customers followed by the Short Rib Poutine. I turned to Yelp to review pics and settled on the chicken and waffles although the poutine looked good as well! The chicken and waffles were great!! I know this sounds crazy but I've never actually had chicken & waffles before (hopefully admitting that doesn't get me kicked off of Yelp!). I always thought that the two flavors wouldn't mix well but I was obviously wrong. The chicken here had great flavor and a light coating mixed with various spices. It comes with blueberry syrup but I opted for regular maple syrup which was great. The waffle was light and fluffy; the perfect size as well! I was able to eat everything and feel comfortably full---the perfect amount of food! I would definitely like to go back to try the poutine for brunch and the fish and chips for lunch or dinner sometime. The atmosphere cannot be beat and I'm quickly finding that there are many great entree options to test out. I'll be back soon!",Chelsea E.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,12/15/17,"Consistently a great experience.I have ragged on this place so much for being an Oyster bar - in the middle of the MidWest. It just seems...åÊwell...åÊwrong.Plus, when Gordon Ramsay came, he ordered *the burger*.So I joked about *that*. But that burger...åÊlooked tasty.So I've come here for brunch multiple times. And been blown away. I've come here for dinner a couple times. And been blown away (by their appetizers - deviled eggs are delicious! - their entrees, and their desserts!)

The Pearl,578,4,4,2012/3/17,"Four stars and two thumbs up for The Pearl - by far my favorite of the Cameron Mitchell spots I've tried. One glance at the menu with its creative, upscale spin on southern comfort food classics, and I was sold.I've dined several times with friends and have never left disappointed or hungry. The jalapeÌ±o corn spoon bread is my favorite of the starters I've tried - it's served sizzling in cast iron with creamy whipped butter dollops sitting and melting over the top (there's honey too). It melts in your mouth and hits all the right notes of salt, sweet, and spice. I've tried the clam chowder too but found it underwhelming with far too few discernible hunks of clam to be worth the price. Good flavor though.For my entree, every time I've dined, I've gone with the shrimp & grits. The Gouda grits have always been spot on - perfectly creamy and well-seasoned. The poblano pepper lends a mild heat and great smokiness to the dish, a welcome addition to this classic southern staple. It's my absolute favorite dish to order wherever I can find it, so I consider myself a bit of an expert when it comes to shrimp & grits, and The Pearl's version does not disappoint. Kielbasa is not my favorite, but it works well with the poblano and cheesiness of the grits. I'm yet to receive subpar shrimp - they've been plump and cooked well each time.The Pearl has a beautiful and stylish interior. At night, it's positively dazzling. Service is just fine, and the experience is always satisfactory or better! It's a reliable Short North star!",Marisa B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,11/14/17,"This may become one of my favorite happy hour spots in the Short North, and it may be my favorite Cameron Mitchell restaurant. It's an oyster bar, and it's 110% that and everything else it wants to be.The vibe is NYC/San Fran young, hip oyster bar - the lighting, the industrial/warehouse decor, the separation of the various seating areas - all matched with appropriately loud techno-remixed pop music. My kind of vibe for happy hour.Service was good, well-timed for enjoyment of drinks, appetizer(s), and entree. The happy hour prices and menu are crazy-good, and includes cocktails, wine, beer, starters, appetizers, AND sandwiches. That's half-off the food, you all. Including the charcuterie board ($24 full-price).Our meal was a three beers, a board (because yes, please), jalapeno spoon bread (on the house since they missed it on the order), a Cuban sandwich and their fried chicken. I know, I'm getting oysters next time.The charcuterie board was a selection of meats and spreads, plus a giant pile of the house-made pickles. Would order again for happy hour. The spoon bread was exactly that, served with butter and honey. Good, but had I realized the fried chicken came with a cinnamon roll, I'd have skipped it. Cuban was awesome-awesome the next day for lunch - no need to even reheat. Bursting with flavor, etc. The side of black beans was a keeper, too. The spouse had the fried chicken and damn, that is some GOOD fried chicken. Plus a cinnamon roll. And green bean casserole. HECK YEAH.Sadly, dessert was a no-go. I took all but three bites of my sandwich home with me. Regrets, I have them. Will rectify on the next visit.ANYWAY. Check = $53 for the whole shebang. Three drinks, one app, two entrees.

The Pearl,578,4,3,2011/7/17,"I never plan on ending up at The Pearl, but often do, mostly for the fresh seafood and quality cooking.I should probably plan to visit The Pearl in advance, but I don't. So in the 3-4 times that I've eaten there, I've always ended up at the bar. Typically, I love the bar -- easy access to the second most important component of a meal. I've also always wondered why more people don't eat at The Pearl's bar and found out the hard way why they don't.What subtracts from any bar's appeal (and why people will choose not to eat at one) is a bar staff that often neglects and acts more important than its customers, and that's consistently what you'll find at The Pearl.The Pearl's bar is like a boat's 'brig' (cell), a punishment for guests who haven't made a reservation. Its head bartender is the warden. Empty drinks often sit without refills, which are not necessarily offered. Rather, refills require your plea. Want a water? Good luck. It doesn't matter if you're having a single beer or a full $200 meal for two -- you'll have to negotiate and conjure excuses to get one. Not acceptable at these prices: water should be served standard with no customer effort required.Beyond that, and despite the incredibly hackneyed decor and overplayed 'gastropub' theme, the food at The Pearl is often quite good. Fresh oysters from across the country offer great variety of size, flavor and texture, though the cleaning of each leaves something to be desired -- you'll frequently find yourself picking pieces of sand and shell from your mouth, a minor criticism and small price to pay for a rare Columbus commodity. Seafood entree specials offer balanced cooking and refreshing restraint of technique. I've had better seafood dishes at The Pearl than at any other seafood restaurant in Columbus.In short, if you want great seafood in Columbus, plan ahead and book at table at The Pearl. If you don't and still end up there, I'll save you a seat at the bar along with the other castaways, where you can fend for yourself.",Malcolm K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,7/18/17,"A great gastropub type place! First off get here soon enough to just take in the vibe... laid back true all wood bar with that pub feel... Excellent.Have a drink... lots of specialty beers on tap or in bottles. I recommend the porter or the x2 milk stout! Fabulous Rich dark beers that you almost have to chew to get down... yummmmm!Then be sure to try their tots and their bacon wrapped dates... sinful...just completely sinful! (Don't fall for the bucket of pickles line... it is really no more then a saucer of bread and butter chunks) I moved from this to the chorizo dusted clam chowder... I love clam chowder.. I mean as far as soups go this was manna from heaven. It was spicy, filled with clams and in a buttery cream base. Divine!For my main course I had the Cuban sandwich. The bread was a bit hard and cut up my mouth some... but the flavor was pure pleasure. Pain and pleasure... ... what a sandwich!!my friends had the shark and the shrimp and grits... there was nothing left on their plates.For desert we had the Boston Cream Pie... it fell way short of the rest of the food... not at all what I expected after eating everything else.However the server was awesome!

The Pearl,578,4,4,7/15/17,"This place came highly recommended to me since it's hard to find good oysters inland. My wife loves them and I took her here for her birthday. Prices were high but reasonable. We came for happy hour because it's half off starters, sandwiches and sides. Some drinks were also included but not all so make to ask! Our waiter was Charlie and he was very good and good looking! The staff all looked to the 9's and great atmosphere here for date night or grabbing quick drink. Great decor and plenty of bathrooms!Location is prime and parking structure was not that hard to find with only having to pay $5. Since it was her birthday, they even gave her complimentary dessert which of course she LOVED.  Only reason I docked them was that I ordered a steak medium rare and it was a lot more rare than I prefer so I ended up taking it home and cooking it more. The only minus was how salty it was.",Jess C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,5/15/17,"As a fresh seafood fanatic, this is one of my go to places in Columbus.  The place has one of the freshest oyster selections I have experienced in Ohio.  If you love fresh oysters, this is the place to go.  Their mains and sides are also very good.  The restaurant itself is smack dab in the middle of the short north district.  There is convenient valet parking right on front for 8 dollars.  As this restaurant typically takes a bit to get a seat, there are great options on the street to get a drink while waiting (just hold off on the jenni's ice cream till after dinner!).The restaurant was kind enough give us an earlier reservation time as we arrived a bit early and we ended up getting seated close to the time provided.  The environment was great inside, however, was a bit close to the kitchen door.As noted before, the oysters were spectacular.  Recommendation would be the East cost Delaware bay oysters - great flavor and definitely fresh.  We also ordered the west coast, but those did not seem as fresh as the east coast option.Ordered the deviled eggs and bacon wrapped dates as well - both were great and would recommend as a small appetizer to share.  We also ordered the teriyaki octopus- it was above average and could have used a bit more crispness.For mains, we ordered a mix of the Great Lakes fried perch, fried chicken platter, braised short rib, and the hanger steak.  The winner is short rib by far - it was very tender and had great flavor.   Great pairing with the appetizers.  Fried chicken and the fried perch was average.  Hangar steak was cooked well, but slightly too salty.Wrapped up the meal with the recommended pie - it was fabulous and worthy of the praise.  Scoop of ice cream on top would have been perfect!Only negative I have is was the wait time.  It took 30-40 minutes to bring the appetizer and then another 30 or so to bring the main entrees.  When we ordered additional oysters, it did not arrive till after the meal.  Note that the restaurant did give us the oysters on the house which was much appreciated.All in all - great seafood establishment in Columbus short north.  I will be back!",Stephen C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2009/3/17,"We come to Columbus once a year for a Labor Day getaway and we have been coming to The Pearl since it first opened. When it first opened we had just incredible service and the oysters were very exotic, and it seemed less frantic and less like a chain.Now, the food is still excellent, but the oysters seem like more of an after thought and the wait staff is just ok. It seems just a hair overcrowded because they put the tables so close to each other. I requested a booth in the bar when I made my reservation, but did not get it. I was willing to wait but they sat us in an area that is overcrowded.Our waiter was just ok. He didn't know what the oysters were, and then the person who delivered the oysters to our table named the oysters to us wrong. Then, the waiter came back and said ""he don't know what he's talking about"".It's just too expensive for people to usher you in and out without exceptional care on where you sit, how they approach you and the service they present.

I'm not too big into the Kimchee fried rice either. But the meat was tender! I don't think the restaurant is at fault here; I just think my flavor palette leans towards more traditional American food, and this dish had an international spin to it!The brown sugar butter pie for dessert is incredible. It melts in your mouth and is to die for! I think I'll be dreaming about it tonight! Overall, I love this place and will be back. And next time I intend to try the fried chicken that my friend said was awesome!",Danielle S.,,,,,,

They were just ok. There should be a little more light for folks that have trouble reading. Even with reservations, we ended up will a really small table.

The Pearl,578,4,5,2012/11/17,"One of my favorite restaurants in Columbus. My mother and I used to come here twice a month for dinner. They have great snacks. Their tater tots, fries, and deviled eggs are a few of my favorites. The cornbread is amazing. I order it every time I go. I have not had anything on he menu I haven't liked. I'm not a fan of oysters but, their fried oysters are the only time I eat them.",Iris T.,,,,,,

And their happy hour is really ridiculously priced. Their mixed drinks are a little on the meh side, but it's my absolute favorite restaurant for food in town.

The Pearl,578,4,4,2011/10/16,"I went to The Pearl for the first time last weekend with a bunch of friends for brunch. It was a game day, so the restaurant was pretty packed. My group had a reservation and because one table was taking super long to leave, it took a while to get us seated. The employees at The Pearl were quite apologetic and accommodating about the whole thing, which was nice. The general ambience of The Pearl is...interesting. There's a lot of mason jar type stuff going on, which always makes me raise my eyebrows a little bit. And they bring out receipts in books, which seems like a possible recipe for disaster to me (and certainly some of the stuff people had written/drawn in some of the books was as sophomoric as you might expect). Nevertheless, the experience was pretty good overall. I had the short rib poutine for my meal, and it was delicious. My only quibble would be on the low amount of short rib provided (especially since that was the tastiest part). Our server was very pleasant and always kept my cup of coffee full, which is something I always appreciate.",Jacinta Y.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,2011/11/17,"The Pearl has very good food. My boyfriend and I got the hanger steak, which was delicious. However, i reheated my leftovers and found some kind of metal piece in it. Not happy!Also, the server we had was very inattentive. Took 20 minutes to get water, boyfriends food was cold and server never came over to ask if it was okay. We went on our anniversary and was very disappointed. Probably wont be back. Other Cameron Mitchell restaurants like Marcellas and Molly Woos are much MUCH better service.",Jenny H.,,,,,,

The other bar patrons seemed to really be enjoying the handcrafted unique cocktails, unfortunately I didn't feel up to getting a drink(was feeling like passing out at the bar after my busy travel schedule that week) but will be back to try several the next time I find myself in Columbus.",Bry M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,6/18/17,"My friend and I got here around 7:15 on a Saturday and lucky enough to find seats at the bar (make a reservation!) It took a bit to get acknowledged but as soon as we did, we got an apology and the service from there on our was great! Our server was friendly and checked on us multiple times. We ordered the deviled eggs to share and they were delicious and had a fun presentation. She got the skirt steak with the egg and kimchi and I got baked clams and fries on the side. Our food was delicious and we ate everything. I've also been here before and gotten the steak. This place is a must try! Both times I enjoyed the food and service.",Mai L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,9/13/17,"Food was good but experience/service could have been better. I went on a Sunday evening so it was not too busy and ordered the shellfish tower which includes oysters, clams, shrimp, and crab for $90. The waiter came back saying the shrimp was not available but it could be substituted with oysters or crab. Although not the most ideal I settled with more crab. Then when the appetizers came up the waiter told us the kitchen had mixed up and the shrimp was available, which got me excited. Then when our tower came, the waiter told us the kitchen counted wrong and there was actually no shrimp for our tower but they put in more crab instead. This back and forth was at best a miscommunication and at worst a lack of organization skills... how hard is it to figure out how many shrimp are available and if there's enough for a table?? For a higher end place I found that annoying. On a super busy night it may be more understandable but it was fairly empty when we arrived. The waiter was probably just passing messages from the kitchen, but somewhere along the way they screwed up multiple times. Although the oysters were great and corn bread was wonderful, the back and forth really didn't allow for the experience to be the best it could be.",Grace L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,5/16/17,"I have changed my mind.Skeptical about the oysters after the first experience but I have returned a few times since and think the oysters are pretty good!

The Pearl,578,4,5,9/21/17,"I'm feeling a little like a broken record here....... why can they not have places like this in Augusta? Le sigh. Oh well, I will be back in Columbus and hope to come back here to try more and for their happy hour at some point. Long story short, my sister and I were doing a play on words to celebrate every anniversary for my parents up to their 40th. This was the place we chose for their 30th anniversary (the gift is a pearl for those who have no idea what I'm talking about). My sister had been here in the past and knew that she wanted everyone to try the Devils on Horseback (bacon-wrapped dates), Peel & Eat Shrimp and Chicken & Waffles. We were going to do oysters but decided against. Don't worry......we will be back to try them. I was surprised at how much I liked the Devils on Horseback seeing as I'm not a fan of dates and am not in LOVE with bacon. I would absolutely order those again. The blueberry compote that was served with the Chicken & Waffles was droolworthy. The Peel & Eat Shrimp were HUGE and the cocktail sauce served with them hit the spot. We all ordered drinks too and loved them. I appreciated the way the Bloody Mary was served because I've never seen it served that way and I've ordered them in several places. They had a little skewer of goodies on it, but also served with a 4 oz Miller High Life. I tried the Ramos Gin Fizz and that may be my new favorite drink. It was perfect. I loved the decor in the place, as well. Also, mouthwash in the bathroom? Who would have ever thought of that? I love it.",Brittany B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,3/28/17,"If you want fresh oysters this is the place! They have very fresh oysters from a few different locations in the U.S. so it can vary where your oysters come from. The servers are very knowledgeable about the differences in the oysters so just ask! I prefer them raw but they have baked as well!The bloody Mary's are pretty good, they will also bring you a little miller lite with it too! The other drinks are good, balance of alcohol to mixer are on point.Try the Devils on horseback. Goodness. They are tasty. The cornbread was very good as well. Get the braised short rib too, tender and juicy and everything you want from a short rib.The atmosphere is super cool and I love the look of this restaurant.

The Pearl,578,4,3,2/24/17,"I have very mixed feelings about The Pearl. The concept is wonderful- Cameron Mitchell really thought this one through. It's a great mix of Southern cooking and the oysters that so many (fancy) people adore. That's great. But the execution of some of these foods comes off as odd, and in Columbus, I'm not sure it's really what people are looking for.SIDE NOTE: the happy hour is amazing because things cost literally half of their normal price. If that was the case all the time, then 5 stars! But currently it's only 4-6 M-F.I have been to the Pearl for both dinner and brunch, but I was there for brunch most recently so I'm going to comment on that. I will start by saying our server was great and very prompt in coming back to the table to check on us, so no complaints there. But the drink prices alone for brunch are $10-$12, entrees are $12-$25, and they don't serve bread or anything before the meal, so my starving self ordered some pancakes to start things off too, which was $6 each split between 2 people. Now, I would be less harsh about these prices if the portion sizes were better, but I personally ate 1.5 meals at brunch and I wasn't particularly stuffed. For my entree, I ordered the eggs and grits, and I was not disappointed with the flavor. Rich, cheesy grits with poached eggs and green onions/celery on top. It was also strangely served with these tiny pieces of cornbread, and a container of molasses, I guess for dipping the cornbread? I didn't really understand that part. A friend ordered the huevos rancheros and it was maybe 8 oz. of food plus a tortilla. Not really enough food, or worth $16. They also offer a short rib poutine which had amazing flavor, complete with a fried egg on top, but it was about $15 for a single serving of fries coated in gravy with an egg. I'm not seeing the value for the cost. Also it is very dark inside the restaurant, especially if you're near the back, so it's not the best place to enjoy a bright and airy mid-day brunch. Overall, it is a good concept, and if you're willing to spend a bunch of money then it can be a good experience, but it is not my favorite brunch spot in the Short North.",Gina M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2011/6/17,One of my favorite brunch spots!! I always seem to get the same thing - short rib poutine. The egg on top of all the gooeyness really makes it.

I attacked my dish and if I could have licked the plate I would have, but my mom taught me to have manners in public  : )) Seriously, I can't say enough about the Sunday Brunch at The Pearl, wonderful and over the top, great place to go for happy hours with that special person or just casual date night....get to The Pearl and enjoy folks!!",Chris C.,,,,,,

Everything at The Pearl is excellent. We drank, we ate, and we were oh so very merry!First of all, they have some kickass bloody Mary's. Like...wow. And they serve it with salami, a pickle, an olive, and...Miller High Life. We shared the charcuterie platter and let me tell you, as two Jews from New York, the liver was EXCELLENT. We also had the peel and eat gulf shrimp, and my friend is originally from the south so she's very critical of her shellfish, and she said these shrimp were awesome. For the entree we decided to change it up a bit so we shared the ricotta dumplings. Wow, just wow.Everything is great, even our server was amazing (shoutout to Eric!).

The Pearl,578,4,3,2002/4/17,"I recently chose The Pearl for a group (6 people) work dinner and I was very underwhelmed. It was a cold Tuesday evening in January, and despite the fact that we had reservations, we still had to wait 20 minutes for our table, beyond the reservation time. One of our party ordered salmon and it was horribly undercooked, so she sent it back. When they brought it out a second time, it was equally as raw! When she sent it back a second time the server gave her a little attitude and said ""Well did you want this cooked well done? Salmon is served medium rare."" I order salmon at restaurants all the time and I have never been served salmon as raw as it was on her plate. They did get her meal right the 3rd time, but by the time they brought the 3rd plate out, the rest of us were finished eating. I had ordered a different salmon dish and was just counting my lucky stars that my fish was thoroughly cooked when I hit the middle and it was more undercooked than I'm used to, so I didn't finish my meal. Due to the seating delay and the 2 salmon plates we sent back, our dinner lasted much later than anticipated. I'm disappointed because I've always heard great things about The Pearl and I LOVE seafood. I doubt I'll return.",Sarah T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2011/12/17,"This was an amazing American restaurant. We did not have any seafood, but no doubt it is as good as what we had. I definitely would come back for dinner or recommend this restaurant.",Robin N.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,10/30/17,"On weekends (and maybe other days) it's good to make reservations ahead of time. Everything here was great. We started with the Devils on Horseback and Tater Tots. I really don't know what was inside the DoH, but it was bacon wrapped goodness. The tater tots were a creamy mashed potato-like mixture with a thin but crisp outer shell like a tater tot. They were simply awesome and came with a dipping sauce. The cocktails are real cocktails, not just a mixture of ingredients. They taste as they're described and are very good/interesting combinations. I had the Shrimp & Grits. It's a thinner type of red sauce and was very good. Other dishes looked equally as good. Happy hour has half priced appetizers and drinks. Well worth the early arrival. The atmosphere is unique and has an open kitchen.  I'll definitely be back.",Jesse H.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,11/27/16,"Our first visit to this restaurant. Went on a Thu evening and the place was hopping. Good thing we made reservations and were taken to our table immediately. The server was extremely polite and professional. The ambience is modern and nice. It was loud but not enough to impair a conversation. Their wine selection is quite good. My wife ordered a merlot and I got their  house Cabernet, both were  pretty decent. For appetizers we had a half dozen oysters, most of them were very good (not top restaurant east coast good, but  good nonetheless). The clam chowder was surprisingly delicious, and this is from someone who recently came returned from a trip to Boston. The spinach salad was only so so. I'd recommend against ordering it. Their market special of the day was a fresh walleye, which was prepared very well. The one omission was that they did not include bread with the meal. We were told that the restaurant does not offer complimentary bread so we ordered a baguette, which was okay. All in all a nice evening. I'd probably come back to try their other offerings.",Ness S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2010/12/17,"I love going to the Pearl when I have a craving for oysters! I actually got a chance to check it out during happy hour which they have an excellent selection of! I couldn't sit at my usual spot and couldn't have the same waiter (love him and his energy and attitude but i dont know his name.. he is in the back area!) so my friend and i sat at the oyster bar. If you are sensitive to smell I don't recommend sitting there because the smell of oysters will get to you. I was fine but my friend did mention it a few times. Ordered the rockpoint, blue point, and the chesapeake oysters! I think the rock point is my favorite. Very smooth and not too salty. The brie grilled cheese sandwich is good but maybe too cheesy for you so the arugula salad really balanced it out. My friend got the board of cheese and meats and she enjoyed it thoroughly. Although she mentioned the pickles almost masked the flavor of everything else. The beets salad was so good, although it might have been better if the veggies were a bit colder. Tasted lukewarm and the avocado were brown. The waiters were all over the place so we had to deal with three waiters to get things in or our checks. Water wasnt refilled as fast either. That oyster bar section was pretty ... inconvenient.",Minna C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,2006/3/17,"Long term patron of Pearl.  After the waiter highly recommended a poached egg breakfast special he couldn't pronounce(chilaquiles), we decided to go with his recommendation. He came back with the special with poached eggs hard cooked and cold. After politely asking him to return the special and if possible bring us freshly poached eggs, the waiter walked away from us mid-sentence. Have you ever experienced something so incredibly humiliating at a restaurant?  At any rate, we spoke to the manager, who to his credit, offered his apologies and to comp us for our meal.  The experience was so bizarre and upsetting we decided to leave and, of course, never to come back. Oh, Pearl - you break our hearts... Perhaps googling ""how to poach an egg"" for the kitchen staff and googling ""how to politely speak to a customer"" for the waiting staff would be in order.",Val B.,,,,,,

Happy service. But, none of the food really stood out to me - everything we had - and we had a lot, was shared and enjoyable, but after heading home, I can't really think of anything that I would go back to this restaurant for.That's not to say I would not return - I absolutely would.

The Pearl,578,4,5,2012/1/16,"Wow, this was the best meal I've had in a long time.  I had the hanger steak, which was juicy and tender on a flavorful bed of fried rice and topped with a runny fried egg.  I've never had this particular combination before, but it was wonderful.  Good portion size too.  My wife had the short rib and horseradish mashed potatoes, which was also fantastic.  While these are close to $30, which is more than I'd probably spend on the typical night out, these were not typical meals.  Delicious food, and lots of it.  Well worth the cost.Nice drink menu.  There are a number of cocktails that sound great.  The Manhattan was one of the better Manhattans I've had in awhile.  The Peanut Butter and Pearl Jam was surprisingly good.  There's also a strong beer list featuring quite a few Belgian selections.Attentive, friendly service.  Nice atmosphere.  It was busy, but didn't feel crowded or too loud.  Beautiful, elegant space.Highly recommended.",Doug O.,,,,,,

We had shimp and grits & hanger steak with eggs. Menu was somewhat limited.  My friend enjoyed steak with eggs. I had a bite of that meat was very nicely cooked. My shrimp with Grits was okay, but grits did not have much taste to it. I took brown sugar pie with cream to take back. That pie was awesome, it was extremely tasty. I would recommend it. If I am in the town again, I would go back there. They did not gave any bread or anything to start with. What you order is what you get.",Thomas L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2010/6/17,"The Pearl was a perfect start to a nice, long-weekend, semi-staycation.  Ever been to a place with amazing, gourmet food, high-end beer and wine, perfect service, AND a casual atmosphere where you could rock a sweatshirt and chucks?  This is one of those places.  I can't even begin to list all the stuff the three of us had to eat...but it was all perfect.",Tina Y.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2006/8/17,"Came here for the happy hour. Prices were fair for the oysters and the drinks. $5 moscow mules! Select appetizers were also half off during this time. The charcuterie plate was an interesting experience. Not a fan of their caviar mustard, but it was cool to try so many different meats and spreads. Not worth it if it was not happy hour. I am happy with the $2 oysters during happy hour. That was the highlight of the meal as they were fresh and tasty. This place is quite romantic with the lighting and atmosphere and they have funny dog paintings hung up in the restrooms. Overall a little pricey and worth a visit during happy hour for the oysters!",Thien-Nam T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,9/26/16,"I romanticize The Pearl. I tell all my friends it's my favorite brunch spot. Then, when I finally do get there, I remember, I just really love their Bloody Mary's!! C'mon they come with a mini bottle of Miller high life. The Devils on horseback: bacon wrapped dates with a garlic, cilantro drizzle. Yum!! I had the salmon which is a starter but, a huge portion of perfectly poached salmon with a caper lemon sauce and one perfect deviled egg. I love it!The hanger steak would be so much better if it was served with something other than ginger, soy- ish rice. It does have great flavor, just too much, it overpowers the dish and you really can't enjoy the steak.Everything is plated, arranged and served to please, not just the taste buds, but the eyes.",Eliah T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2007/11/17,"I love this place. Great atmosphere and great food.  The drinks come fast and you can get a seat at the bar if you wait in the right place. For starters they have the best deviled eggs and tater tots.  Do that.  You will be satisfied. I have got the hanger steak all 3 times and will get again. An Asian slant and a fried egg.  It is perfect if medium rare. This is a great place for you and that special someone to have dinner out in the short north.",Michael T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,9/15/17,"Don't mess around.  Get the burger or the short ribs.  You won't be disappointed, especially if you have an appetite.  Good atmosphere and great place to cost in the summer.  Food is served fast even when crowded.",Todd B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2003/1/16,"I've kind of been putting off writing this review because I wish my review was better than just 3 stars! I made a reservation for a Friday dinner here. The entrance was pretty crowded, but we were greeted and seated in 5 min. My date and I both ordered Moscow mule's, I wasn't crazy about mine - I think it tasted like 95% ginger beer. We went ahead and ordered our entire meal at once so we could just talk and relax. We ordered baked clams, ricotta dumplings, and the special of the night which was some sort of seafood Thai curry. Our food didn't take too long to come out - but our entrees came out before our baked clams :( our server swung by and apologized, letting us know that the baked clams would be on the house. The ricotta dumplings were good, but I wasn't a huge fan, and the portions were mediocre. The seafood Thai curry was spicy!! and we both liked it - but again, not a very good value (I think it was $30+). The star of the night was definitely the baked clams. Serving situation was kind of mixed - a lot of attention to random details - our candle went out and he came by to light it probably 30 seconds after... but not too much attention otherwise. Also when he came to deliver the check at the end of the night, he forgot to take the baked clams off... which felt kind of awkward and we were just preparing to pay for them... until he came back to pick up the credit card and remembered.  I have a big sweet tooth and since we were enjoying a nice night out we ordered the banana cream pie - ugh it was not very good, and definitely not worth the $6-7. We had a great time and a nice meal that i kind of wished I loved, but I'd say it was not worth the $$$. I'm not too interested in returning, but I'm sure my arm could be twisted for happy hour and baked clams/oysters.",Rosalie W.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,4/25/17,"The food isn't anything special. The oysters were ridiculously overpriced...about $2 an oyster. I got a truffle pasta, and the portions were small, especially for the price. Probably won't be back unless someone else is treating.",Eric T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,10/14/17,I have been here more times than I can count but I can say this place is not up to par for Cameron Mitchell.  For starters my son received undercooked fried chicken that was still bloody.  My husband ordered attic char and received salmon and our appetizer never came.  I am very disappointed especially since I have been here so many times and had a great experience.  There are many other options on high street with the Cameron Mitchell name that I would choose over the pearl.,Jennifer S.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,2008/1/17,"Oh man, I really got myself hyped up for this place.  I've always had this place of my radar for many years, well ever since it was put in.  I mentioned something to a good friend about always wanting to check this place out, and so it happened, we made it happen.  Reservations set for 8pm on a Monday night, hoping it wouldn't be too crazy for an area that always seems busy for great food.I usually don't order a lot of food, but tonight I was planning on trying a lot and may have spent way more money than I normally would, but in the end, I planned for it, this was a night out to spoil ourselves and we most certainly did.Valet was key, I would highly recommend taking advantage of it in this area.  I usually take one trip around the block for a open spot, and if nothing is available I go straight to the Valet, it certain cases like this, it's money well spent.Ok, enough of how we ended up here and lets get straight to the food.Starters and Apps:1. House made tater tots, you get a good amount and these were really good.  Fried potatoes on a menu isn't really too fancy, but these were incredible.  I'm still curios how they manage to get silky mashed potatoes fried up in a cube. Best value for money.2.  Lamb meatballs, a must get item!!  These were the best things I had for the night.  Only comes with three, so at $3/piece it's a little pricey, but mmmmmm mmmmm! Very good!3.  Old fashioned devil eggs, I wouldn't order this again.  Not because it was bad, they were good, but to me, I learned devil eggs are kind of like those food items where you really only like the version you grew up with because nothing else can compare.  It came with 4 so at $2/piece, which I also found to be a little pricey for what you're getting.4.  Devils on horseback, another really good item that came with about 5 pieces to share.  I pretty much like anything that's thick bacon wrapped, and these were very good.5.  Jalapeno corn spoon bread, this was really good too.  Even for a friend who doesn't like cornbread, he said to remove the dish because he was going to eat it all and not share with anyone.  Smother the honey and butter over the top and dig right in, this was yummy!Raw Oysters, they have several locals to choose from.  I can't vouch for how they taste as I'm not into raw oysters or anything that I find very salty, but my friends enjoyed what they got.Mains:Southern fried chicken, this was a good dish, nicely breaded thick pieces of chicken friend with a good spicy sauce on the side if you want to add some.  Like every sticky bun I've had, excellent!  and the green bean casserole was tasty, I wish more came with the dish.Cuban sandwich, good tasting pork and some great bread.  Nothing else to really say, but it's a good sandwich that they offer.Catch of the Day, this evening it was blackened perch with lump crab meat.  It was very good.  Fresh seafood with some chunky crab? YES please!!So we ended our night without any pie, so maybe next time.  Our server was great, she was on top of getting things cleared without being intrusive while doing it and the cocktails were all really good and well made.  Another CM place that I'm impressed with.",Taylor O.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2008/5/16,"My first time at The Pearl was awesome! This retro joint is located downtown on High Street in the middle of Short North.Parking is ample. If you can't find a spot on the street, there's a parking garage right around the corner.The ambiance is a dimly lit, casual oyster bar. I recommend sitting at the oyster bar and watching the oyster shucking.I took the advice of fellow helpers and ordered the jalapeÌ±o bread - boy was I glad I did! The baked and fresh oysters were spot on! The Beet Soup was like nothing I've ever tasted - delicious!I already miss you, Pearl!",Jennifer D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2009/11/17,"We ate brunch at The Pearl based on a recommendation from another friend that was visiting Columbus as well. We ordered coffee, a bloody mary, The Benny and eggs and grits. The Bloody Mary (spicy) was the perfect consistency and spiciness for my tastes. The Benny serving was large - I had asked for the gravy on the side and I think that was a good idea. Grits were delicious too. Window dining seat and the laid-back, but conscious service complemented our food for brunch.",Allison B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,4/29/17,My wife got the Brie grilled cheese sandwich and it was amazing. I shared the flank steak with a Kimche rice and it was fabulous! To start off we had the cornbread which everyone raved about for good reason. At first I thought the cornbread was just ok but by the second bite I thought it was good and the third bite just melted in my mouth. The honey butter made it go over the top.,Jeff J.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,6/13/17,"We're total foodies, and The Pearl did not disappoint! We will be back.The staff was incredible - very friendly, very knowledgeable, and the food was so good.

The Pearl,578,4,2,2010/8/17,"I wish I could resonate with the high reviews people give this place, but I can't. My husband and I visited Columbus over the weekend and decided to come here for our dinner. First of all, everything takes an extremely long time so don't plan to be anywhere after your meal that has a set time.We ordered the duck fat wings and the n'awlins hot oysters for starters. Wings were decent but the oysters were very bland. Despite the cheese and visible seasonings, they had no flavor whatsoever. At $14 for just three of them, that's disappointing. Came with a piece of bread and I have to say the bread was better than the oysters.The server raved about the entrees and their drinks. I mean realllllly raved! Thus, I ordered a margarita as he said it had a kick and was ""in your face"" strong. Negative. It came in a tiny glass and tasted like salt. For our meals I had the shrimp and grits and hubby had the burger which the server said would be the best burger my husband had all year. Another lie. My husband didn't even finish it as it had no flavor. He said it wasn't good at all. My shrimp and grits were a very small portion, and the grits were very lumpy. Broth was decent with the onions and peppers with the shrimp, but the foundation of the dish (grits) were a miss, so I couldn't enjoy.Skip The Pearl. Everyone moves in slow motion and the food isn't up to par in my opinion. Won't be back.",Lola L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2010/8/17,"Food - 5 stars, everything the four of had was deliciousService - 4 stars, good but not greatValue - 3 stars, overpriced for what you get ($9 for three one inch wide lamb meatballs, $10 for a small cocktail, $160 brunch for four with four cocktails and one dessert). The lack of value is the norm with Cameron Mitchell restaurants. Ambiance - 3 stars, unless you like the vibe of extremely loud and tables crowded together. We were in a booth and it was so loud the that waiter could not hear the orders from the people sitting against the wall, nor could they hear him. We have been there three times, and these themes are consistent. I am sure we will go there again in a year or so, but will frequent higher value peer restaurants more often in the meantime.",John T.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,7/27/16,"My husband and I were looking for a restaurant in Short North that: A. we both had never been to, B. Wasn't too fancy/$$$, and C. Wasn't a no-frills bar & grill.  We settled on The Pearl and we're both pretty happy we did.We went on a Wednesday after 9pm and the place was still pretty full of folks, which is a good sign in my book.We were quickly seated and had drinks in hand within 5 minutes.The first thing my husband says to me is ""this restaurant has a lot of good looking people working here"".  Yes, it's true.  The hosts/esses, wait staff, bartenders, even the cooks are all very attractive so you get some dinner eye candy. Drinks aren't too expensive and you have a lot to choose from.Most importantly, the food was amazing. My husband's order of fish & chips was huuuuuge and he really liked it. My Arctic char was delicious. The roasted cauliflower really went well with the fish. I can see The Pearl becoming a regular stop for us.",Deniece L.,,,,,,

The cocktails are always delicious, I'm a huge fan of the Ramos Gin Fizz and my husband loves the Old Fashioned. We contemplated ordering the seafood tower but decided to just order our favorites individually. We started with a dozen oysters, then had some peel and eat shrimp. To finish the meal we ordered the New Orleans style oysters!

The Pearl,578,4,5,10/20/15,"Really nice place in the heart of the Short North with a lot of menu items that you wouldn't see just anywhere.  I got to try my first oysters this weekend when my girlfriend and I went for a late dinner with some friends.We started out with jalapeÌ±o corn bread, which was SO good!  There was just the right amount of jalapeÌ±o kick without it being overpowering, and the presentation on the wood plank was cool too.  My only complaint here was that the honey was inside of the dollop of butter on the wood plank, with no cup around it, so when I took some of the butter to put on my bread, the honey ran out and over the plank (whatever, not a big deal).A few people in our group had the Moscow Mule; very flavorful and in a nice copper cup.  $10 each if I remember correctly, a little pricey to me, but it was a special occasion so no big deal.My girlfriend had the ricotta dumplings and I had the hanger steak (medium rare).  The steak comes out plated very beautifully, and was very flavorful.  You can tell when a steak is cooked perfectly when you don't feel the need for any extra sauces.  There was some added flavor from the kimchee, but that steak would have been delicious even without.Our server was extremely attentive and took outstanding care of us all night long.  As a table, we ordered a slice of each of the four types of pies that they have at The Pearl (key lime, apple, a house special, and a chocolate).  We split these all up, and every one of them was great.  I definitely recommend The Pearl if you're looking for a nice evening out.",Greg W.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2006/2/16,"Dinner here was surprisingly good! We met out of town friends here for dinner as it was highly rated and offered a great variety for our group that ranged in ages from 4, 17 to 50.We made it in time for happy hour which ended at 6 and I am so glad we did! Half priced drinks and small plates plus $1.50 oysters offered a great discount off the menu prices.Standout items were the baked oysters, confit chicken (chicken wings), spinach salad and all the pies! We had the Brown Sugar Pie, Billionaire Pie al a mode and Frozen Strawberry Pie.  I was definitely glad we saved room for dessert as that was the highlight to me!I would certainly eat here again and make it a point to be there in time for Happy Hour.",Rye W.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,9/24/16,"Been to the Pearl several times and I must say, it is one of my favorite restaurants in Columbus, Ohio.  Situated in the heart of the 'up and booming Short North', this gastropub is already set up for success. The restaurant is always packed, the table proximity, and low lighting gives in to that feeling. The menu is pretty simple. Some carefully selected and well made starters like deviled eggs begs you to move on to the snack items like the house smoked salmon with guess what, another deviled egg served on the side.  But don't stop there, get the  jalapeÌ±o spoon bread and it's game over but wait!We came in for oysters! And 'lo and behold', it's Thursday, $1.50 oyster night.  While you're enjoying a dozen of the variety raw half shelled, save room for a few 'Nawlin' style! Baked in magic sauce and loaded with buttery goodness, you might want extra crusty French bread to soak it all up. Sweet satisfaction! We could not eat one more bite but seriously considering the brown sugar 'crack' pie! But really that must be for next time.  We finished up our pump kick and the the super spicy Bloody Mary and a miller light beer back...contemplating the walk to the car...",Maria D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2002/1/17,"We had a 3 star and a 5 star meal here.  I'll be coming back.Oysters are a no brainer.  Ambience is excellent.  Great menu.  Wait staff world class first visit.  Not so good the next time.",Kenny N.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,5/26/16,"The Pearl presented a couple firsts for me: it was my first Cameron Mitchell and it was my first time experiencing oysters. It was NOT the first time I had to pull the ol' ""quickly check your bank account app after seeing the prices"" trick, but it was totally worth it. Appropriately placed near Short North's upscale offerings, The Pearl is an anchor to Columbus' 5 star dining experience.Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirl, let's talk about those oysters. Here's a tip: you may not leave The Pearl until you have consumed their oysters. I can personally vouch for the Oysters on a Half Shell and the N'awlins Style Oysters. Incredibly fresh. Great flavors. Their snacks and starters are also very impressive. The jalapeÌ±o corn spoon bread is a great dish for the table! My favorite dish on the entree offerings has to be the hanger steak. But Phil, it's the Pearl. Why are you eating steak at a seafood place? Great question. It's probably one of the best steaks I've had in Columbus. Incredible. If there was one thing keeping this from a 5, it's probably that the replay value isn't through the roof for me. I've been there 3 times, and by the third time I was suffering from a bit of menu fatigue. It'd be cool to see some new offerings every now and then. Overall, I give it 2 thumbs way up!",Phil C.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,2,11/13/16,"This place was underwhelming at best. The oysters were probably the highlight of the meal. The tater tots were morel like fried mash potato balls than true tater tots, which would've been fine if I hadn't been expecting tater tots. The lamb meatballs were unique but not something I'd get again. The dessert was very thin and not at all decadent as you'd expect dessert to be, which is truly a shame considering I'd been wanting to visit this place for such a long time. Sadly, it was a disappointment.",Valerie P.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2004/5/17,"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in not only the short north but all of Columbus. To start off they have valet parking for $8 right in front of the restaurant which you aren't going to find anything cheaper for the 1-2 hours you'll spend dining. The restaurant itself is classy but not over the top. They bring in the American nice restaurant vibe with adding pieces here and there to make it resemble a seafood restaurant as well. Now to the food. We started off with the Charcuterie Board. While it was good it wasn't my favorite and I'm not sure if I'd get it again especially because it was pretty expensive. Along with this starter we also ordered the Parmesan baked clams. They were cooked in a butter garlic sauce and topped with Parmesan and were awesome. For entrees we got the Artic Char, which was cooked perfectly and came with a roasted cauliflower and purÌ©e, and the Braised short rib, which fell apart and melted in your mouth. Both of these were amazing. I can't speak to every server at the restaurant but the one we had was the most informed waiter I've ever received. He had tried everything on the menu and knew just about anything you could ask about the food. We had told him that it had been a while since my girlfriend and I had been to a nice restaurant and he even brought us a free pie with homemade whipped cream. I don't like whipped cream, but I couldn't get enough of theirs. Overall, it was a great experience. Little on the pricey end but well worth it",Tyler E.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,7/30/17,"Dined on a Friday during happy hour and it can not be beat!!!  Happy hour here is one of the hidden gems in the short north.

The Pearl,578,4,3,2010/8/17,"Last night was my second night at the pearl. I would say the food should be given a 3.5 rating rather than 3 stars. We came late on a Saturday night. We had reservations and the staff properly accommodated us accordingly and we did not have to wait. We were greeted immediately, but after that the service was a little spotty and we waited awhile before we got to put in our actual food order. We started off with the lamb meatballs and jalapeno spoon bread. The lamb meatballs come with three and were flavorful. The spoon bread was honestly the best thing we had all night. It was moist and was accompanied by butter and spicy honey of some sort. It was big enough to share between 3-4 people. For entrees we all shared a cuban sandwich and ricotta dumplings. The dumplings were good, but the portion was small and I felt they were missing something when it came to the flavor. The cuban sandwich was good, a little salty, but a good portion. We swapped out the stew for fries, which were also pretty good. For dessert we tried a chocolate creme pie. It again was good, but nothing absolutely amazing. The location is great and menu isn't bad, but nothing particularly sticks out about The Pearl.",Jamie M.,,,,,,

Parking can be hard so either valet or risk finding a meter. The drink list is great for a Gastropub, try the local North High pearl oyster stout. The jalapeÌ±o spoon cornbread was super yummy, but i did not taste any jalapeÌ±os.  The selection of oysters was great, we got 4 different east coast types, I always let them choose the variety.  The meals were really good, although the serving size was kind of smaller than I expected, which is fine if you get an appetizer. The service over all was absolutely wonderful.",Maureen H.,,,,,,

I love good Cole slaw and this slaw was as good as I've had, finely sliced and creamy.

We saw they had the front wall open and some super comfy armchairs with our names on them, so we sat down and waited for a server.  And waited.  And waited.  The place was not that busy.  Servers walked right by us without even glancing our way.  The hostess was standing right in front of us, looked right at us, and ignored us.  After about 10 minutes, I got up, went to the bar and ordered drinks.  I brought them back to our chairs and we sat and enjoyed ourselves.  At no point did anyone from the staff come and ask us if we needed anything else, wanted another drink, or anything.  Left wondering if the two of us fifty-somethings were just not cool or cute enough to rate anyone's attention?

The Pearl,578,4,5,2008/9/17,"In town for conference so I did some research and this place looked pretty good. Six of us waited an hour on Tuesday night, we had no idea it was so popular. It was worth the wait. Service was excellent. We had the fried chicken, shrimp and grits and the short rIbs. We were very happy with our choices.  We'd all recommend The Pearl.",Kevin J.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,7/23/17,"Came here for Sunday brunch (and thankfully had reservations). The food was good and our waiter was friendly and attentive. The ambiance here is great, especially during the summer when the front windows are open. I highly recommend the Duke of Pearl cocktail. I had the short rib poutine topped with sunny side up eggs along with 3 oysters. The oysters were fresh and a pretty good size. The poutine dish skimped a little on the short rib, but it was well prepared and tasted great. I am looking forward to coming back for dinner to check out additional entrees and the wine list!",Kristine M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,5/22/16,"Very trendy, well-visited place. It was packed on a Saturday night. We waited about 45 minutes to be seated. I loved the way the male waiters were dressed. They each wore white dress shirts with a ties and vests. Sort of a throwback to the days of speakeasies. Anyway, I probably ordered the wrong dish; as it seemed that most of the patrons were thoroughly enjoying their meals.Mine wasn't bad, just not as good as I hoped it would be. I ordered braised short rib, which came with a side of mashed potatoes and root veggies.I also had a glass of merlot, which made up for the points lost on the meal. The waiter Kevin was friendly.The decor was very nice as well. In the bathrooms were large glass bottles of listerine with cups. I'd never seen anything of the such. Listerine? Ummm, ok.Anyway, overall I enjoyed it. The one super cool thing was that our bills were presented to us in books. I noticed that other patrons had written inscriptions inside, although I did not. I will purchase and read the title I received, however. It may be a sign that I need to read it.",Karol C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,2009/8/17,"First few visit to Pearl were fantastic.  In the year the food quality and service have really dropped.  Consistently late seating even with a reservation.

The Pearl,578,4,4,2005/10/16,"Date of Visit: 5/4/2016We were looking for a nice seafood restaurant and came across The Pearl. It was quite crowded so we were hoping the food matched the enthusiasm of the clientele. We began our meal with their stuffed dates (Devils on Horseback) which were very good and went on to order the Shrimp and Grits and the Ricotta Dumplings. Both entrees were perfect size and extremely delicious. We ordered a desert I had their blackberry cobbler and my associate had the Boston Creme pie, both deserts were large enough to share and the waiter should've made the clear when we order because we both left a large portion of it as we stay in hotel and have no way to refrigerate leftovers. We'll be returning to The Pearl after sampling the rest of the restaurants on High Street.",Claude S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2001/11/17,"It was fine. I got the ricotta dumplings and it was yummy. The fried chicken my boyfriend got was a little dry. Not as impressed as we could of been. Cornbread was a little underwhelming as well. In summary: A little over priced and a little over rated.",Katelynn S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2001/11/17,"What a fun date night. Now that my hubster and I are empty nesters we have decided to eat our way through the area. Our goal is to try something new a different every month. In December we decided we needed to try Pearl. I'm so glad we did. It's true that it's pretty loud hit not so loud you can't have a conversation. The decor gives a totally 70s retro vibe, but in a good way. I want to go back for the tater tots and deviled eggs alone. So so so yummm.  My mouth was so happy. The margarita wasn't too sweet and was very strong. Just perfect!! For dinner I ordered the shrimp and grits, liked them a lot but could have used a bit more spice and my sweets ordered the pork chop and it was good as well. Their snacks menu is Definitely where it's at. Can't wait to go back for drinks and snacks!!",Lori H.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,3/20/17,"Early Sunday dinner March 19, 2017, reservation for 9.   We were looking forward to trying this Cameron Mitchell restaurant- (Mr Mitchell certainly would not be pleased with this location had he been in our seats).   Service was terrible, our waiter was rude & then ditched us.    9 peeps- 3 apps, 8 meals, and 2 slices of pie ordered.   All 3 courses took forever to arrive it seemed.  Apps were good, meals were sub par for a Mitchell restaurant,  pie crust was as tough as leather, diet coke was ordered and returned...... wasn't diet,  was flat, and not crisp or cold.   Grits were at best room temp.  Fish and chips were ordered we asked that the fries be well done.   Fries, tarter, and cocktail sauce arrived - but no fish or slaw.   20 minutes into everyone's meal we asked about the fish - was told it was never cooked.   We cancelled that order. I get it-  we aren't hip -   we weren't drinking -  but if you don't want host  a family of non drinkers on a Sunday afternoon -  please post it on your site or at the front door.     It was embarrassing as we were hosting guests from Florida.....  they did comp the pie and apps - as they knew the ball was dropped, however,  we won't ever recommend or go back.",Jackie L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,10/26/16,"Top notch food and service. From the time I got there, the service was excellent. The hostess was courteous and took care of me right away. My party was not there right away so I took a seat at the bar. The Bartender was professional and attentive and they had a great appetizer and beer menu. We were seated close to my reservation time and the food and service continued to be great! Started with the oysters which were amazing! Followed by the Hangar steak which was cooked perfectly and had a  wonderful flavor. Waiter was attentive and knowledgeable and really took care of us. TOP NOTCH establishment. I would go back again!!!",Matthew H.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2/28/16,"Short North Brunch All Star  Wanted brunch and The Pearl's menu looked interesting so packed in the family and went there.  The wait wasn't as long as expected, only 25 minutes.  Parent note:  had my infant son with me and he needed his diaper changed.  They have NO CHANGING STATIONS AT ALL, but all the bathrooms have a table with mouthwash  and cups.  I cleared off the table and used it to change him.  Also there is no place to leave a stroller and while they have booster seats and high chairs, it is really tight in there so the high chair is being squeezed by by patrons and staff the entire meal.  Also it is loud in there.  On to the food; tried the Tavern Benny, N'awlins Oysters, chicken and waffles, and huevos rancheros entrees.  The chicken and waffles was the least appealing because the waffles were dry.  The chicken had lots of flavor though and was quite enjoyable.  The huevos rancheros would be second lowest even though it was great.  Had a southwest feel to the flavors, they provide the dish with soft shells to be loaded up like tacos.  Excellent!  Second best was the tavern benny.  This was like biscuits with gravy and an absolute flavor bomb.  The best dish, however, was the N'awlins oysters.  The flavors for these 3 little oysters were incredible.  It was garlicy, cheesy, oyster goodness.  Only wish is that there was more for the course.  This brunch is a must-try, make a reservation if possible to avoid the wait.",Will P.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,7/14/17,"The Pearl is amazing!  The food is outstanding (the oysters are so fresh!) and the cocktails are tasty.  I have dined here so many times and had just a few not-so-great experiences, but even when something gets screwed up, the staff goes over and above to fix the problem!  The thing that has absolutely sold me on this restaurant is an experience I had here a couple of years ago.  My daughter has several food allergies, so what she can order from any menu is limited.  She had loved an item that was on the children's menu, but we came in this particular time, the item was no longer on the menu.  The server offered to run over to Marcella's (a sister restaurant nearby) to get something similar that she would like.  Although the other restaurant was not so far away, the offer floored me.  We did not take the server up on his kind offer, but it really left an impression.  The service here is always that fantastic and can really make the difference in a memorable meal.",Kaiser C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2010/12/17,"One of my favorite places in short north. Nice ambiance. Well decorated. Good drink list.. usually I'll get wine here.

Sometimes we like to end our nights out here and share a bottle of wine and order slices of pie. Highly recommend!",Anne R.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,9/13/16,Service and restaurant are great but does not over power the food. I wish when I ordered dozen oysters I was given option to order 12 of the same oyster vs 4 different kinds which 3/4 were very horrible. Fried chicken wings and clam chowder overly salty. I was warned but I feel the need to try myself. I'm glad I tried it out but I will never go back. Only positive food option was the jalapeÌ±o cornbread and the peel & eat shrimp. But not worth price or bad food experience.,Bay N.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,3/18/15,"I would consider this place cozier than classy, which for me is winning. It's good food without the stuffiness and very personable servers (shout out to Eric).I think I had the best seat in the house.. facing the window for the best people watching ever! But aside for that, let's talk about FOOD. I had the following:Tuna Crudo - This was delightful.. I'd ask for NO SALT as it made this way to salty. It's nice thin cuts of tuna and every other bite a piece of rock salt.. too much, but it didn't stop me from eating it. I just moved the salt around.House Pickles - These were nice starters. Nice variety and nice flavors.""Special"" Roasted Chicken -- I had them replace the quinoa salad (which I hear is mahvelous with charred broccoli and root vegetables.  This was good, flavorful, and moist!Of everything I have a new love for charred veggies. I think this might have been my favorite. Sounds good, but it was so delicious followed by the Tuna and the chicken. One thing to note is that food is not a factory here, so don't be in a super hurry. From sit down to check for 1 person, it took about an hour and they didn't seem that busy.",Mironda R.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,3,2004/4/16,"I tried the JalapeÌ±o Corn Spoon Bread. It was served on a wooden board with a pad of butter with honey in the center of it. The bread was flavorful and of good texture and consistency. The honey was a great compliment to the flavors. For my main I got the Hanger steak. The menu said it was pineapple marinated, but I didn't notice the flavor. The steak was on top of Kimchee Fried Rice and a fried egg was placed off to the side. The heat from the Kimchee Fried Rice was the noticeable ingredient in the dish and while it caught me off guard it was not overwhelming. I mostly ate the steak by itself, and then broke my fried egg with the remaining fried rice which made for a nice side. Overall the food was okay. I felt the flavors and textures in my dish could have melded better together. My friend's fish (with the fish and chips dish) was a bit fishy and my other friend's shrimp (with the peel and eat shrimp dish) could have been cleaned more pristinely. The waiter we had was friendly and on top of things. The decor in the restaurant is simply beautiful, warm and inviting. I would welcome spending more time in such a comfortably decorated space.",Ben S.,,,,,,

The first time we were on a Food Adventure  (which by the way is HIGHLY recommended as well) and we were treated like royalty with huge samples of amazing food and great drinks and service. We've even gone there on two special occasions, our anniversary and when we announced our engagement to our families, and again we were treated so special. I actually wish I could give them 10 stars out of 5... it's that great for real. Go there and enjoy!",Tom C.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,4,11/14/16,"Solid 4...maybe a 4 1/2.  I had the calm chowder for starters.  Now, I've had clamp chowder from Nova Scotia to San Francisco and this was the 1st time I've ever had whole class in the bowl.  It added an extra little something to it.  Really good stuff.Then I had their house pickles.  A little sweet, a little dill and a little spicy and very addicting. For my main course, I had the strip steak, grilled broccoli and loaded potato.  In a word, FANTASTIC!  Cooked perfectly and served on a cutting board.  Really tasty.  If you're in the Arena District, it's worth the short walk.",Mark E.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,3/31/17,"I have been here a few times, and I really enjoy most everything I have ate and drank. The devilled eggs are quite good, with a tad bit of a bite.

The Pearl,578,4,5,6/30/17,"I loved my meal at the Pearl.  Had brunch with a friend.  We split a cinnamon bun and I had the grits.  I could tell it was all quality.  And the checks in old books, love!",SpartyGal M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,2009/10/17,"Oh my goodness......where to begin. We had a brunch reservation and waited 15 min for our table (no problem, busy day). Finally, we were seated and ordered a round of drinks. We waited 20 min for our drinks. I ordered eggs over medium (they ended up sunny-side) and sausage, they ran out of sausage so I got bacon. My fellow diners both ordered the omelette special of the day; which included mushrooms, bacon, and gruyÌ¬re cheese. I will include pictures of the omelettes, as they were neat inedible. The mushrooms were not even cooked, and they tasted like cork-- inedible. It was also cold and the eggs tasted pre-made with bacon, and zero cheese. I am a supporter of Cameron Mitchell's restaurants and local Columbus businesses alike; and I am very disappointed. Also, the counter next to my table was dirty and not bused the entire 2 hours we spent here. We told our server about the inedible mushrooms, and she apologized and took it off the bill. Left the restaurant hungry, with no word of apology from at least the manager and I will not return. JalapeÌ±o cornbread is the bomb though",Leah C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,9/20/17,We had a mahi mahi with salsa and sauce. Tasted very bland. The fish was overdone and was also overpriced.,Kastur D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2008/6/16,"The oysters were pretty great. We got raw, fried and baked. Fried came with collared greens, they just tasted like fried food. Baked was nice, there is a spicy kick to them. The best is raw, to my surprise, they make sure there aren't too many shards of shell, and the presentation is nice. Fried chicken was quite delicious. It comes with four large pieces of fried chicken, perfectly seasoned and moist, and a cinnamon bun which was like dessert and dinner at the same time. Loved it!  Great service to boot!",Anita C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,12/30/15,"It was fine.  Yup that's all I got.  I've never been a huge fan of any of the Mitchell's restaurants.  They aren't bad.

It could be made by anyone and it needs heart.If one more person says Cap City is their favorite diner I will freak the f*** out.",Michael U.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2003/5/17,"De-flippin-lightful! Had 9:15 reservations here last night, and it was most certainly a good choice. As we arrived a little early, we sat at the bar. The bartenders were fantastic! Super knowledgeable and very personable. I really enjoyed my punch...cant remember the name. It had apples and rum and tasted like unicorn glitter and autumn. My partner's manhattan was also very good. We were seated at 9:15 on the dot, and our server was just and friendly as the bartenders. He took time explaining the menu and was upbeat and helpful. We ordered cold oysters, and they along with the house cocktail sauce and the horseradish sauce were amazing! I ordered the fish and chips, which were fantastic. The fish was moist and crispy and not at all soggy or greasy. And the chips were hand cut and yummy. My partner's steak was good, but came out medium-well. When our server came back around to check on us, he saw the steak and recognized that with was overdone without anyone having to say anything. He brought out a new steak and a free dessert. Score!! I will definitely be back! Never thought seafood and comfort food could work, but it definitely does...here at least.",Emma O.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,9/19/16,"Really cute place ... Great vibe inside and the decor is very cool. Gives you a real feeling of being in a vintage seafood restaurant. You can also view the semi-open kitchen and raw bar. Drinks are awesome, try the Moscow mule which they're famous for or the duke of pearl (comes with a tiny plastic soldier) but watch out for the pepper flakes! The stuffed clams are a must for an appetizer. The crispy melted cheese is to die for and soaking up the juice with a crispy baguette is the cherry on top. Entrees....the hangar steak is delicious and is served with a perfectly done kimchi fried rice, not too spicy but the right amount of kick. The short ribs are also a great choice, completely melty and the port reduction is perfect for the mash. Unique touch at the end of dinner having the check arrive in an old book, with pages full of patrons signatures and notes.",Kristina S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,1/23/17,"LOVE the food, Love the HH, and Love bartender Brenden! I arrived at the bar around 4:50 and had no idea the happy hour was so amazing! HH runs from 4-6 and includes all drinks, starters, sandwiches, and oysters. They have a really good wine list and the cocktail list is pretty expansive. Brenden patiently answered all of my questions, was very attentive, and made some great suggestions. For starters I had the smoked salmon and it was really good and kind of interesting being served with the deviled egg. The main course consisted of ricotta dumpling and jalapeÌ±o spoon bread. Both were incredibly delicious except I think they could add a bit more kale to the dumplings; the honey and whipped butter was an excellent addition to the spoon bread. I love me some grilled cheese and decided to get it to go. Of course I couldn't leave without getting dessert and dug in to the brown sugar pie which is just as divine as everyone says. I can't wait to come back to try some of their other delicious options.",Quin T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,1/27/17,"I went back for burger and beer week and fell in love all over again. Excellent service (this is a CM restaurant, after all) and great prices for the specials. I tried oysters for the first time and WOW--even if you like them raw, you have to try the baked oysters; cheesy, spicy, and absolutely delicious. According to their Instagram, they have happy hour prices on oysters all evening on Thursday, so I'll definitely be back for that!",Taby A.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,2006/9/17,"I had never been to The Pearl, but after eating dinner there with my boyfriend, I definitely want to go back!  We started with the Jalapeno Corn Spoon Bread, which I would have never ordered if I had been on my own, as I am not a corn bread fan or really into jalapenos.  It was delicious, which caught me completely by surprise.  The jalapenos contrasted with the sweeter taste of the corn bread.  Very easy to share with a couple of people, too - it was a little big for just two to split.  We also tried the Lamb Meatballs snack, which was much smaller as it is just a few meatballs with a sauce and garnish.  These were yummy.  For dinner, I had the braised short rib.  It was very tender; it kept falling apart without any help from a knife.  It comes with mashed potatoes and a few root vegetables, which balance out the rich sauce that the short ribs are covered with.  Very good.  We finished with a slice of their signature fresh pie, which was delicious.  Throughout our meal, the service was impeccable, and we never felt rushed or neglected.  I also liked the dim-lit, cozy vibe of the restaurant.  What initially kept me away from The Pearl was the way traditional menu items are infused with some sort of oddity (like the jalapenos in the corn bread) that made me think I wouldn't enjoy may dishes on the menu.  I couldn't have been more wrong!  Don't get caught up in the details of each dish, just trust that The Pearl knows what they're doing.",Hannah B.,,,,,,

The octopus appetizer was unique and tasty. Highly recommended. I had the grilled cheese sandwich and the grilled Brie with the pear jam was an awesome combo.  Others liked the Cuban sandwich, fried chicken and fish and chips. Service was outstanding. Good wine and beer selection and they have a variety of pies for dessert.  I highly recommend this place.",Mark S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,9/19/17,"Took the wife to The Pearl for her birthday with the whole family.  First, our waiter was beyond excellent.  Second, the food was very good.

I ordered the Pub Burger and it was very good, and very large--couldn't finish it, but took it home and it was almost as good (with my limited ability to reheat) as it was at the restaurant.  Great atmosphere and a fun experience.  That was our first time, but we will definitely go back.",Shawn O.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2/14/16,"I recently brought my boyfriend here for a birthday brunch with friends. I made a reservation through Open Table for 12:30pm. When we weren't seated until 12:53, I was not a happy customer. What's the point of making a reservation?? The girls at the hostess stand weren't very polite either. My group was just about to go somewhere else when they come over to seat us and from there, things were great! The restaurant is beautiful inside. I love the way the way the servers dressed and gave the restaurant a really classy feel. It gets pretty crowded but they manage the space well.We brought a cake with us for the birthday boy and our server offered to put it in the cooler for us. She was very attentive and friendly. I ordered the huevos rancheros and they were a little bland because I had to get them without the sauce in order to be dairy free but they were still good. My boo got the French toast and he loved it. My other friends got the burgers and they looked really good, too.What really put our visit over the top was when our server brought out The cake with lit candles on it! It was perfect. We had such a great experience and it was mostly because of her excellent service. We will be back and hopefully our experience with the hostess stand will bring them into the 5 star range next time!",Erica R.,,,,,,

Shrimp & grits among the best I've ever had, the short ribs and horseradish potatoes not to be missed. Also: enjoy must-have jalapeno cornbread and believe that the Devils on Horseback are one-of-a-kind (and you get FIVE of them, so how does THAT work??), beer offering good, cocktails better, with the Bulleit Punch hitting the spot.This place will outlast the pretenders on High Street... it's got the real Southern savoir faire.",Chris D.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,4,2011/8/16,"My mom absolutely loves seafood, so with her coming in for the weekend it seemed like the perfect time to try out The Pearl. And are we glad we did! We were seated right away on a busy Friday night with our reservation. Even though I booked a week beforehand, we were unfortunately placed at a high top table right by the door. I would recommend you request a table toward the back to avoid the hustle and bustle around your meal, as it took away from the awesome ambiance. The restaurant itself isn't the largest, but it has a sultry downtown feel with oceanic decor. My mom and I split the spinach salad, topped with goat cheese, almonds, and a bacon vinaigrette. The ingredients were delicious and fresh, but was overloaded with dressing. For the main course, I ordered the Hanger Steak. They were out of the strip steak used for this dish, so our awesome waitress offered to sub it with the Angus steak instead at no extra cost. Hands down the best steak dish I've had, pineapple marinated and topped with fried egg. Mom got the pub burger, and loved it! She said the cheese was the perfect touch. Overall, great food and service. We will be back!",Raquel B.,,,,,,

I had a peach bellini and it was solid, lots of champagne. For the meal, I had had of the Tavern Benny and half of the pancakes. The Tavern Benny was awesome, very flavorful and moist. The pancakes, however, were very dense and had too much lemon for my preference. I would order the Tavern Benny again, but definitely not those pancakes.",Kelly C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,6/18/16,Great experience all around. We came in tired and hot from a day at the Zoo. We were seated right away and greeted promptly by our server - who was great. We shared peel and eat shrimp. They're gulf shrimp and flown in daily! We also shared the charcuterie  which was mostly good. The chicken liver was out of this world good but the rest was just ok. We then shared the dumplings. They were light and fluffy and flavorful. I thought then wine by the glass list was limited but the cocktail selection was great. They serve their bloody mary's with a miller high life back which was awesome! Great spot!,Jenna C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,3/13/17,"Cannot go wrong here. Everything on the menu including drinks is well thought out and absolutely delicious. Food done right. I have never had anything to complain about at this restaurant. Some of my go tos are the Moscow mule, oysters on the half shell, the beet salad, pub burger, and fried chicken. I've sampled many other things on the menu as well that are just fantastic. Not to forget the service. Always knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. Continues to be my favorite restaurant.",Danielle Y.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,10/30/16,"I really enjoyed our dining experience at the pearl. We ate on a Saturday night and there was a wait if you didn't have a reservation, you can make one online. We started with the jalapeÌ±o cornbread and honey butter for a starter. It came in a cast iron baking dish and was so yummy, not too spicy and just a little sweet. I ordered the fried chicken and my colleague ordered the shrimp & grits. The fried chicken was really good and I love how this dish was served with a sticky bun! I didn't even need to order dessert. I had a bite of my colleague's shrimp and grits and it was really tasty as well. The portions are large and perfect for sharing. Next time I will be back for the cocktails!",Lea G.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,4/29/17,"This is one of my favorites in Columbus. Been there twice and have never disappointed. It's definitely on the expensive side but completely worth it.

The food seemed to take a while to come out, but was tasty when it finally did come out. The fish and chips was really big and is big enough to share. For dessert we got the brown sugar pie, which is like pecan pie without the pecans. It was good, but not as great as I was anticipating. Overall nice night, but I prefer a lot of the other Cameron Mitchell restaurants.",Madison D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,12/23/15,"Devils on Horseback are phenomenal. Chicken Wing starters with hot sauce are also not greasy and delicious. JalapeÌ±o corn spoon bread melts in your mouth. Entree was the grilled cheese. An explosion of delicious cheese and pear jam takes the cake. Also tried the Ricotta Dumplings and the Pub Burger. Absolutely amazing flavors. The oysters are also shucked to perfection! You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Bet the Snickers pie is just as good. You're gonna have to wheel me out of here.",Danielle J.,,,,,,

I would have rather had White Castle sliders!The service was great, hostess was very nice!All jokes aside, worst Cuban sandwich I have ever had!

It was a weird combination. I would have preferred strawberries.,Jennifer S.,,,,,,

Yes, we did have to wait even past our reservation time, but that was no problem with the outstanding service!  Our server Gaby is the best!  She did not hesitate and was on top of everything.  The drinks were wonderful.  The food was even better!  First of all Gaby brought us some apps of spoon bread and deviled eggs.  We were not expecting these but wow! Both were very good.  We then had the smoked salmon and assorted oysters.  The baked oysters were exceptionally good!Also, we happened upon some confit pork that was being served to our next door neighbor table and that was just incredible!  Along with this we also got to chat with Natalie, the executive chef, as well as Ian (regional chef?) who were both really friends and so passionate about the restaurant. I can not recommend this enough.

The Pearl,578,4,3,2004/7/17,"Reservations recommended on Weekends. Food menu looks good and makes you want to have more than one item. I tried cornbread with jalapeno which came sort of lacking a lot of JalapeÌ±o and was too sweet for my expectations. Shrimp and frits..as expected! Balanced taste of the herbs on kielbasa with the sauce and shrimps. Beers were average, especially the ones on tap for the night were not impressive. Heavy seas beer on tap was too much citrus... almost like having a bottle of perfume. Ommegang reminded me of juice albeit was very strong for a beer. Overall, I rated this place a 3 stars for freshness of food, great services. Took 2 stars for the cramped space, noise and lack of parking nearby.",Pawan P.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2003/8/17,Amazing atmosphere. The food is done very well. The service is also great.  I had the Korean style steak and it was tasty. The pork chop is very tender and  juicy. I forgot what appetizers I got but they were all very delicious.,Laura C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,5/25/16,"This is the only place I go back to whenever I visit Columbus and it's always been a good experience. Last night's visit was one of the best. Raw oysters, baked oysters, fried oysters all fresh and delicious all the time. Lots of good drinks and appetizers are half off for happy hour. Beet salad, clam chowder soup, deviled eggs, tuna crudo, brown sugar pie: some of the best. Nothing tops their corn bread with honey and spread. It's a must have. We wanted to try the short ribs but had no room left for that. Next time. Don't miss the bloody marrys and the margaritas at the Pearl. Tasty! Service was interesting. Didn't try too hard but did a good job. My boyfriend's birthday dinner was perfect. He loved the food and the server's attitude. Not too overwhelming but there when needed. Thanks Eric.",Lena P.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,7/21/16,"What a phenomenal restaurant! Visiting Columbus on business and the agency took me here for dinner, racing that it was one of the best. Located in the hip North Shore neighborhood, this restaurant is a classy joint, a fusion of seafood and nice casual steak house. Atmosphere it's classy yet comfortable. Service is great! We started with the Tater Tots, Deviled Eggs, and Bacon Wrapped Dates; all fantastic! The deviled eggs were surprisingly gourmet, the tater tots like none other I've had, and the bacon wrapped goat cheese stuffed dates out of this world with perfectly balanced flavors! I had the special for my entree: Wild Sockeye Salmon with a Wine Butter Sauce, Roasted Tomatoes, and Marscapone Polenta. INCREDIBLE! So decadent, very gourmet. This was honestly one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had! I am also told the Shrimp and Grits and the Cuban Sandwich are tasty favorites. This was a wonderful and filling dining experience!",Johnny N.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,9/28/16,"We ended up going for a late brunch, and things started out great, but then they went a little downhill. The server was great at checking the dishes for a nut allergy, and she seemed attentive, but then one guest didn't receive her drink, for the entrees guests didn't get their orders of tater tots (they were kind of worth the wait, but still...), and then the second round of drinks was pretty terrible. I ordered the Duke of Pearl cocktail first, and it was amazing! So good that others at the table decided to switch their orders for the second round from other cocktails to the Duke of Pearl, and this second round was in no way like the first. Members of the party took sips of my drink, so they had an accurate comparison. The food was decent, but I doubt I'd make a huge effort to return. On the plus side, I'd never been to a restaurant that was so considerate as to provide mouthwash and little cups in the bathroom. Interesting and thoughtful touch!",Emily T.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,7/24/15,"Two words: Cinnamon bun!The greatest cinnamon bun I've ever had in my life! Maybe one of the best taste sensations I've had. Period. Maybe that's an exaggeration, I don't know, but it was pretty damn good.Anyway, I always wanted to check out The Pearl, but it was impossible to get in when it first opened, so I just forgot about. The girlfriend and I didn't have any plans on a Sunday night, so we thought we'd check it out. The restaurant appears big, but the kitchen takes up most of the left half, and most of the dining area is in the back. Our server was really friendly and helpful and really funny. I could have him review each dish for me all day.We started with lamb meatballs and the smoked salmon. The lamb meatballs were amazing, definitely my favorite of the two. I'm not usually a smoked salmon person, but I had no problem eating most of this dish. However, the lamb meatballs were the bigger win for me.For the main course, I went with the fried chicken, which of course came with the best thing ever, the cinnamon bun! I don't even know if they paired well together, because the thing was so good. Put it with spaghetti for all I care. All right, so the fried chicken was fantastic as well. There's so much good fried chicken in this city already, no wonder we're overweight. Oh well, it was super crunchy with tasty seasoning and the chicken was moist and delicious. It also came with some braised greens, but those were pretty forgettable. By the time I was done with this dish, you could wheel me out.Unfortunately, me feeling like shit isn't when I stop eating, especially when I haven't been to a restaurant before, and all of their desserts are pies and sound amazing. No idea what a brown sugar pie was, but we got it, and it was wonderful. Basically they just take a bunch of brown sugar and pack it together in I'm guessing a bunch of other unhealthy oils and butter then shoot homemade whip cream all over it. Fantastic. My new favorite dessert!If you haven't been to The Pearl, I would highly recommend checking it out. It's a little less pricey than other Cameron Mitchell restaurants, but it's serving the same high quality food. They have a brunch that's supposed to be wonderful as well, and you can get the cinnamon rolls on the side. I'll be the one ordering 15 to go.",Gus W.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2005/7/16,"Well, here it is. This is a review I had been putting off for awhile as I had been avoiding this place. They hype around it rather put me off as happens with many places that are hyped up. I hear people tell me how fantastic everything is. That's great, I am glad to hear but it puts me off as I will go and it will never live up.  Okay, enough of all that. So their brunch was good, the combos they offered all sounded fantastic. I went with poached eggs with sausage, biscuits, and gravy. It was damn good if I am to be honest. I had some oysters too which, again tasty. The bloody mary did live up to the hype so I was excited about that. Probably one of the best bloody marys in town honestly.  Now it begs the question, Is all of that worth the price? I feel it was not. As good as the bloody mary is it was not worth 10$. I had a very excellent bloody mary the weekend before at Ethel and Tank for 5$. E&T also has a bloody mary bar that goes along with it with more selections of vodka. So the bloody mary, good but not ten dollars good. The meal was around 14$ which was fair I feel. The oysters 9$ for 3..... eh not worth it. They put them selfs out as an oyster bar but I have been to posters bars and I got way more oysters for 9$. So that was a little disappointing.  I will go back for sure, try dinner or lunch out. Their fish and chips looked amazing and that is one of my favs. I also saw they had bangers and mash so I want to go back and try that as well. It will though, for the price, not be my new place for bloody marys sadly.",Ryan D.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,2006/6/16,"The Pearl is a perfect mix of upscale and casual. This is my go-to crowd pleaser restaurant, and that strategy has never failed me - not even when my less-adventurous friend ordered a well-done burger. The menu reads like a partial list of Southern picnic items, but the food itself is top-notch comfort. After several visits, I love it all, but my particular favorites include the devils on horseback -- bacon-wrapped dates -- and the molasses pie.The atmosphere is ""modern rustic,"" complete with reclaimed wood, mason jar glasses, and Edison bulbs. They keep the place dimly lit and their servers in plaid, so it all feels like you're dining at an unscale country inn. Service here can be a little slow when it gets busy, but is great overall.",Lauren H.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,1,2/13/17,"For a Cameron Mitchell restaurant in the Short North, The Pearl was a huge disappointment. If you're interested in the experience you could potentially have, keep reading.It was a date night for my girlfriend and I, we had been eyeing The Pearl for months now and were excited to make a special night of it. We had made a reservation in advance and were placed in a terrible table in the corner of the restaurant. Our server at the time had 3 tables, us included. During which we were left unattended for an extended period of time, with drinks and plates empty. Meanwhile the table next to us with a different server was well taken care of. Our server was sometimes on the floor, but never attending to us. We felt she was very disconnected...2 drinks later, one in which we had to ask the assuming manager for...we over heard another table in her section mention our server had forgot their order of oysters, which is especially concerning since this business carries a slogan as an ""oyster bar."" Food was warm never hot, drinks were especially good thank goodness for that.

The place was crowded on a Saturday night.  The decor was quirky, yet inviting.  The crowd was eclectic, leaning towards hipster.The food was universally delicious.  Each person in our party was very pleased with their selection.  Two of us ordered the fish and chips.  The fish was crispy, tender and not greasy.  The chips were hot and crisp.The southern fried chicken was a pleasant surprise.  I must admit I was a little skeptical of fried chicken this far north.  My mistake.  The chicken was perfectly fried and light.  The cinnamon roll served as a side was a unique twist and provided a great contrast of sweet and savory.The shrimp and grits were another pleasant surprise.  The shrimp were large and properly cooked, not over or under done.  The sausage and poblano pepper added a nice fiery flavor that complimented the dish without overwhelming the other favors.Finally, the cocktail and beer menu was extensive.  I chose the Pearl oyster stout.  It was a real treat.  Crisp and dry, perhaps the best stout I've ever had.",Ron W.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,4,4/23/15,"The Pearl is one of my favorite seafood restaurants in town, and probably my favorite place to visit if I'm in the mood for shrimp.I've never actually made it to the entree or dessert section of the menu, but I can tell you that the appetizers and seafood is fantastic. The Tavern Fries are warm and thick cut, crispy on the outside and soft inside. I dare you to just eat one. The House Smoked Salmon is also quite good, but nothing to write home about.If you only get one thing, get the Peel & Eat Gulf Shrimp. Just do it. Trust me. They're colossal; full of flavor without tasting too much like the ocean. Divine. Also of note is the Dressed Colossal Blue Crab. At $19 for a small portion, it is on the pricey side, but it is absolutely worth every single bite.The only downside is the wait. I've had a reservation every time I've dined there, and yet I wait an average of 20-30 minute past my reservation time before I am seated. Yes, sometimes I've had stare-downs with the hostesses in an effort to convey my displeasure. No, I'm not proud of it. No, I don't think I was seated any more quickly as a result.",Dee M.,,,,,,

The outside was crunchy but the inside was so moist. I got the daily omelette, which was yummy and the perfect amount of food for me. My sister got the grilled cheese and she said it was delicious, but who doesn't love brie and jam?

The flavoring and grease level was off putting and I didn't even eat the leftovers. The side dishes were disjointed; the greens were disgusting and the sweet roll belonged at Cinnabon or dessert.

If you expect quality to be commensurate with price, this isn't the place.  The food is good.  That's it.  Just good.  You could probably make most dishes better yourself.  The Oysters are awful compared to many other locations.  Avoid.  They're simply bad.  Most dishes have little to no imagination.  The service is average.  If you're a novice at dining out, it's worth checking out once or twice.  Otherwise this is a terribly average and boring place.",Doug A.,,,,,,

Decided to waited at the bar or as close as we could get to it.  Ordered a drink from a somewhat snobby bartender, who, granted was busy, but acted like I inconvenienced him when ordering two mixed drinks. The food, excellent, price point, fair and the table service was spectacular.  Unfortunate beginning to our evening however it turned out alright.  I will return!",George W.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,3/27/16,"Delicious brunch menu when we went about 2 weeks ago, we had chicken and waffles, the Canadian delight poutine and egg rancheros, all of which was delicious.  Great service and willing to accommodate custom orders as long as it wasn't too off the menu.  The decorations and environment was pleasing and nicely done with lots of lit candles.  We are from the south so we have had better chicken and waffles but it was great for up north.  The deviled eggs our neighbor table looks like they were worth a try.",Anne F.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,4,1/31/15,"I was out with colleagues who raved about the Pearl, and so, off we went.  The space itself is pleasant, it reminds me of what a lot of restaurants (especially cool restaurants in big Midwestern cities) look and feel like - see Taste in St. Louis.  The waitstaff wears hipster chic, the check is delivered in a novel (which is filled with doodles), and the waitstaff explains everything on the menu with great gusto, offering diners oodles of information on their own preferences.  The best of what I sampled at the Peal was the ricotta dumplings - the pop of cheese pairs nicely with the squash, kale, and mushrooms.  The grilled cheese was also, much to my surprise, uttelry delightful - melted brie, pear jam, pesto, and roasted squash (it comes with a small salad).  The shrimp and grits was, in my mind, a bit bland for what the dish promised (it comes with a short rib kielbasa, and lots of gouda cheese).",Jennifer N.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,3/31/15,"Probably my current favorite Cameron Mitchell (in addition to Hudson 29 and the perennial star, Cap City).  I love everything I've tried, including the deviled eggs, salad with beets, meatballs, fried fish, shrimp and grits, etc.  However, I keep coming back to the stellar grilled cheese.  It is so good.  That pear compote is killer.  And the arugula dressed in vinaigrette nicely balances out the cheese.  If you haven't had it, you need to make a special trip to try it asap!!!!",Anna S.,,,,,,

No apologies from the hostess staff, and no drinks or apps offered, even when we requested service. Rather poor treatment. Food was good enough, but when the experience starts off on a bad note it's tough to enjoy the night. From reviews on other sites, this appears to be a common problem. Diners beware.",Jesse S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2001/5/16,"The Pearl never disappoints, unless they're too busy and you have to settle for somewhere else! It just dawned on me that I am yet to leave a review. We stopped in last night near close just for a drink. A waiter assured us that despite the hour we had time for a drink (this is not typical for any restaurant on a Monday night near closing, especially after a long holiday weekend). The bartender also didn't mind, in fact he recommended a drink that took mixing and shaking, not just a simple pour. This stood out to me, I know making complicated drinks can be time consuming and resource intensive, especially if you're trying to prep for the next day, but he made a recommendation and described it so well I couldn't say no. The drink itself was great (bourbon flip?!) Something with apricots. I'd recommend any drink here, even if its not your standard, they have such a neat array of garnishes and ingredients. Anyways, we appreciated the service and expertise of the bar tender. The Pearl never disappoints!",Jordan N.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,3,2002/6/17,Stayed across the street at le meridian.  Decided to try this ace out as we had previously heard great reviews. We got the jalapeÌ±o spoon bread to start. It was ok. Nothing special. I had the Cuban and my wife had the grilled cheese. While hers was excellent mine was average at best. Atmosphere is good.

The Pearl,578,4,5,9/20/16,"Loved this place!My husband and I made an easy online reservation for our wedding anniversary on a Friday night.  We were so excited to go especially after my husband's aunt and uncle told us of how great of an experience they had when they went there.When we arrived we were given two glasses of champagne, on the house, since it was our anniversary.  We got there just in time for happy hour so all of our drinks and appetizers were half off!!  I had the moscow mule which I loved and the Jalapeno Corn bread with a honey butter for an appetizer was just absolutely delicious.  My husband and I tried oysters for the first time and we had them three ways: rare, baked and fried.  I think fried was my favorite but all was good.  After the oysters and corn bread we were a little full so we order one flank steak to share.  The staff was nice enough to split the meal in half and serve it to us in two separate bowls!  The flank steak came with kimche and it was just divine!  We skipped on desert because we were more than satisfied. I can't remember our waitress name but she was excellent as well.I would say this is definitely a great place for a casual romantic lunch or dinner.  It does have a bar and the day we went the entire restaurant was packed.  The noise wasn't too loud but this probably wouldn't be a good place if you really want a really quiet and private romantic dinner.  Other than that the ambiance of this place with its dim lighting and table candles were great.  I would definitely come back to this place when I am in Columbus next time.  Thank you The Pearl for showing us such a great time for our anniversary!",Kia W.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2010/11/16,"One of my favorite restaurants in Columbus. The food is always delicious, the drinks are made well, and the crack pie is to die for! Awesome rustic feel inside too. Highly recommend this place for appetizers and happy hour or date night.",Haley G.,,,,,,

I was not a fan of the martini special so poured it in my friends drink (the server saw me do it and gave me a new Saphire Martini on the house). My friend then joked he wanted chicken pot pie (not on the menu) and ordered something else. The chef showed up with chicken pot pie! Again the server was amazing, really liked the setting, and enjoyed the food.",Jerry K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,2009/12/16,"Less than impressed after reading the reviews!? Reserved brunch and on arrival was told to wait while they prepped our table although numerous tables were available. Then they proceeded to seat 4-5 parties ahead of us. Finally seated us at the worst table in the middle of the room versus a booth or along the wall. Pickles were a small dish, not a pot , dates and bacon were gross and greasy and hard, crudo was a mish mash, drinks were slow but house cured salmon and granola were very good. No hurry to go back, Marcellas is a lot better.",Paul S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2012/9/15,"I came here the morning before my wedding for a pre-marriage lunch with my Groomsmen and had an awesome experience!  The best advice I can give is if you're coming for brunch on the weekend is to ensure that you call ahead - this place gets PACKED.  Which would me my one negative - even though we had a reservation, we still waited about 15minutes, but oh well, no biggie.The joint has a very unique and urban decor which sets up for a great atmosphere if you're here celebrating as I was.  Each of the staff was also very friendly, nice, and helpful - even guiding me to the bathroom! haha.  We each got mimosas, appropriately, which were fantastic and a little strong - just how I like it.  And, oh man, was the food delish! We each got different brunch plates and everyone was raving.  My favorite had to be my brother's breakfast poutine because, well, poutine for breakfast! Always a good decision.  I had the pancakes and bacon which I also loved.  I would highly recommend this plate as the pancakes had a hint of lemon, which really added a unique and different flavor to the pancakes, elevating them above the normal.Overall, we had an awesome experience that really set such a fun mood before my wedding - The Pear is a fantastic spot to hit and celebrate any wonderful occasion with good friends and good food.  Also, Gordon Ramsay just posted a photo of the burgers here at the Pearl on his Facebook and raved about it - just sayin'!",Joe K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,10/25/15,"I came here last Sunday after the Columbus marathon with my VP, her husband and her family a total of 8 of us. I arrived early and got seated at our table and ordered a spicy bloody mary which the server stated was voted the best bloody in Columbus. It was served with a little bottle of Miller like a lot of restaurants serve it in Madison, WI. It was a good bloody. The table ordered the charcuterie board to split and someone ordered the chowder as well. The winner of the board was the chicken liver pate, it was silky and best served on the grilled bread with some house made pickles.I ordered the poutine and while it was good with some good flavor although it needed some salt and pepper as the fries did not have any salt on them. Shredded shortribs were good, two over easy eggs good, I should have asked for them poached that really would have been great. The short rib sauce was a bit runny and lacked depth of flavor. The table then ordered a slice of each pie, the slices were keylime, dutch apple, billionaire brownie and the brown sugar pie aka David Chang's Crack Pie.   My favorite out of the selections was the key lime as it was tart, and the grahm cracker crust was buttery and delicous, however it had a lot of whipped cream as a garnish. Price for me was $31 before tip.",Bill E.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,6/30/16,"Decided to write 1 more CMR review.  The Pearl is interesting to me, the service is ALWAYS good, it seems authentic and original, and the crowd was fun.

The Pearl,578,4,2,2011/1/15,"My partner, me, and two of our friends decided to try something new Friday (10/29) evening.  Our friends chose The Pearl.  I generally find the restaurants in the Short North a little pretentious and over-priced for my taste, but I was open to checking out somewhere I haven't been before.I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere of The Pearl.  Not too flashy or pretentious.  A good mix of different kinds of people, all there for different reasons.   Although I will say the placement of the bar could be better since the front door seems to get a little congested with bar patrons.We sat down and were offered drinks.  I ordered a Slo Gin fiz, my partner ordered a beer, and my friends ordered two other drinks (I forget what).   Our server came back to the table to deliver drinks, and I was informed that they do not have slo gin anywhere in the place.   So, I took the suggestion of the server and got some other type of gin fiz... which pretty much tasted just like a margarita.... but I like margarita's so I was happy.Three of the four of us ordered the Burger.  My partner and I ordered ours ""Medium Well"", and one of our friends ordered it ""Well Done"".   When the burgers arrived, we were hungry and couldn't wait to eat!   I bit into my burger only to realize that it was underdone.   The inside was very pink, and I could taste the blood in my mouth.   The same for my partner's.  Our friend who had ordered the burger ""Well Done"" had what I would consider to be ""Medium Well"".   Aside from the burgers being underdone, the burger itself was good.... but just good... nothing to write home about.   The fries were good, though!Our other friend ordered the ""Catch of the Day"" which was swordfish.  He said it was good, but once again, it wasn't great.Bottom line, I wasn't super impressed.  The bill for the two of us was $50 for two drinks and two burgers.   Frankly, I would have been happier with a couple of burgers from Five Guys, and I would have spent about $30 less.  I will say that the service was pretty good.  Our server was attentive, answered all of our questions, and made suggestions.   I guess I would consider trying it again sometime (and getting something else), but just thinking about the underdone burger turns my stomach a little.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either.  I've had a lot better... especially for the price.",Josh S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,12/15/15,"Excellent! We loved every bit of this restaurant. We didn't try to oysters this time but can vouch for the grilled cheese, meatballs and their signature dessert. Will definitely be back. Pass on the fish and chips.",Joshua R.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,4,11/30/14,"This place it pretty great! Quaint trendy atmosphere, great location in the short north, and a quick walk from hotels downtown even if it's cold out. Ordered:Smoked salmon: flavor profile: 3.5/5 , $11 presentation: 3/5 I love smoked salmon, and this is house smoked. It's thick chunk of salmon rather than sliced salmon. The real take back from this dish is the plain white toast that it's served with. With such a nice piece of salmon I would really like to see Texas toast, brioche, or some other type of toast that isn't so plain. Chicken and waffles: flavor profile: 4/5, $18, presentation 4.5/5This is a great trendy dish, everyone really seems to love chicken and waffles now a days. The waffle seemed a bit dry though and lacking a bit of sweetness in the batter. Devils on horseback: flavor profile: 2/5, $8, presentation 2/5Tried something new, this is a traditional german dish, and needless to say I didn't enjoy it one bit. Very, very creamy, I believe it was a type of mayo. I would not recommend this dish to anyone looking to step out of bounds or don't really know what they're getting into. Bloody Mary: flavor profile 4.25/5, presentation 5/5 This bloody is fantastic! House made bloody mix, which everyone can appreciate. It's a little bit thicker of a drink this is why the give you a miller high life pony beer on the side. This was a great compliment to the drink, and not to mention bang for your buck! Love this little place, and would definitely recommend it for someone else.",Jessie K.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,3,10/16/15,"This place is decent but like every other Cameron Mitchell's restaurant, it's a rip-off of some place in NYC or Chicago or LA... This place sort of looks like he went to Maison Premiere in Williamsburg, BK and copied most of the decor. My last brunch there was anything but awesome. My cappuccino was bland and had to ask for an espresso shot to put into it. The server lied and said there was no bread, only biscuits. Cameron Mitchell is such a pain in the ass guest, that he wants his servers to do anything for the guest. Where's the soy milk and toast, Cameron?Other than that, the food and drinks are usually acceptable. I do like the copper mugs for Moscow Mules.",Andrew W.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,10/15/16,"Their manhattan is my favorite in Columbus! Using luxardo cherries, it's awesome. 4 out of 5 stars because they are so hard to get in to starting on Thursdays and through the weekend (if you don't have reservations). The bar space is pretty limited, so if you're like me and just want to pop in for a drink, it's kind of hard. Otherwise, if you can significantly plan ahead- this place is pretty good!",Nicole T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,10/26/16,"After my visit, I might rename this ""The Imitation Pearl."" It is not a classic oyster bar in the New York or San Francisco style. In fact, there are only a few seafood dishes on the whole menu.Cameron Mitchell restaurants usually feature a theme that they hope to franchise. The problem is, there is no theme here. It's a nice enough place, but the menu is a mish-mash of dishes from fried chicken to Cuban sandwiches, to pork chops. The seafood offerings are sparse and pricey. 3 tiny clams on the half-shell (the clam meat was the size of your fingernail) are $8 and the New Orleans oysters are no larger and cost $11 for 3. The clams were fresh and tasty but the oysters were a cheesy, salty, oily mess. The peel and eat shrimp were large but dry and kind of bland and a poor value at $17 a half pound.My wife was pleased with her braised short ribs and I agreed that they were delicious.Service, like at all CM joints, was prompt and friendly.The wine list was just the right size (not overwhelming) and well thought out. My Chateau de Campuget Rose at $8 a glass was a fair value and excellent.If you're looking for an oyster bar, this is not the place. If you're OK with a typical American bistro menu in a casual, warm and busy neighborhood venue, then The Pearl may be your gem. It was more like cosmetic jewelry to me.",Cmh S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2002/5/16,"There is a fun atmosphere here. The food was absolutely great! The service was excellent and great looking, but my two favorite things about the restaurant were the cornbread and the oysters.",Joan C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2001/5/16,"As with most Cameron Mitchell restaurants the atmosphere/theme is executed to perfection.  the tavern/oyster bar feel is balanced in a very chic way.  The cocktails are always good and the service is always superb.  Every waiter we've had has always been incredible knowledgeable of the menu and has been an excellent help in deciding what to order.   The Chicken Confit Wings are crisp and tasty.  The Spinach Salad is delicious and is great paired with some of the richer menu items. The grilled cheese is heavenly and flavorful.  The short ribs are tender and absolutely delicious, that meal I was a little distracted as Cameron and his family were sitting at the table next to ours so as any foodie fangirl would do I gawked at him most of the time waiting for another genius restaurant idea to come to life as if he just thinks of them constantly.  I digress. Per usual food, service, and atmosphere are all top notch which I've come to expect from any CM restaurant.",Steph M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,11/29/15,"Made reservations and included a note that I was taking my boyfriend out for a special birthday dinner. We arrived very early for our reservation (an hour early), and they said they should be able to get us a table earlier. After waiting 45 minutes, they took us to the worst table in the house, practically in the lobby, surrounded by crowds of people. See the photo. Does this look like a place for a special dinner? Wish we'd gone elsewhere. Update after our meal:I took my boyfriend to The Pearl to celebrate his birthday. It was our first time there, and I made reservations noting that we would be celebrating his birthday. We arrived an hour early for our reservation, figuring we would have a drink at the bar. No such luck, as the bar was packed and people were crammed into the lobby like cattle. The hostess said she would be able to get us in earlier than our reservation. We waited 45 minutes before she took us to the worst table in the house. People were standing elbow to elbow all around the table that was honestly located in the lobby. Does a lobby sound like a good place to have a special dinner? I told the hostess that this was a special birthday dinner and we would rather wait for a better table. We waited until our reservation time and she took us to the 2nd worst table in the house. There was barely enough room to squeeze between tables and our neighbors were 6-8"" away. One of our neighbors had piled their coats taking up half of my seat on the booth side, making it very uncomfortable. The booth also had a seam at my seat, so I sat crooked the whole meal. Because of the ""crammed in like sardines"" table arrangement, the server on our neighbor's table actually placed her butt on my boyfriend's arm several times during the meal. We were utterly disgusted. How can you enjoy a meal with a stranger sitting on you!? She didn't even mention it or apologize, which tells me either she's aloof or it happens all the time. Most disappointing: nobody, from the server to the hostess, even wished my boyfriend a happy birthday. I wasn't expecting cheesy singing or anything, but writing Happy Birthday on the dessert we ordered and paid for, or even just wishing him a happy birthday is the least they could have done. Next time, I will save the $76 I spent on dinner, and instead buy a nice bottle of wine and cook at home or go elsewhere. So utterly disappointed in The Pearl.",Kristen Y.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,11/18/15,"Don't come here if you are vegetarian, pretty much everything is meat, with maybe a few fish options. There is one vegetarian option, the grilled cheese, but you better like Brie, Pear Jam, Roasted Squash, and Arugula Pesto if you're going to order that. I got the Arctic Char, basically because I didn't know what else to order (Fish and Chips are typically really greasy), which was good, but I wish they had had more menu options that were meatless (and not super greasy).",Lizzy B.,,,,,,

I also swear by the cornbread with a warm honeyed-whipped butter, grilled cheese with pear preserves, and the charcuterie. The Pearl has successfully elevated your traditional deviled eggs, and, to state the obvious, offers a generous selection of oysters. I definitely ask the waiter, every time, to steer me in the right direction when ordering the oysters. Do you think I know the difference between east and west coast oysters?

Our waiter had a great enthusiastic attitude, was very knowledgable about the menu, and was very attentive to my needs as a customer. Eric, I believe our waiter's name was, offered multiple menu suggestions, one of which was the tater tot appetizer which I praise him for! I didn't know tater tots could be that good. The ambience was perfect for me-- fancy yet not too formal to where I felt I couldn't laugh loud and enjoy myself (which is exactly what I did thanks to a couple of cocktails). The entire staff impressed me and the staff dress code was something I noticed and really enjoyed, everything was visually pleasing.

Fairly small shrimp were a little  rubbery and the portion size was small (I wasn't full after eating) but it was pretty good.  101 Beer Kitchens shrimp and grits are much better.Would definitely come back for the Oyster Stout but would probably get the chicken or something else.",Adam G.,,,,,,

Too damn good.  Hubs had a Cuban sandwich as his meal and it was tasty - not authentic - but tasty.  I ordered the fried chicken with greens and cinnamon roll.Greens were good, roll was huge but the chicken was not crispy.  I was told by our server that that is the way the chef prepares it.  Me?  If it's fried chicken then I want it to go crunch when I bite into it.   So I asked for a different entree which was the short ribs over fries.  Hardly any short-ribs but plenty of fries and gravy.  Hubs loved it, I didn't so we traded plates.  Even though both of my plated weren't exactly all that good to me I do want to return and try the oysters...and more of those appetizers.",Teri D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2008/9/15,"Meh. Went for brunch with a group of 7. Nice atmosphere, friendly wait staff, coffee was a tad strong for my taste, but then we got the food... Portions are definitely on the small side, which is totally fine, except they're excessively priced. $14 for half a Belgian waffle and a single wing of fried chicken? $14 for ""short rib"" poutine, which came with three barely noticeable pieces of meat, a few cheese curds, and a load of fries swimming in a soup ""gravy"". Rest of the table got the $11 omelette of the day, which was OK, but very light on bacon. I certainly wasn't expecting some grand value given the chef's name, but this was a tad ridiculous.Cut the prices 25%, add more substance to the food, and I'd give it another star, but no amount of hipster vibe can justify these prices for average brunch food. Perhaps dinner is better....",Kevin K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2011/3/14,"Everything was perfect except for one thing...Service was incredible.Wine was excellent.Food preparation, presentation, and taste all very good.The only issue is that the food was not hot. In fact, some of it was cold. I know that waiters can get busy and that this type of thing can happen. So it's not a huge deal.I would recommend this place to a friend.",Scott Z.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,7/22/16,"Went there for happy hour and couldn't have been more pleased. With our oyster shooters and other beverages to start. The lamb meatballs and raw oysters were all very good for a starter. We finished with a Cuban sandwich with black bean stew. All yummy. Our server, Kevin was the best. This is the place in Columbus to visit.",William S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,6/18/17,"The food here is actually good for Ohio, i would reccomend the great lakes fish and chips but my rating is based on host experience, who lied to me four times, his name starts with a k and ends with an n. Red hair, so I ask the guy if the bar tables were a walk in bar sit down and he says no, yet it's obviously a bar, then I said I would like to sit in a real table then, where he replies that the bar table was the only thing he had available. I didn't mind the first few lies just smiled and said okay we will take that then.  As I look to the back to see a lot of empty spaces he starts saying actually we can sit you back here, so now the situation changed, next he starts excusing himself by saying we like to sit everyone close together for serving purposes, I look in the back and a few people are sitting back there, finally I ask him his name and he said his name was Ted, I asked the waitress for his name, who was fantastic btw, and it didn't match what he said",Leon L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2008/10/16,"Had an amazing dinner here! Went to The Pearl after it was highly recommended by many locals we met at the US Senior Golf Open.  We were not disappointed. The Moscow Mule was delicious - one of the best I've had. The Tater Tots were nothing special, would not order them again. The Nawlins Baked Oysters were outstanding!!  They were served with a delicious piece of hot bread. We both had the Shrimp and Grits and thought they were wonderful. Highly recommend this dish. The service was fast, very professional, attentive and friendly. A+ all around. We will definitely return.",Kim S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,9/19/15,"My goodness, this place is wonderful.  Hubby and I were in town for an Ohio State game.  We hadn't been to Columbus in 3 years, so we walked around and found Pearl and looked it up on Yelp.  The food, drinks and service was OUTSTANDING.  I ordered the fried chicken, which tasted just like my mother used to make.  Reminded me of my childhood.  It was tasty and juicy.  Came with collards and a sticky bun, which was light and fluffy. Also had the Moscow Mule drink.  The best drink ever.Hubby had a Cuban sandwich and he loved it.  Our waiter was fantastic.  He knew the menu and made recommendations based on my tastes and he was spot on.  Going back for the bruch..  Great restaurant.",Susan F.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,8/26/15,"Not what I was expecting, too bad!Went to the Pearl for my one night in Columbus. I heard great things and my work colleagues and I decided to go. Service was poor and the food was mediocre. Our appetizer came out after our salads. The devil dates were good, not great. The spinach salads were  bland. I had the short ribs and asked for a different vegetable selection. 30 minutes after we ordered the meal came out - wrong.  The ribs were good. Finally, ordered coffee and Brown Sugar pie. Coffee came within the cream and sugar. Got the cream. Had to flag another waiter to get sugar for my now warm coffee. Slightly saving grace - Brown Sugar pie was delicious. There was no attention to detail. Overall I'd rate the whole experience a B- and would not go back. There are too many restaurants in the area to spend your money: try somewhere else!",Clayton H.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2008/5/16,Loved it....great food right in the heart of the Short North...Folks were friendly and service was great.  I live in CA but when I come back this weekend I am going here for sure :),Laura U.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,8/23/15,"Nice setting. The oysters were delicious. The Bloody Mary good. Then came my eggs with no toast or potatoes. Downhill from there. The best food can be ruined by mediocre service. For the prices charged, I expected excellent service.",Kathleen N.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,2/23/17,"Although the food was outstanding, the service left a bad taste in my mouth. We waited about 45 minutes past our reservation, which was originally a 45 minute wait, only to be greeted by further slower service.",Nick G.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,5/16/15,"Apparently at The Pearl it is frowned upon to stand by the bar drinking overpriced refreshments while waiting to be seated.  So came here with two other couples, while the 3 ladies sat at the bar sipping their $10 cocktails the guys stood near with beer in hand collecting a dirty death stare from the hostess every time she bristled by us. A rather uninviting situation, especially considering we arrived 15 minutes before our reservation and continued to wait for almost another hour until we blew that popsicle stand and found a more welcoming atmosphere - which in the Short North they're a plenty.Bad experience overall; bottomline, don't even waste your time attempting to check out this overly pretentious place. btw - if you order the 3 oysters on a half shell app (yes folks I said 3 as in 1,2,3 - strange when you're used to ordering them by the dozen), sorry I digress, so when you get the 1,2,3 oysters for a mere $8 and at that price expect to find a 'real pearl' in those oysters... prepare to be disappointed!!",Hua R.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,4,5/21/14,"Many of Cameron Mitchell's restaurants have happy hour deals, but I think happy hour at The Pearl is my favorite. The selection isn't as extensive as Marcella's, but I think that the options you get are the best. My roomie and I stopped by around 4:30pm on a Friday and managed to snag a tall bar area table by the window, and we sampled the following items: 1) Ramos gin fizz cocktail - I love refreshing citrusy drinks that aren't too sweet, and this fits the bill. It has egg whites in it which give it a cool foamy texture, and it was perfectly balanced.2) Moscow mule cocktail - roomie's drink, pretty standard but really great. Moscow mule is one of my favorite relatively standard cocktails, and this was one of the better ones that I've had.3) Jalapeno corn spoon bread - so. crazy. Get this. Sounds standard, I dunno what they do but it's incredibly addictive. The jalapeno gives it extra oomph but it's not spicy at all if you're worried.4) Chicken wing confit - standard but maybe not my favorite, they're just chicken wings that have been fried. The texture is actually a little tougher than what I hope for, the happy hour wings at Harrison's are better. 5) Baked oysters - these are a steal and taste amazing, I really wish that I had ordered more but I was getting full and we were planning to eat elsewhere later.Overall, wonderful meal and the place is just so pretty. One minor mishap is that we had added the pork belly taco but I think the server forgot and didn't put the order in, then kept checking in on us cause we were lingering for awhile waiting for it, but the service was good otherwise. These's a few other items on the happy hour menu like those tacos that I'd like to return for and I'd even be interested in coming back for the regular menu, so I'll be back.",Helen S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2/21/17,"AMAZING! Do yourself a favor and get the smoked salmon and charcuterie board, good heavens! SO TASTY! My husband and I can't get enough, plus great cocktails! A++",Susan H.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,7/21/15,"I've been waiting to try The Pearl for a while now. We went here on a Sunday night pretty early, around 6 or 6:30. I wasn't sure how busy this place was on Sundays but can tell you from walking around the Short North - it's PACKED on Friday and Saturday. Ends up we definitely did not need a reservation, traffic picked up a little but not really until we were finished eating.Our server was perfect! Very friendly but not overbearing. He helped me pick out a nice Pino Noir based off of what I usually like. It was absolutely delicious.We decided to try the small plate of Lamb Meat Balls. The lamb was great and the marinara was very fresh. There was a cream sauce too, not sure what it was, but it was zesty and I couldn't get enough! We also decided to get the Smoked Salmon app. This came with a couple pieces of toast, (didn't do much for me) and a devil-ish-ly good egg. I thought the salmon was very good and the nice smokey flavor that wasn't over powered by the tarter sauce that was on top. Once our server rattled off the special I decided immediately that's what I would get. The special was an Amberjack filet with a side of tomatoes, fingerling potatoes, zucchini, yellow squash and an olive tapenade. The flavors were really good and clean. This was a very light dish - thank god! The only thing I question is the Amberjack. I haven't had this type of fish before so maybe this is normal? Most of the filet was very light and fell right apart but there were a few bites that were tough and fatty.  I'll have do some research on this, but I can say I didn't enjoy those (very few) bites. For desert you have one choice.... pies! Looking at the choices I decided the Brown Sugar pie sounded the most interesting. This is now my official new favorite desert. This pie was sooo freaking good!!! It's not too sweet and had amazing flavor and texture. I'm sure the rest of the pies are just as good but if you want something different you cannot go wrong with this! I will definitely be back and can't wait to try some of the other dishes on the menu!",S G.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,11/18/15,"I love the Pearl. Dinner food is great, I yearn to try their brunch, but I'm going to focus on their happy hour.Half off all apps and shareables, half off [basically] all drinks. Wow. The house made tater tots, jalapeno corn bread, and the meatballs. All so good. I wish I had time to go for happy hour every night. And the service is always excellent, not pretentious.Have continued and will continue to go back.",David W.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2006/11/16,"Best restaurant in Columbus!  Favorite dishes include: deviled eggs, tuna, beet salad, oysters, flank steak with kimchi and the cornbread.  The drinks are great too--especially the Bloody Mary.  The only things I haven't enjoyed are the poutine and the burger but everything else has been excellent.  Pearl has a happy hour during the week which is really good value too!I still love this place but went for brunch today and it was a bit inconsistent from the last 4 or so times we've been.  The hangar steak was good but the rice/kimchi were a bit greasy not crispy/flavorful like usual.  The stuffed French toast which is usually oozing with deliciousness left a bit to be desired and the poached eggs were not properly done.  Also, the serving platters for the deviled eggs have rust on them which I'm fairly certain is not healthy to ingest.",Lauren C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,9/30/15,"I came to Columbus to visit my sister who goes to Ohio State. This was actually my first time in Ohio period. I came to the pearl to visit my sister (who works as a host there) and was blown away by their food and drinks. The exec. Chef brought over a few snacks to start, I don't know the name but you need to order it. (Chicken wing dish and stuffed dates dish) AMAZING! Then I had a half dozen oysters and being that Ohio is not very close to the ocean, I was questioning the freshness...they were actually better than the oysters I've had in Southern California! For my main dish, I absolutely loved the short rib poutine (not sure if I spelled it right). As for libations...the Manhattan and their bloody Mary's are top notch. I will be in Columbus for 5 days and need to go back to try more of their menu! ITS THAT GOOD!",Ryan P.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,8/31/15,"After my first visit to The Pearl, all I could think of was how GOOD everything was. I started with a Moscow Mule that was served in a proper mule mug with amazing crushed ice. So refreshing, make is a second please.The decor is cool, we were trying to decide where its inspiration came from. We settled on a sort of old western speakeasy fusion which doesn't make much sense now that I type it out. Food. Devils on Horseback. Yum. I still can't remember exactly what these are, but they were delicious. The pot of pickles is literally just what it says, a bowl full of tasty pickles, and exactly what I was looking for. Shrimp & Grits, also yum. These were unlike any shrimp and grits I have ever had; it was more like a stew than anything. Still, wow, with the kick of the peppers and the unique addition of short ribs, everything came together to form a fantastic dish. Service: good and friendly. A little slow. I think this was on purpose. The Pearl seems like a place where no one is in a hurry and you are encouraged to relax. The check came out in a unique manner (won't ruin it for you) and we had fun counting the number of lewd drawings on said medium.",Mike C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,8/17/15,"This was my husband's choice for his birthday dinner; he had been before but I hadn't.  It's very pretty and I was impressed they seated us 30 min. earlier than our reserved time.  Good thing, since the bar was full.  We had a cozy corner in the back and a great server.  We each had a cocktail and the deviled eggs appetizer.  Very good.  We both chose that evening's special, which was a red snapper entree with squash.  We both loved it.  The fish and vegetables were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  We had beer and wine with our dinner as well.  We did not do dessert since we were pretty full.  It was a really nice experience and I would probably return.",Anna H.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,7/23/15,"Second time here and I was impressed.  Came around 7 and there was about a 30 min wait for a table, but there were open seats at the bar so we grabbed those.  We started off with the Jalapeno Corn Bread, which had a really nice balance of textures, and the honey and whipped butter that comes with it are perfect.  For my entree I had their Catch of the Day, which ended up being a Thai curry stew with shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams, and some other kind of fish (I blanked when the waiter explained...oops).  It was a lot of food and kinda pricey at $30, but it was so good I didn't care.  The dish had subtle Thai flavors and a nice spicy kick that didn't overwhelm the dish.  Gotta say I was very happy with it.  For dessert we split their Peach and Strawberry Cobbler and added a scoop of Graeter's ice cream to further indulge.  Praise, this dish was heaven.  The crumbly crust on this pie was to die for and the fruit inside were fresh and tasty.  Oh and that ice cream...whole nother level.  Drink menu is also pretty good here if you're into that.  They offer valet parking for $8, but there are also plenty of meters in the area.  Cool place.",Zach T.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,2,2012/10/16,This is probably my least favorite restaurant so far down town first off my sister wanted to come here for her birthday so we made a reservation which they got us in pretty quickly. But after that everything want down hill from there not only did it take almost an hour to get our food to our table; but they also messed up on my sisters salad which then took another 25 mins for them to try and fix it. Usually when you are seated at a table; your waiter is suppose to come back and check up on you to make sure everything was ok but that didn't really happen period cause he only come back twice.The worst part was when after we got up from our table we saw him taking a shot with two other male clients that had him as their waiter. If your going to work in the restaurant business do what your suppose to do and don't take any offered shots by any of the customers when your on the clock. But overall I won't be coming back.,Thao V.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,4/28/14,"We were in town to visit friends and go to a show at the Ohio Theater. We went to The Pearl. It is in a good location and is a nice space. I thought the food was good but not exceptional. The craft beer selection is very good. Our server was friendly and helpful answering our questions. The appetizers were not very good. The jalapeno corn bread did not have much kick at all. I am not sure there were any jalapenos in it. The sausage sampler was just ok. The entrees were better. The ladies split shrimp and grits and the chicken that came with a cinnamon role. They both enjoyed their meals. I had the short ribs. I thought they were good but not memorable in any way. I would try other places before coming back to The Pearl.",Matthew C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,12/31/16,"My love and i decided to try this restaurant out for our new years celebration. The atmosphere in here was lovely.  Being foodies We ordered a sampling of many things.  The lamb meat balls were so moist and fabulous.  We ordered the deviled eggs and although the flavor was not necessarily anything unique the delightful way they were displayed was a whimsical addition to our dining experience.  The smoked salmon was perfectly flaky, tasty and served with toast and another egg. The parmisan oysters were a little gritty but not enough to over cast the rich flavor.  As my partner bit into the jalapeÌ±o bread she gasped how moist the bread was and she delighted in the honey butter served with it.  I even had a small bite (i am not able to eat spicy food) and found it not to be hot but sweet and delicious. Our meat platter arrived with mutiple meats, cavier, pate and pickles. I personally loved the chicken pate jelly and had a hard time not eating it all and stealing it from my partner.  The mustard caviar was my least fave on the board but my partner enjoyed it. Our entrees consisted of grlled cheese, which was fabulous with a hint of a sweet texture and served with a light dressed arugula. Riccota dumplings in a tasty sauce and fish and chips.  The dumplings had a nice textile to them and although they could used an option to add some kind of meat, if you wanted, were flavorful.  The fries on the fish and chips tasted old and over warmed, but the server mark offered to have new made.  As i declined he removed them from the bill.  The fish is definately the star of this meal.  It's flavor was crunchy and light, moist and perfect. The Cole slaw was fresh and the house made hot sauce was my partners favorite. Finally we tried some of the restaurants pies. Our server brought out the strawberry chocolate pie for us to share. The dark chocolate mixed with the light and delicious filling was Devine accompanied by the strawberry.  We took home the Elvis, which is more of a custard whip than a pie, but the filing is not over powering and the pie was perfectly sweet without a sugar coma taste.  My partner had the dutch apple and deemed it very good. The service was perfect.  Our server made sure our silverware was changed at each course and everything was at a perfect pace.",Katheryn N.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2011/8/15,"We always sit at the bar- always great service. Love the atmosphere of this place.Would recommend the jalapeÌ±o cornbread and the pumpkin pie. You can tell it was homemade and it was amazing.",Erin P.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,7/14/15,"Typical Cameron Mitchell.  Everything is tight and perfect.  Here's the rub.  It was lunch time and I asked if they served 6oz beer portions instead of the usual 12 oz.  Many places around town are doing this now and it is really nice to have this option.  Server said ""no problem"" in true Cameron Mitchell style.  No issues, he can do my request.He served my beer in a 12oz glass, filled to the half mark.  Okay, he delivered as he said he would and they didn't have a proper glass.  The bill comes and he charges me the full $7 price.  Bummer for him and bummer for Cameron Mitchell.  He should have told me up front, but he slips the price in at the end.  Bad form.

The Pearl,578,4,4,12/30/16,"So, this review is based on 2 visits. I have to start by saying that both visits delivered excellent service staff who made great recommendations. The first visit also brought with it amazing raw oysters. However, the raw oysters during my second visit looked like they had been handled by an inexperienced shucker. They were mangled and shriveled in their shells and the water was dumped out. Two of the biggest violations when serving raw oysters! That said, the experiences overall have been really great, but I hope they take some time to make sure each of the relevant staff members is appropriately trained in shucking and serving raw oysters.",Lauren W.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,3,2004/11/15,"While in Columbus on business, we came here last night for dinner.  Even with a reservation, it took the restaurant over 45 minutes to seat us.  Apparently, they were running really behind.Our server (can't remember his name) was very friendly and attentive and gave some great suggestions on food.  I was between the Fried Chicken and the burger, and he suggested the burger all the way.  I also ordered a Moscow Mule for the first time.The other ladies at the table ordered the following: clam chowder and spinach salad, another burger, the dumplings, the fried chicken, and some curds to start.The curds were ok, but I think it was because I really wasn't in the mood for those.Didn't get to try any of the other items, but my burger was good and the fries were yummy.  The only issue I had was the cheese that came with the burger(not a big brie or gorgonzola cheese fan).  I did however, order my burger with bacon!I was already full so I didn't order any dessert, but some of the other gals ordered the strawberry pie, the pecan pie and the brown sugar butter pie.  And of course I did try those.  My fav was the brown sugar butter pie.  It was AMAZING.  If I were to come back it would be for that!Overall, ok.  If they are running behind on reservations and you are hungry, try sitting at the bar or finding another spot to eat cause you may be waiting a while like we did. :-(",Martha G.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,5/16/15,"We went to the Pearl twice while we were in Columbus. The first time we went with a group for drinks and sat in the couches in the front. My husband and I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich to share. It was very sweet but the salad it was served with balanced the sweetness. We returned for brunch on Sunday and the place was packed. We shared the spoon bread, which came with butter and honey. I ordered a house salad and the waiting staff forgot to bring the dressing until we were finished eating. My husband ordered the Cuban sandwich (because he can't get enough of that in Miami).

The Pearl,578,4,2,3/23/16,"Perhaps the Pearl had an off night but I've been sitting here in my hotel room for the past hour deciding whether or not to give 1 or 2 stars.  Honestly one of the worse experiences in 30 years and I travel the world.  I also had a client with me and 2 colleagues and they were also disgusted.  Keep in mind 2 live here.  I live by the ocean in Charleston and my client lives in Washington, DC.  She loves seafood...1.  600pm reservation and they couldn't find it even though I showed them the confirmation email.2. Requested a table for leg space in a quiet area and we were seated in a booth.  Absolutely cramped.3. Appetizers ordered 2 orders of baked oysters, 2 orders of baked clams, 6 raw clams and 6 raw Blue Points. VOMIT!  Long story short all of it was sent back.  Why?  Shells and dirt in the food and after sending 2 pieces back for being bad the new pieces they brought were puke bad. I still have the taste in my mouth.  Why would I ever think a restaurant in Columbus can serve shell fish, especially raw.  Waiter said they threw away all the clams and oysters that were in the case and opened up new bags.  HELLO.  Nasty nasty nasty. BTW.  Blue Points this time of year are twice the size so your distributor is selling you the ""b or c"" rated oysters.  Hire someone who can buy good seafood. 4. Dirty martini came not dirty and served in a margarita glass. LOL  I'm not kidding.  Ordered 2 draft beers and they were good because it masked the bad taste in my mouth.  Beer was a little warm. 5. Entry 1 fish and chips - wasn't finished by guest 1 and didn't want doggy bad.  Can you say greasy greasy greasy. Also they should serve thicker filets. Entry 2 shrimp and grits!  LOL! Spending the past 20 years in Atlanta and Charleston please take this off your menu. Where's the beef....I mean grits!!!  At least the shrimp were cleaned correctly.  Entry 3 short ribs - or I mean fatty ribs.  Good Lord where is the meat!  Sorry but they were appetizer portion and full of fat.  Entry 4 - steak but where is the beef.  Crazy!!!6. Service C+ but he tried and we felt bad for him because all he did was apologize all night.  Not his fault and he did get all appetizers taken off the bill but he was a bit clueless. Maybe he was new. Perhaps a 4 star restaurant in Columbus but wouldn't last 3 months in Atlanta or Charleston. For those of you that have posted 5 stars please get out more often.  This is a 1-2 star restaurant on a good day. Can't believe I still paid almost $200!!!  Glad I'm going home in the morning!!!",Brent L.,,,,,,

Definitely interested in the oysters the next time I'm in town.",Scott H.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,5/23/15,"Dining at the Pearl feels like popping into a (fancy) pub in New England. The decor is clean and modern but rustic- think dark wood contrasted with subway tile. The servers plaid shirts are cheesy but effective (and honestly I've had worse work uniforms). We have never received less than stellar service.The drinks menu features a fun mix of classics and original concoctions. I am a dedicated consumer so I've tried lots of them. #hero. When we go here, we always start with a platter of half dozen oysters, no matter what. I have yet to have a bad oyster here- they've always been fresh, briny, and delicious. What's more, I appreciate the staff's expertise in the oysters. They are always able to describe the tastes and textures of each enjoyable little mollusk. For a main, sometimes I will get one or two of the appetizer/small plate situation- I love the deviled eggs and the jar of pickles, and I've tried almost all the salads, and have yet to be disappointed. I've also ordered off the traditional menu and have loved the chicken and waffles, the steak, the burger, and whatever cuts of fish they are serving at the moment. Despite the fact that it's always busy here, the staff is pleasant and professional. I've had good luck with large-ish groups as well as popping in unannounced with a friend for Happy Hour (which by the way is great).If you haven't tried the Pearl yet, please go. Get a couple of oysters. Grow up, they're delicious.",Meg K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2008/2/15,"BRUNCH! was freakin amazing. Service was top notch, atmosphere comfortable, food was spectacular. I ordered the Tavern Bentley and my hubby ordered the chicken and waffles. We shared the stuffed french toast, which I highly highly recommend!!! Hubby said the Bloody Mary was the best he's ever had. If I wasn't pregnant I would have gotten one myself! Best meal I've had in a long time! :)",Rachel J.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2011/2/16,It's average at best. There aren't many choices of food. The oysters are fresh and delicious but there aren't many options. The service took forever. Won't come back.,Mike S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2/28/14,"Amazing happy hour and cool atmosphere...I have tried many places in the Short North, but The Pearl is one of my favorites. My friend and I hit up happy hour for the cheese curds, gourmet grilled cheese, and oysters washed down with a few house beers. I also celebrated a birthday there. The service was great and they brought a piece of pecan pie on the house. The atmosphere makes for an exquisite experience - trendy, cool vibes, vintage furnishings, high tables and bar stools, and top-notch bar.Hands down, The Pearl gets it right!",Megan V.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,2003/3/14,"This was the first time that my date and I have been to this restaurant. Absolutely delicious!! We ordered the Parmesan Baked Clams to start. Utterly delectable. They were gone in seconds!  We also ordered cocktails (Moscow Mule and a raspberry drink).  The Moscow Mule was recommended by the waiter and it was very good.We ordered Today's Catch (salmon) and the Arctic Char. Both dishes were well-prepared.  They each had a crispy outer layer, which made the fish taste so delicious!All in all, the food was amazing. We would both recommended this place to our family and friends.  And, we would definitely come back again.",Cyrus C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,1/25/14,"The decor here is absolutely beautiful and sophisticated. Thank goodness for happy hour so a poor grad student like me can afford to eat here. I started out with a moscow mule, which kinda just tasted like lemonade with a tiny hint of vodka. I think it has either too much ginger beer or has been diluted down with water. My friends had their IPAs, which they were happy with.I got a few orders of oysters, baked and raw ($3 for 2 oysters). The baked one was seasoned with different cheese and was crispy and good, but the oysters looked smaller than the ones they serve raw for some reason. The raw oysters come with 2 types of sauce and lemon. I enjoyed the raw ones more, but that's because it just tasted less fatty and fresher. The pork belly taco was good. I asked for some hot sauce and that went superbly with it. My couple of my friends ordered the chi town dogs which looked really good and filling. For the same price, they also had smoked salmon, which I got to sample - tasted ok. I also sampled the nuts & kettle corn, which tasted like ordinary honey roasted nuts and kettle popcorn - nothing special.Overall, my bill was about $18 and i wasn't entirely satisfied. I would say I get a better happy hour value at marcella's but I'd come back here for the oysters.Oh! A nice touch at the end was each of our bills were given in hardcover books. This is the first place I've seen doing this. It gives a very nice touch.",Karyn M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,4/23/16,"Loved it starred off with the calm chowder some of the best chowder have and I've lived in boston.....next I had the bacon and parmesan cheese crusted clams had a little to strong of the parmesan but we're superb none the less and left me wanting more and the  I had the braised short rib and it was so tender you could smash it against the plate,I can not say enough about that short rib it was juicy and the flavors works so well with each other,all in all I am in love with the Pearl and is definitely a new favorite spot of mine.",Steven W.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,4,2011/11/13,"I joined a friend for dinner here recently and had a great time.The downside: The bar is small and packed. If you plan to have dinner, you need a reservation well in advance and even if you show up on time, it is likely you will have to wait up to 30 minutes for your table to be ready.The upside: The atmosphere is great, the menu has something for everyone. If you are a raw bar person, they have a great selection and every one of them is delish. If you aren't a raw bar person, they have a killer burger and fries and also a yummy Brie grilled cheese. You should try:The moscow mule (it comes in a copper mug - vodka and ginger beer with mint)The oysters (some of every kind)The Pimms punch (comes in a mason jar - cranberries galore - pretty and sweet)The grilled cheese (Brie brie brie - oh yum)The desserts (The cobbler is TDF)Once you are seated the dining room is great. We had a booth in the back and sat and talked for hours. The bill came and I was like.. That's all? I was thinking it was going to be  ALOT MORE.They were slow on the dessert and to make up for that, they didn't add it to the bill... so that was really nice as well.They offer valet at $6",Corey Tess T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,3/26/14,"Finally stopped into The Pearl one busy Saturday night with Bryant M. It was as excellent as everyone I've spoken with says.We sat at the kitchen/oyster bar (what do you call that bar by the kitchen?) and it was so low-key compared to the crush of people just a wall away. It took a little bit of time to get menus but hey, busy Saturday night, we get it. After our orders were taken, everything came out quickly.And everything was really tasty. The devils on horseback are a must-try if you like bacon; the sausage sampler was good. I got a bourbon and apple punch that I wish had been just a tiny bit sweeter, but it was also (surprise!) really good. Service was excellent, too. I love how they leave water with you so that you don't have to try to flag down a server for a refill. I drink water like ... like something that drinks a lot of water, idk. I drink a lot of water. It was nice to have it. And the check comes in an actual book! Being a book blogger that tickled me--though they should consider pasting in some library card holders for credit cards (if they haven't already, I didn't look that closely, I admit), as mine fell out and almost skittered into the kitchen.Looking forward to taking my husband here on a date.",Susie R.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2001/12/15,"Came here for happy hour with a few friends. The food itself had some up and down points, but their service could use a bit of work. We had one order (pork belly taco) not show up for almost an hour (whilst everything else came out within 20 minutes), and we also had an order of oysters just completely go missing. Both those orders were refunded/comped, but our waitress didn't seem particularly concerned about the fact that food was simply going missing. Also, since we were seated near the window that lets you look into the kitchen, we had the pleasure of seeing someone drop an entire case of oysters onto the floor. That definitely doesn't leave a good impression... Now, onto actual food: Oysters - We tried the mild, salty, and sweet oysters. The mild and sweet were not bad, but the salty oysters were pretty small and not really even worth the happy hour price. Also, whoever is shucking the oysters needs a lesson in how to do it properly, because we kept getting oyster pieces in our mouths.Jalapeno Corn Spoon Bread - One of the few dishes I'm actually glad I ordered. The whipped butter and honey really nicely compliments the cornbread, which was warm and fluffy but not too flavored. House Smoked Salmon - Definitely regret getting this. Perhaps a misunderstanding on our part, but when we read ""smoked salmon,"" we were expecting the type of smoked salmon you get on bagels, not a giant chunk of salmon smoked on a grill. The portion size was generous, but the dish itself was still not really worth getting. Pork Belly Taco - Whatever they were trying to do, it was not ""korean style BBQ"" as far as I, an Asian person who spent 5 years roaming LA's Koreatown, am concerned. The sauce was also pretty underwhelming, but (as with the salmon) I do give them credit for giving a good size portion of meat. Chicken Wing Confit - Literally just chicken wings that may or may not have had a tiny bit of spiciness? Not bad wings, but not worth $4 for 4 wings... Short Rib Sloppy Joe - Pretty much what you'd expect. The poppy seed bun was very tasty, but nothing else really stood out. Overall, not necessarily disappointed in the experience, but not very impressed either.",Ying X.,,,,,,

Yet to try anything I haven't liked off the menu but Oysters are delicious (as expected), as is the cornbread, hangar steak, and the short rib.  Ive walked in and been seated pretty quickly a couple of times but would definitely recommend booking ahead if you can as space is a bit restricted and not ideal having to loiter at the front when it's busy.  Will definitely go back again. And again.",Sam K.,,,,,,

Dinner consisted of braised short ribs which was super tender, with horseradish mashed potatoes and julienned vegetables-oh so good! Another dish of the steak, which is citrus marinated and cooked perfectly medium rare with kimchi rice and side of veggies-super delectable! From the looks of another patrons dinner of roasted chicken it looked fresh and moist and perfectly plated. For drinks, we had the famous Moscow mules and they were tasty!

The Pearl,578,4,4,8/14/16,"There is no doubt that the pearl is a great dining establishment. On our last visit there, several service mistakes were made and all were promptly rectified without our asking. We ended up with three rounds of free drinks due to errors made by the waiter and hostess. Being  at a Cameron Mitchell restaurant, we knew we would leave satisfied even though the beginning of our night started off rocky. We went on national oyster day and needless to say the pearl was packed. They struggled to keep up but instead of giving us excuses they gave us sincere apologies and freebies. That's what makes them a world class business. The food is excellent, too. I highly recommend the smoked salmon appetizer and of course, oysters. They have different varieties from around the world all with different flavor profiles. As always, my favorite time to go is happy hour, where you get half off drinks and shares/snacks plus some of the sandwiches. Definitely worth a visit (or ten)!",Betsy C.,,,,,,

We had reservations, which I do recommend because even at 945 people were waiting. Our waiter was wonderful. Atmosphere is fun. Waiter brought us a free appetizer (deviled eggs) and dessert (a banana peanut butter pie--amazing), both of which were delicious. We loved it so much that we went back the next morning for brunch. Also received a free appetizer of cornbread (the best I've ever had). Biscuits and gravy were wonderful. The staff is the nicest I've experienced in a long time.

The Pearl,578,4,2,2001/2/16,"I've always been a fan of C.M. restaurants, but The Pearl may be biting off a little more than they can chew. About 2 months ago I made reservations for 7:15 on NYE here, that's 2 months advance notice. A week before NYE The Pearl called to confirm that I would be there at 7:15, and I was, with the 3 other people who I was having dinner with. We stood in a packed, uncomfortable foyer and waited to be sat for 45 minutes. When we finally got a seat at 8, it was in the bar area in which we kept getting ran into by patrons standing at the bar. With that said, it leaves me to wonder if they would have sat me had I gotten there 45 minutes past reservation time, let's be honest, probably not, but on NYE, they know that we were left with little choice but to wait out our turn because any restaurant worth anything was going to be full on NYE. Let's move on. The fried chicken, amazing, Devils on horseback, love them, Moscow mule, the best in town. Problem here, we only got one drink each because our server never really came back to see if we needed another. Hopefully next year, The Pearl can accommodate all of the guests that they ""think"" they can.",Amber S.,,,,,,

All just so so in my opinion...other than the salad which I really enjoyed.  Cheese curds - bland. Fish - too much breading and the fries were cold.

Well, the little one wasn't impressed on that one, but we managed to fight over the last bite.We finally made it here for a mini-celebration brunch.

Crisp delicious bacon, too.Tavern Benny-Pappa thought it was good, but not the best dish at the table.Kid's meal grilled cheese-it was a darn good grilled cheese! and the little one ate nearly the entire thing.Moscow Mule-Here's my advice, buy the cup. Those copper mugs are $20 online (without a drink in it). Hubby now wants a set, so we will be back and buying them here! It's a little pricy cocktail  for the amt of ice, but it was tasty!Bloody Mary-One of the best I've drank.

This is definitely Columbus's top spot (from the amount of people trying to get a seat) and it took an hour before we could get a reservation. Had the clam chowder which was really good  Had the hanger steak which was quite flavorful but the chef was really heavy with the salt which kind of messed up the experience. Overall the staff was really helpful and respectful which was good.

The Pearl,578,4,3,9/19/16,"First time I went it was pretty good. Not the most amazing food ever but not disappointing. All of the tables are pretty close together so you don't get much privacy, but you kind of know that going into it. The decorations are awesome. Got the seafood tower the second time and it was very underwhelming. In hindsight I wish they'd tell you the price for the day (you feel awkward asking-$90 when we went if anyone is wondering) and let you know what all is on it. The crab salad was veryy mayonnaise-y with not much flavor. Also it had a gross black hair in it. Waitress offered a replacement crab salad to go but that is definitely not a to go leftover type food...didn't offer anything else, but we didn't make a huge stink of it. The oysters were mostly really good (and were last time as well) but some were pretty sandy. Mostly just grossed out by the raw clams. We wrongly assumed they would be steamed. There were like 13 of them and we both gagged after eating the first: they were so fishy and slimy. I felt pretty queasy later that night and had only choked down two. Hostesses not the friendliest but the servers have been very nice. Not super speedy, but I totally get that and don't mind at all when it is crowded. For the prices vs. what you get, I'd recommend Philco diner right down the street...so delicious every time we go.",Kelly E.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,1,3/13/17,"We went to The pearl becasue of the ratings on Yelp and it was a Cameron Mitchell restaurant.  The hostess was cold and expressionless.  We asked for the warm spot in the restaurant because my elderly mom is very sensitive to the cold.  After ordering, there was a fierce cold breeze (it was 30 degrees outside).  Right down the hall from our table was  the back door where waiters traipsed in and out with the garbage.   There was also a scented candle in the hall so the smell permeated the air around us.  It only got worse.  My husband and I ordered shrimp and grits.  It was mediocre at best and the serving was small.  My dad ordered the short rib dinner.  He said it was pot roast in disguise and not very good at all.  Then a waiter propped open the back door.   We told our server.  he did move us.  So we ate dinner in our coats freezing and the food was mediocre.  We complained to the manager and she gave us a coupon for $50.  Our meal came to $100.  There is no way we are going back.  Fortunately the coupon is good for any Cameron Mitchell restaurant.  I hope the next one is better. Our waiter was nice though.",Diane G.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2/21/13,"Fairly decent food but overly priced.  That is how I'd sum up my experience at The Pearl.My dinner date and I had booked a reservation for Valentine's Day.  I had been eagerly anticipating this restaurants' opening for months.  I am a raw oyster fanatic and while their oysters were tasty, they were way over priced at $3 each.  The average price for oysters in Columbus is probably $2.  I didn't feel that the oysters at The Pearl were any more fresh than other restaurants I've been to.  I also would have liked to see each variety of oyster labeled on the platter they are served on.  I ordered 3 different kinds of oysters, but wasn't told which was which when they were served.Happy Hour is Mon-Fri from 4-6 and consists of half off starters and drafts.  I tried the crispy fried cheese curds.  They were crispy on the outside, gooey and delicious on the inside and finished off with awesome fried bits of parsley sprinkled on top.  I also tried the Devils on Horseback which are chese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon.  I loved the balance of sweet and savory.  To wet the ol whistle, I ordered their Moscow Mule which was served in a copper mug as a mule should.  It was good, but nothing special.  I would have liked a stronger punch of ginger.My entree was probably the biggest disappointment of my experience.  I ordered the fish and chips.  At $16, I was expecting to taste something unique or at least a damn good fried fish.  It was ok, but lacked anything to make it memorable.  Our waitress was very attentive, but probably too attentive.  She literally came over to ask if we were ok every 3 minutes or less.  It kind of made it hard to enjoy my meal and my date's company when she was there every freaking minute.  I'd like to come back sometime and try the House smoked salmon or charcuterie board.",Stephanie K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2002/5/13,"It was love at first sight. And then it was love (again) at first bite.The Pearl was a sensory overload for me because the space is equally as beautiful as the food is delicious. But I'll get into the details a little later...Picture it: The middle of January, and I wander over to Open Table to see if - by some slim chance - The Pearl was already accepting reservations. And the search results? 7pm on opening night!Fast forward to tonight. Most restaurant opening nights are honestly a mess. But that's part of the fun, right? I was totally expecting the worst and was just going to happily go along for the ride. But guess what? The Pearl's opening night wasn't a mess - not even a little bit! It wasn't perfect, but it was perfectly charming. I think ""thoughtful"" is the best way to describe everything at The Pearl. There isn't one detail left forgotten - whether it's the everything-from-scratch food, the beautiful-but-rustic ambiance, or the exceptional service. Here's a little more about each of those...The decor is exactly what I would do if I were building a house and had unlimited funds. Think: hardwood floors, rustic wooden tables, white-painted brick, glass accessories, and subway tiles. The serving plates were white, the silverware mis-matched, and mason jars for glasses. The bathrooms, although small, were showpieces of their own with dark wood and subway tiles in white, gray, and teal. Everything was beautiful without being fussy - just the way I like it.Before dinner, our table decided to order a bowl of bourbon apple punch. And it came out in a punch bowl. The crystal kind. Like Grandma had. It was totally adorable, and the punch was super tasty.The food was a delightful paradox: familiar, yet unexpected and down-home, yet up-scale. Here's what our table shared and a grade (just for fun):* Pork belly bau buns - A+* Devils on horseback (bacon-wrapped dates, stuffed with five cheese) - A* Fried cheese curds with gravy for dipping (like a less-messy poutine) - A-* Fried chicken, Southern-style greens, and a cinnamon bun - A+* Cuban sandwich (B-) with black bean soup (A) - B average* Grilled cheese with brie and pear jam - BThe fried chicken was my dish, and this is a pretty bold declaration: it's the best fried chicken in Columbus. If you're a fan of Maya's fried chicken truck, you'll love The Pearl's. The pieces were small, which is great because there's more crispies and you don't have to worry about the chicken not being cooked all the way through. The greens were the best I've had outside of my native Louisiana. And the cinnamon bun? To. Die. For.As for the service, Jesse was our server, and he couldn't have been better. I think he had first-night jitters, but who wouldn't? He was insanely attentive, and we were never left wanting a thing. A server who keeps my water glass constantly filled is A-okay in my book. Jesse really cared about our experience, and he frequently checked on us. This was top-notch service.I think The Pearl is what I always wanted Hubbard Grille to be. If you're like me and looking for a special night out that's still casual and fun, you're going to love The Pearl. This is totally going to be my new date-night spot. In fact, we already have reservations for Valentine's Day.",Bryant M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2008/12/14,"The decor and ambiance here is wonderful! I met up with some friends for dinner one night. Everything went pretty smoothly service wise besides the waitress forgot about my friend's cocktail, but she didn't charge her for it, which was thoughtful. We got the devils on horseback, jalapeno corn bread (forgot exactly what it was called), and the baked oysters for appetizers. The devils on horseback were good, but the portion was very small, and it was a bit too oily. The jalapeno corn bread was good, but I think it was lacking more jalapeno/spicy flavor. It mostly tasted like corn bread to me. And then the baked oysters nawlins style were super small and not very worth it. I don't think I'd get those again, but I'd want to try the raw oysters here some other time.My friends got the pub burger and arctic char while I got the hanger steak. The pub burger was pretty good, and the arctic char was decent too, but for the price, I don't know if the char was worth it. The hangar steak was good, but the kimchi fried rice/sauce was really REALLY salty. I had to move most of it away from the steak because I almost couldn't eat it. We didn't get any dessert since we were full, but I'll probably take a look at that next time. Nothing was bad, but nothing especially impressed me either after hearing the hype about this place. I would go back to try some other entrees though. The fried chicken looks tempting! Maybe even for brunch some time too!",Holly C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,3/25/13,"I'm only ever eating at Cameron Mitchell restaurants from now on, always. We went on a Saturday afternoon for some drinks and oysters. We ended up ordering an actual meal because the apps were so good we felt like we had to try the entrees! They do a special brunch menu on weekends. Service: Never better. Our waiter was super sweet and really attentive. They make absolutely everything from scratch, he said, except the Heinz ketchup! The staff seem really proud of the restaurant and how special it is, and that is a really nice attitude to have and it makes the customers feel like their experience really is special and unique, like they've been let in on a fabulous secret. Drinks: Vodka tonic is the best I've ever had in my whole life, and I have these everywhere I go and on every continent I've been to. They make their own tonic water and its heavenly. It has kind of a sweet taste, so beware: its still strong! careful! Bloody Mary really was ""the best in town"". Actually I think its the best in several towns. I loved that it was kind of rustic (served in a mason jar), and the tomato juice (home-made) had a bit of pulp in it, which I loved. Perfect flavor and seasoning, and it was strong too! Food:Get oysters. We had the Nola style oysters which comes in a divine buttery sauce, so good we almost licked it off the plate.Delicious ""Pub burger"", cooked well (true medium), and bun was the best kind of bun.  The meat was also buttery and melt-in-your-mouth!  The cambozola cheese makes it taste a bit more fancy than the average pub burger. The HOMEMADE TOMATO JAM was so good. Also, the waiter was really accommodating. I casually mentioned we would share, and he had the kitchen cut the burger in half, and bring us separate plates with our own fries. It was such a nice touch, love the close attention to detail this place really has with everything.Also its worth the price. It is actually surprisingly inexpensive for the quality of food, drink, and service.",Jackie S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,8/16/14,"Went with a few friends for dinner on Friday night--not sure what the wait time would have been if we hadn't made a reservation earlier in the week as it looked pretty full. Overall, the ambiance was nice, but a little dark. Our booth/table was comfortable and it seemed like they were able to accommodate a few large groups in the section next to ours. We all ordered Moscow Mules, which were delicious. They muddle their own ginger, and you can definitely taste the difference. At $10 each, they were a little pricey but not expensive enough to keep us from ordering a second round. :) As a recent New Orleans transplant, I was excited to see baked oysters on the menu! There were only three in an order, but the broth was great, oysters were a little salty. I ordered the Pub Burger, which was excellent. The gf went with the fish and chips, which was good but normal. We split a piece of brown sugar pie for dessert, which was really freaking awesome. Extra points for fresh whipped cream. Our waiter was friendly, and clearly knowledgable about the menu. Why only four stars? -It was kind of noisy-For the price of the entrees ($15-30), I was surprised that we didn't get bread or some other pre-entree snacky. -Menu was pretty limited (maybe 8 entrees?). Things seemed consistently high quality, but were pretty specific. For example, the only pasta dish was ramen with a pork loin. No other seafood pasta options. I'd go back, but might try other places first.",Jess R.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,3/30/16,"The atmosphere is fun, and the good is wonderful!! Get the beet salad, seriously. I have never liked beets AT. ALL. and I actually crave this salad. I had a great bloody mary there, and have never had a bad entree. Plan ahead for parking...sometimes you have to walk a bit, but it's a nice walk..",K R.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,7/21/14,"The Pearl, in my opinion, is a restaurant for hipsters. If you like to go to a popular but overcrowded restaurant and overpay for overrated food while drinking out of a mason jar, this is your restaurant. We dined here this past Saturday (7/19/14) for the second time. The first time (I think around December 2013), we were underwhelmed. But we love Cameron Mitchell restaurants, so we had to give them a second try. Unfortunately, our second visit was even worse. Having been to every Cameron Mitchell restaurant in Columbus, I will not hesitate to say that the Pearl is easily his worst restaurant. Now let me be clear-- The Pearl isn't bad, per se. It's just nowhere near as good as everyone else on Yelp claims it to be. The food/service at the Pearl certainly doesn't justify the price premium that they charge. And all the other Cameron Mitchell restaurants are just better in all aspects. The restaurant itself is very, very crowded and very cramped. I suppose you might expect that from a restaurant in the Short North. The amount of space you get here is similar to Marcella's, even though you're paying like you're at Martini. Perhaps due to the crowd, the service here is hands down the worst out of all the Cameron Mitchell restaurants in town. We made a reservation with OpenTable and arrived 5 minutes early. When we tried to check in, the host muttered under his breath to the girl next to him, ""I just gave away their table..."" Thanks man. 15 minutes later and after being skipped by 3 other parties whose reserved tables the host apparently didn't give away, we were seated.The beer list here is pretty good, with 8 craft beers on draft with many, many more bottles available. Our waiter wasn't very knowledgeable about beers though, so we didn't have much help in that department. The dishes on the menu here seems to be a mishmash of Cap City Diner and the Columbus Fish Market (which I realize is no longer owned by Cameron Mitchell). The food here is good... but not great. Nothing to rave about. Cap City has better food and is less expensive. Not to mention the fact that the dishes at Cap City are 50% bigger than similar dishes at the Pearl.For appetizer, we got their jalapeno corn bread and three orders of oysters. (1 order = 3 oysters) The corn bread was good, but I don't think I would've known it had jalapenos in it, had I not read it on the menu. The oysters were good as well, but way overpriced. We paid $24 and only got 9 pieces. Ouch. In comparison, you can get a dozen oysters at the Columbus Fish Market for $26.58. It also didn't help that our waiter was clueless about oysters. We had the option of Maine, Massachusetts, PEI, British Columbia, or Virginia Oysters. He stated that with the exception of the Massachusetts ones, they were all about the same size-- so we got 3 from Maine, 3 from PEI, and 3 from British Columbia. Turns out the Maine oysters are 2.5 times the size of the PEI/BC oysters and less fishy. Come on dude.Our waiter apparently forgot that we'd only ordered appetizers at this point, so after we had already finished our oysters and corn bread, we had to flag him down to remind him that we still need to order our main course. (This is now around 45 minutes into our meal.) For our main course, our party of 4 ordered fish & chips, cuban sandwich, shrimp & grits, and the pork trio.My father had the pork trio, and was very happy with it. I had this dish myself when I dined here the first time, and this is a good dish.My mother had the shrimp & grits, but she said it was too salty and left half her plate uneaten. My mother is a lifelong member of the clean plates club, so this was unusual.My wife had the fish & chips, which was good, but painfully overpriced. The dish cost $17.99 and came with three chicken tender sized strips of fish, french fries, and coleslaw. The Sam Adams beer battered fish & chips @ Columbus Fish Market is better, bigger, and cheaper at $16.99. I got the Cuban sandwich, which was ok. The flavor was good, and the side of black bean soup was also good. But at $14 for a sandwich that was maybe a little bit bigger than a Subway 6"" sub... not sure if it's worth it. In summary:-If you want an oyster bar, go to the Columbus Fish Market.-If you want a good gastropub, go to 101 Beer Kitchen, Matt the Millers, or Hudson 29. -If you want to go to a Cameron Mitchell restaurant with a similar menu (minus the oysters), go to Cap City.-If you absolutely must go to a Cameron Mitchell restaurant in the short north, go to Marcellas or Martini.I'm glad that I've dined at The Pearl, so I can say that I've been here, but I have no urge whatsoever to dine here again.",Kaoru M.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,4,2010/8/15,"Why was my first visit to The Pearl in September 2015?! This place has some delicious oysters and a pretty legit happy hour. Not to mention, the service is pretty great, too! Their baked oysters are my favorite. My friends ordered the raw and fried oysters and enjoyed those just as much as I did the baked ones. To go along with my pre-meal, I had a Moscow Mule. It was pretty good. For my main course, I ordered the Pub Burger. It's a simple burger with cambozola cheese and tomato jam on it paired with tavern fries. It's also 1/2 price during happy hour. I had a delicious meal and drink for under $20. Can't beat that. Also, Gabby, our server, was extremely helpful. It was a great experience!",Ty W.,,,,,,

The place was crowded but we don't typically mind sitting at the bar when we don't have reservations.  I had the clam chowder & it was great.  I also had the fried chicken and it was good.  Large portion with a cinnamon roll so that made it better.  My wife had the baked clams & she raved about them with the crusty bread.  She also had the salmon which she said was good, not amazing.

Their burger is pretty good, but there are much better options on the menu (e.g. raw bar).  Their cocktails are consistently good, though nothing I'd recommend as a must try. The staff has always been very friendly, though they can sometimes get bogged down and can be slow to get stuff out.

The Pearl,578,4,5,9/14/14,This was my first time here. We went for Sunday brunch and was pleasantly surprised. I loved the decoration. The bar was spacious. We made reservations so there was no wait time. We were seated at our table and went over the menu. Our waiter Nick was so attentive and professional. I first ordered the deviled eggs. I asked if they tasted homemade like my mom's and he said everyone asks that question. I didn't believe him but they came out as a cute presentation. Let me just say if I could order them in bulk for Thanksgiving I would. They were sooooooooo good. I then ordered the pancakes and bacon. Wow is all I can say. I'm so glad we decided to come here. I'm not from here but when I come back it will be my first stop.,Ro C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,1/28/14,"Went here last weekend and despite a horrible parking situation this place lived up to all my expectations. The jalapeÌ±o spoon bread is fantastic. The N'awlins baked oysters are even better. But perhaps the best thing we had were the short ribs. We couldn't have ended the night any better trying the brown sugar ""crack"" pie and Dutch Apple pieWould definitely go back again and again.",Ashwin L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,3/13/15,"If you are looking for a place to enjoy Sunday morning brunch, look no further than The Pearl.As I was reading the menu, I instantly saw several dishes I wanted to try, but opted for the chicken and waffles. I also ordered the house smoked salmon as an appetizer.  Once the salmon arrived at my table, I could not wait a moment longer to try it and was incredibly pleased with the dish. The ratio between the salmon and scallion tartar sauce was perfect, and the deviled egg was a delightful touch. The chicken and waffles dish was also delicious, especially with the warm blueberry sauce, which set it aside from other chicken and waffle dishes I have had in the past.  The ambiance of the restaurant is classy, yet cozy and intimate with its fine decor, low lighting, and lit candles.  Something I found particularly interesting and fun is how the check is given using an old book, rather than the typical check presenter found at other restaurants.",Mariel C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,8/16/14,"I went for restaurant week and it was delicious. I had honestly heard mixed things about it, but I wanted to give it a try.  Reservations were made, but we were not able to be seated right away.  We waited probably an additional ten minutes after our reservation time-- no worries. You have preset options with restaurant week, which makes things easier.  I had the jalapeno spoon bread.  It's served in a skillet with butter and honey.  It was absolutely delicious and very filling.  I'm from the south and it reminded me of home...so very good. For dinner, I chose the braised short rib. It was delicious. I loved the flavors, the presentation.  The sauce accompanying the short rib was amazing.  It all went so well with the whipped mashed potatoes on the bottom of the plate. I also liked the vegetables as well.  This is likely the best meal I have had in Columbus in a very long time.I was already full, but it was time for some pie.  My friend chose a pie that was literally like brown sugar on a pie crust.  It was over the top sweet, but so so good.  The piece was smaller, but after a couple bites it became too much sweet.  I ordered the blackberry pie. It came to the table very warm in a skilled.  Think of it essentially as a mini pie.  It was great and not over the top sweet, just right.  I ate and ate and ate.  Needless to say I walked away very happy and ready to hibernate for the winter.",H H.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,4,8/19/14,"This review is based solely off their brunch. We decided to try the pearls brunch last weekend for the first time. Started the day off with Bloody Mary's. the person I was with is a Bloody Mary snob and she raved over her drink. The house made tomato juice was delicious. When it came time to order I was torn between the waffle and chicken and the buttermilk pancakes. Our server talked me into the huevos rancheros which I wasn't even thinking about. It was a great pick. My lady got the Tavern Benny which is their take on biscuits and gravy. It was also amazing. Since I had a hard time deciding our server Nick brought out a small pancake and piece of bacon so I got the best of both worlds. It was a very nice gesture. The house made syrup is very tasty. Be prepared to spend a good amount of time at the pearl. No one seems to be in a hurry. Which was fine with me because we at Sunday brunch relaxing.

The Pearl,578,4,4,2001/9/15,"Went here for a late lunch/early dinner on NYE. The food was great, the service was great, and the dessert was great. In fact, it's the first Cameron Mitchell restaurant I actually enjoyed and would recommend for others.We ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, parmesan baked clams, and raw oysters for our appetizers. They were all great. For the entree I ordered the scallops which were on special and my husband ordered the fish and chips. He said the fish & chips were delicious and not greasy and my scallops were great. We ordered chocolate mousse for dessert along with a scoop of ice cream which was from Jeni's. It was very rich mousse, but delicious.The overall entree menu was pretty typical and nothing too special, but I would definitely go back again for their daily fish special and appetizer options.",Ariana E.,,,,,,

My date and I had the Devils on Horseback (bacon stuffed dates), which were the highlight of the meal. Not far behind was the Jalapeno Corn Spoon Bread, which was basically like jalapeno spiced cornbread. Man, that was so creamy and the butter/honey concoction on the side was the perfect complement. I almost forgot the House Smoked Salmon, which came with this delicious Scallion Tartar Sauce. Surprisingly, one of the best peices of salmon I've eaten.Also, had Bloody Mary's that had the perfect amount of kick to it. Flavor was terrific, and I even got a Miller High Life on the side!Great date spot, ambience is relaxed, but nice enough that she'll be impressed.

The Pearl,578,4,3,6/28/14,"Not a bad option if you have reservations or don't mind a long wait.

The Pearl,578,4,5,5/28/14,"Before I say anything else, this place is amazing. That should be your key takeaway. We rolled into Columbus on our way back from New Jersey to Iowa and wanted to have dinner at a nice place. Glad we made a reservation - even on a Wednesday night, the place was packed. While we waited for our table, we decided to order drinks. The pearl oyster stout for me, and a Templeton rye martini for the boyfriend. The bartender asked about his preference for bitters. She then pointed to a rotating shelf of various bottles and recommended a few different kinds. He went with chocolate bitters and they were amazing. Our server was very friendly once we were seated. Our second round of drinks included the Siberian Night stout and the Dragon's Milk Bourbon Barrel stout (at 22oz and 10% ABV it was enough for us to split reasonably).  Without hesitation - and fully trusting other reviews - we started with the jalapeÌ±o corn spoon bread. IT WAS AMAZING. YOU MUST ORDER IT. THAT IS ALL. It ended up coming out right before our entrees so we had a lot of food on our table at once (I didn't see a problem with this). The waiter immediately came over, apologized profusely because we hadn't really gotten to enjoy the spoon bread, and offered to take our entrees back to the kitchen for a bit. We declined, and he said he'd certainly comp the spoon bread for the trouble. Unexpected, but definitely wow-factor service. I thoroughly enjoyed the grilled cheese and can safely say it was the best cheese sandwich I have ever tasted. The sweetness of the pear jam and roasted squash perfectly balanced the kick of the arugula pesto and the saltiness of the Brie. I will dream about this sandwich for weeks - no joke. Boyfriend ordered the catch of the day. It was a cod filet served with clams and mussels over jasmine rice and some vegetables. He says it was perfect. The cod was cooked beautifully and was smooth and flavorful; the broth was well-seasoned; the vegetables were crisp, and the clams were done well. When describing it, he trailed off to say simply: It was yummy. The menu said fresh pie daily - save room, so obviously we had to do that. The pie of the day was a brown sugar and butter concoction. We couldn't just get one slice so I ordered apple pie a la mode. It was perfect. Great meal, great service, great ambiance. 5 stars all around.",Holly D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,11/28/14,Moscow mule drink is amazing! Short ribs were to die for!! Mashed potatoes have a hint of horseradish which sets this dish off! Also the hanger steak is delicious!!

The Pearl,578,4,5,9/23/14,"Finally tried this Columbus staple.  The beet salad, grilled cheese, and brown sugar pie were simply amazing.  I could have the meal every day.  The fish and chips and shrimp and grits were also good but I just enjoyed the other items more.  They also serve an excellent Moscow mule.  The classy ambience and attentive service make dining at the Pearl a luxurious experience.",Sharmeela S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2004/6/15,"Not a bad little spot, but there is definite room for improvement. A few coworkers and I visited with clients while we were in town on business. We made a reservation for 7 people. When we arrived, we were seated at two rather small tables that were pushed together. To make matters worse, the setting was in a crammed corner, making it difficult to get in and out of backside of the table. The food made up for the questionable seating. The starters and snacks were a great start. The cheese curds were perfectly crisped and the goat cheese/corn bread bake was irresistible. I had the short rib entree and it melted in my mouth as any good short rib should. The drink menu was nice but could have used more cocktails. I would have expected more whisky drinks from a restaurant with such a laid back, craft motif. Being from the Midwest, I ordered a Moscow Mule and was pretty disappointed to receive a watered down imitation. On the service side, The Pearl fared pretty well. All of our food came out in a reasonable amount of time and our server knew the menu well. My only complaints would be the cleaning of the table between courses. There were empty plates and glasses lingering even after new items were brought out. Overall, a nice place. The vibe is great and made me feel relaxed and ready for a nice meal. The sugar pie was a perfect and tasty end to the experience. Keep up the good work.",Trey W.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,2/20/16,"2 stars because they attempted to and did take care of my issue. We had a pretty good wait once we placed our order for brunch which was fine because we sipped and enjoyed our mid morning cocktails. When the food finally arrived it looked fantastic. Smelled fantastic. The presentation- nailed it. The bad thing; the sausage with my order was served raw. It was simply nasty. After several minutes of moving the food around on my plate I lost my appetite. Got up and went to the restroom. The server did replace it with a new order but it was to late. Good chance I will not be back. How hard is it to cook sausage? ""The chef sends his apologizes""? Maybe the chef should go to Waffle House or McDonalds and re-learn how to prepare sausage. I would recommend trying out many of the other places in the short north serving brunch over the Pearl.",Chris L.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,2,2006/4/16,"I had the same experience Rosalie W. had. Seems to be their tactic. I came in at 10pm, they close at 11. It was raining, so it wasn't as crowded as usual. I ordered a glass of pinot from Oregon based on the waitresses recommendation that was pretty good. I ordered baked clams and raw oysters for starters. The clams came out a bit before my meal. They had a metallic flavor, so, I wouldn't order them. At this time, one employee was obviously trying to go home, so he was sweeping right at our table. I told him to finish later cause I don't like dust getting all over my food and a broom hitting my feet while I'm eating dinner. Then our main course came out. Both main courses were good. Then the waitress brought the oysters out and apologized they were late and said they would be on the house, only when she brought the bill out, they were still on there. Exactly the same spiel and act that Rosalie W. received. Great way to ruin a nice evening.",Daniel S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,10/23/14,"A great standard for bringing out of towners (and just a good standard in general). To start, get some deviled eggs. They're served in a fun way. Also, the jalapeÌ±o spoon bread is ridiculous, as are the chicken wing confit. Their oyster selection has never disappointed, but their seafood tower is lacking for the price. For mains, I've loved the hanger steak, fried chicken, and Arctic char. The burger is great, but if you're not a lover of pungent cheese, ask to swap it with something different. Their drinks are great, and if you're there with a couple people, you should try one of the punch bowls.Overall a good place for dinner or brunch.",Jon B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2011/12/15,"Since moving to Columbus The Pearl has quickly become my favorite restaurant. When we host guests from out of town we love showing them our new dinner spot and are never disappointed with the ambiance, wine list, food selections & dessert. We have been here a few times and tried almost everything on the menu. My favorites include: Devils on horsebackOysters - take their recommendations of the day Short Ribs Hangar Steak Park ChopBrown Sugar PieThe Brown Sugar Pie is one of the most incredible desserts I have ever tasted. It is wonderful.  I dream about it. Often. Too often that it is slightly weird. Anyways. This is a great restaurant. I recommend dinner here as brunch is not the best showing of the menu/staff capabilities.",Jessica S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,6/30/16,I love the oyster night here! They have oysters from different areas and $1.5 /oyster is a pretty good deal.,Sam L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,10/14/15,"I live super close so my friends and I decided to try The Pearl for Sunday brunch and couldn't have been more disappointed.  I'm fairly new to Columbus and moved here after living in two huge brunching cities - Portland, OR and DC.  This was a let down for what I'm used to.  The food was subpar and the service was worse. Our $9 brunch cocktails sat empty for 15-20 minutes at a time and the server seemed like he had better things to do than explain the menu or actually service the table.  I've heard good things about this place so maybe it was just an off day but I don't know that I'd give it another try with so many other options in the short north.",Ren P.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,1/13/16,"Everyone raves about The Pearl and I understand why -- it's a cute spot and a decent menu. They lost a couple stars from me by not being very vegetarian friendly and being a little pushy with the timing on the bill. I thought the Char Cauliflower and it's description sounded like a veggie dish and was so glad that I asked them to elaborate because it's actually a fish, despite not indicating that in any way on the menu. Good cocktails! Also try the jalapeÌ±o corn bread.",Valerie T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2001/11/15,"Pearl never disappoints! When time permits, I make sure I get here on Sunday's for Brunch. If you're a local, you know what I mean but out of towners.....this is a must before you head home.I highly recommend the 'Devils on Horseback' to get your meal started...(the fresh OJ is top notch...with vodka of course). Keep up the great work!",Jared B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2001/10/15,"Classy little joint with a very cool interior complete with a raw bar. We had a late lunch with friends and just about tried everything on the menu. Favorite appetizers were the jalapeÌ±o cornbread & Devils on horseback. Oysters were delicious, but pricey. Large selection from east and west coast as well. The cheeseburger was out of site and the Cuban was a big hit.",Buckhead C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,10/18/15,Delicious! Everything from the coffee to the food was perfect. I got the stuff french toast and my boyfriend got the chicken and waffles... and then finished my food.

The Pearl,578,4,5,2005/3/14,"We've been dying to try The Pearl for awhile now but have been too busy to schedule a night out on the town. So when my birthday rolled around, we made reservations for a Saturday night.It was a gorgeous day, so they had the front windows open which was awesome. The restaurant is beautiful inside and every employee I dealt with were incredibly kind. We were seated at one of the tables by the bar, which is the placement that usually irritates me but here it was a nice perch to people watch and plate watch... there were so fabulous looking dishes passing by. The cocktails. We both opted for cocktails on this night, I picked the Moscow Mule which was awesome... probably one of the best ones I've had. The fiance had a scofflaw and, even though I don't like bourbon, I would order one of these... damn tasty.Okay, the food. I listened to the majority of Yelpers and ordered the spoon bread. I am so glad that I did. Holy crap, it was good! I've had traditional Southern spoon bread and this was as close to a Southern Grandmother making a pan for you as you'll find here. It was even good as leftovers the next morning. For dinner, I ordered the Gulf shrimp boil. It was simple perfection. A dozen perfectly cooked, peel'n'eat shrimp. The fiance had the shrimp and grits which he fell in love with immediately. We were both thrilled that we came here. I don't think we'll wait for a special occasion  next time. Hmmm... maybe brunch tomorrow?",Stephanie P.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2001/2/16,"The Pearl is a my favorite date night spot for my husband and I. I love the decor, the dress of the staff, and the food is amazing. I would definitely recommend trying the deviled eggs and jalapeno corn bread.",Lisa S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2010/12/14,"We're here on business and was told to try Pearls, so I make a reservation and when we arrived we were seated right away. Ordered a martini which had come half full in a glass that looks like a small margarita glass. We told the manager Lori ( which I have to say is wonderful) she right away brought us 2 new ones fill to the top. We ordered the corn bread, dates wrapped in bacon and fries all were very good. For dinner we got the hanger steak, artic char, both very good the other meal was the steak, it came out not the way my colleague like it so I can't really say but they were nice enough to take it off the bill and get us the wonderful desert, Brown Sugar Pie. They treated us great and would definitely return, when we come back. Thanks Lori, we left laughing and happy.",Paul B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,5/28/16,"Wonderful oysters!!!! If u order a dozen, they r gonna give you various kinds from different places ... Oysters r super fresh an wine is perfect! I luv this place !!!!

The Pearl,578,4,3,4/28/14,"Had dinner here earlier tonight, and below are some thoughts.Food - Was very good, but at the price it needs to be more memorable.  We had the pork trio, fried chicken, deviled eggs, and the bacon wrapped date appetizer.  Pass on the eggs, fun presentation but nothing special.Atmosphere - Beautiful with an attention to detail that goes a touch too far.  My dinning companion, while agreeing the place was beautiful thought it reminded a bit too much of having dinner in a Restoration Hardware store.Service - Excellent, simply excellent.  Our server was there when needed, without seeming to hover.  She was much more memorable than the food.If you are up for the oysters and such The Pearl may rate higher than 3 stars for you, but for my party it just wasn't somewhere we'd make a point to return.",James D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2004/4/14,"I came here with my buddy Alex who lives in Columbus. We ordered a few dozen oysters from Nantucket, Chesapeake Bay, and Blue Point, Long Island. I was amazed at the range of oysters offered, the waitresses knowledge of the oysters, and the ambiance. I was truly impressed.Located downtown, not far from OSU, this is a perfect spot for drinks and oysters. The staff is very nice and ambiance is perfect. The first warm night of April with weather in the mid 70s. The windows were open to the street and the scene was lovely.",Greg O.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2006/12/15,"Love their style, the atmosphere, the good vibage, and most importantly; their exquisite twist on awesome dishes- a foodies land mine. Good service, great work ethic. Definitely a returning customer.",Anne D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2005/9/15,"This is by far my favorite of the Mitchell restaurants I have tried. Parking is tricky. I tried the spoon bread, tater tots, fish and chips (perch), fried chicken, and oysters. All were delicious (and some of the best I've ever had). Price was appropriate. Atmosphere was trendy and upscale with an overall nice vibe. Service was solid. I'd certainly return and recommend it to my friends! Try anything you like and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",Zack O.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,10/16/15,"Crowded and overpriced. Food was mediocre at best, and mason jars for water and books to hold the bills were gimmicky, not charming. Disappointing - you can do a lot better than this in town.",Steve M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,1/20/15,"The Pearl is one of my favorite Columbus restaurants due to its top notch dishes and friendly wait staff. I have been here twice and the wait staff is always the bright spot; very friendly and extremely attentive. Food has always came out very quickly.I have tried a number of dishes here and they are all outstanding. Very flavorful dishes coupled with a great presentation. Some of the portions from the oyster bar are small so just know that if you go that route. One gripe I have is the change in the cheese curd appetizer between my two most recent visits. First time they were amazing!!!! However this most recent time i got them there was barely any cheese at all some of the ""curds"" was just hollow breading. Oh and the cocktails are out of this world. One of the best Manhattans I have had in Columbus and my GF loves the Moscow Mule here.Overall this is a great place to entertain clients, have a few drinks, or take a date!",Joe F.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,11/20/15,"Really loved this place. Just had my first visit to Columbus and this restaurant was a pleasant surprise. The bartenders know what they are doing and the service was amazing. Our waitress, Eva, was attentive, easy to work with, and fun to talk to. The food was very impressive and you will not regret getting dessert.",Michael C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,2011/12/15,"First time at the Pearl and it was very disappointing. There was only one bartender, and she was so busy it took us over 15 minutes to get a drink order in. The oysters came fairly quickly and were good. We had completely forgotten we ordered meatballs because they took so long to arrive. The bartender then forgot to ring in our second order of drinks, so we went somewhere else. If the service is this bad on a Wednesday, I cant imagine it on the weekend. I don't blame the bartender, it's not her fault she had no help. Probably won't go back.",Liz D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2002/2/14,"GREAT customer service!!!  My husband and I came out for our first date after a new addition to our family.  ;-)  With the little guy at home with the grandparents, we went out for brunch, determined to have a good time.  Some of you know I have a nut allergy and I let the server know - wouldn't you know, the very dish I wanted (chicken and waffles) was made with peanut oil.  Now, supposedly peanut oil doesn't have the proteins that most people are allergic to, but with previous near death experiences I wasn't taking a chance.  But I REALLY wanted the chicken and waffles.  Without even asking, the server informed me that they could cook it at nearby Marcella's without the peanut oil, but since it was brunch time, I'd have to wait 40 minutes.  We decided to get drinks and starters (spoonbread and oysters) and wait.  My husband got the poutine.  Thirty minutes later, I had my chicken and waffles, and he had his poutine.  And it was glorious.  SO worth it.  And I really DO appreciate the extra effort they went through to make my dish.  The spoonbread was good, and the oysters excellent.  My husband said the poutine was a little on the salty side, but good.  And the mimosas were excellent - I don't like mine too sweet, and these were wonderfully tart.It was a wonderful first date out.  :-)  Thanks, the Pearl!",Cherie R.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2002/10/14,"We went to the Pearl for Happy Hour- Drink Specials were great, the food was good-ok. We had; salmon-good portion size nice flavorchicken wings-unique good flavorOysters-just ok. Very small and I'm not sure if that's just the season or if they use the smaller one's for HH. Still, good flavor, The tiny little guys were swimming in a butter sauce that was to die for.Deviled eggs-don't waste your money-nothing special, at all.Cuban sandwich-this left much to be desiredCorn Bread-delicious but tasted like jiffyOverall-great atmosphere, great HH, but I doubt if I'd go for dinner.",Angela G.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,7/30/15,"If this was closer to my house, I would be a regular. The cornbread is probably the best I've had (outside my home, of course) and every menu item I have tried (especially the shrimp and grits) has been phenomenal. Great service, very attentive.",Ms. B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2/24/14,"I'll start with the good:Fantastic drinks! Modern atmosphere! Cute and friendly service!Hands down best Bloody Mary!! (Minus the pepperoni garnish- a heads up would be nice) I'm vegetarian and did not think to request a ""vegetarian"" Bloody Mary.Great Moscow mule. Great spicy corn bread.The servers I have had there are very attentive and knowledgeable. I love love the atmosphere and the staff attire. The best and now ties are so hip and classy. I love the old-timey vibe. And, once again amazing drinks. It seems like all the pretty people in Columbus gather here. Good times!The Bad:I took one star away for the ricotta balls. They were bland. Also, they need more good vegetarian options. What about an acorn squash filled with a couscous com concoction of sautÌ©ed spinach and garlic mash?? Something satisfying like that. Also, some more options that aren't as heavy would balance out the menu. The Ugly:Another star away because I am a vegetarian and only have 1 option there. A  mediocre salad that is 20$ really doesn't do it for me.Anyway, if you like oysters, drinks and seafood....its a good place. I don't like seafood -so its not for me. The menu needs to be more diversified. Love getting a drink here though, sans pig meat! Haha",Mandy M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2012/12/13,"One of the best meals of my life. Cocktails and appetizers were fantastic, but really was impressed by the wings. I grew up working in my aunt and uncle's restaurant and to this day, the wings at The Pearl are the only close to as good as the friend chicken we made there. Whatever process they go through is magical. For my entrÌ©e, I chose the short rib. Please, for the love of your taste buds, do this. They gave me a knife, but it was pointless as the short rib was so tender and moist (who doesn't love ""moist"" things?) that it nearly fell apart as my fork touched the meat. Our server was unreal good and - as my wife and I were on a date - gave us a wonderful evening with the appropriate chattiness and also allowing us to spend time alone enjoying each other's company. It was a treat that I'll be remembering for some time.",Adam L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,5/19/14,"I finally got around to trying the Pearl for the first time on Sunday. I know, I know that is probably way too long to have waited, but c'est la vie I suppose. It was worth the visit though as I found the experience enjoyable.I ended up having a pint of the Pearl Oyster Stout as my opener. I had tried the beer once before as it's brewed just a ways down the street at North High Brewing. I believe it's a beer that they make specifically for this restaurant. Along with the beer I decided to order the Pub Burger. The Cambozola cheese topping went exceptionally well with the tomato jam topping that came on the side. The fries that come as the side dish are incredibly delicious and are served in a portion that you will simply be unable to finish (especially since the burger is rather generously sized as well).I left with my appetite sated and my tasted buds in delight. I'm told that there is also a rather lovely brunch here that I'll have to return to try on another occasion.",Ryan K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,5/15/15,Great atmosphere! Went here with a work group sound level was not overwhelming. Menu selection was good for the entire group from Vegan to Carnavor. I had the Hanger Steak with Kimshee Rice I ordered Medium Rare and I felt it was a little to on the rare side but there was not a bite left on my plate. The interior was trendy and hip. The staff were all very friednly. The only negative was I ordered a drink and the glass had a crack in it and instead of replacing my drink they poured the drink from the glass with the crack into the new glass. If that had not happened I would have given 5 stars. I would recommend and revisit this location again when in the area.,Geoff R.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,2011/4/15,"My sister who attends OSU and my coworkers only had amazing things to say, but we left our meal incredibly disappointed. The service was bad - we saw our server maybe once before she shoved our check across the table, never asking if we'd like another drink or if the food was any good. And the food - another disappointment. My sister ordered the ricotta dumplings which tasted like they'd been reheated 4 times (she'd had them before and loved them). I had the short rib which was better than the dumplings, but still underwhelming. I came in with high expectations, but won't be returning any time soon.",Kadie C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2006/4/15,"I like this place, I really do.  It has a whole lot of hype around it and it's constantly packed full with hipsters, but it's ok.

It's clear that they put a lot of thought into their menu development, and the bartenders mix some mean cocktails.",Mackenzie F.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,3,2005/11/15,"I've been wanting to check out The Pearl since I moved to Columbus almost 2 years ago and finally made my way there yesterday for brunch. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. I'd heard so many great things about this place and at the end of brunch I was underwhelmed. The restaurant itself was pretty cool: the decor was cute, the space was used well, and I liked the open kitchen area. However, the food and service was subpar. Our server greeted us but did not offer up the specials and/or mention the omelette of the day. Our drinks were empty and we had to track him down to order another. And finally, the food was nothing to write home about. My meal, the huevos rancheros was bland. The tortillas came on the side and were brought out wrapped in foil but they stuck together making it impossible to roll them up in a more traditional huevos rancheros style. My dining companion ordered the chicken and waffles per our server's suggestion, yet her waffle was overlooked and stayed rock hard even when she added a ton of maple syrup. Maybe brunch just isn't their strong suit, but since I'm not a fan of oysters, I will likely not return.",Holly Jo J.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,3,7/13/15,Every time I go here I think the staff is very nice and attentive but the food is mediocre and tiny for a huge price.  I am a small person and don't eat very much so for me to think the portions are small is a big deal.  The food is not bad but so not worth the huge bill attached to it.  There are too many better deals with amazing food in the Short North to keep going here.,Naomi M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,1/19/14,"Took a friend from out of town here because 1. We both wanted good seafood. 2. I hadn't had oysters since I lived in Charleston, SC (over two years). So we chose Pearl and it was amazing. I called early afternoon the day of to see if I could by chance get a reservation, but they were booked. The lady on the phone was very nice and told us to just come and they usually can fit walk-ins in or we can eat at the bar. Once we got there, the guy at the entrance didn't seem to want to help because he said they don't seat walk ins so we would need to wait for a bar seat or sit at the raw bar. So, it was slightly confusing based on the conversation I had on the phone prior. We weren't In a Hurry but the stars aligned and we only waited for about 10 minutes and got a bar seat. Both bartenders were very helpful in answering any questions we had, but also very friendly as well. We order edit he dates wrapped in bacon and they were fantastic, we both could have eaten a pound of them!I ordered two orders of the Baked Oysters (1 order only has 3 oysters). They were baked with a spicy seasoning. I absolutely loved them. My friend ordered the baked clams and those were just as great. Be sure to also try the Moscow mule, it's their most popular drink and is refreshing and delicious!I love the atmosphere and the feel of the place, it's relaxed but not too relaxed. Don't feel like you can't wear jeans there based from pricing... Which is the only downfall. I paid $22.00 for 6 oysters. I knew they would be good so It didn't hurt too much, but as all of you who eat oysters, 6 doesn't cut it. After my six oysters, a glass of wine, Moscow mule, and a split price of the dates... I spent $50.00 on myself. So, I took myself out on a date, haha. I will return, but probably only for special occasions! All in all it was a wonderful experience!",Kathryn W.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,5/20/14,"Fantastic cocktails and some cool menu items like bacon wrapped dates that are to die for. I've been stuck on the Moscow Mules the last few times and have had several friends have the Bloody Mary's which they've said are one of the best in the city.

The Pearl,578,4,4,4/22/15,"Tried The Pearl out a few weeks ago for a Sunday brunch. First of all, I loved the dÌ©cor and ambiance of the place. Very cozy and comfortable. Tables are a bit close together, but that really didn't bother me. Had the devils on horseback for a starter. They were very tasty, but I think a bit overpriced for such a small portion. I believe there were only 4 of them. And not very big. But, still tasted great. I decided on the Tavern Benny and my bfriend got the Chicken and Waffles. Great portion sizes and everything tasted delicious. Only complaint was that my food was not piping hot. It was warm. Would have been better if hotter!

We have been here on several occasions both for dinner and brunch, and have left every time feeling euphoric over our dining experience.The last time we went to the Pearl, I made reservations through OpenTable and asked them to have a bottle of champagne chilled and waiting at our table since it was my best friend & fiance's 30th birthdays.  Everything was perfect, and they were so surprised when we walked in!  Their deviled eggs are some of the best we have ever had, as well as the devils on horseback.From their drink menu to the atmosphere to the service, the Pearl is a great place to go for any special occasion (even if that means a regular Tuesday night!)",Nicole O.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,2001/10/15,"It was okay... Just okay. Went for happy hour. Oysters had some shells in them, they brought us less oysters than we ordered, forgot some of our small plates and we really had to stay on top of them for it. The smoked salmon was okay but not flavorful and was basically a giant non delicate chunk of fish, with toasted wonder bread. Chicken wing confit, literally just chicken wings. JalapeÌ±o skillet corn bread was pretty good. Nothing was outright bad, and nothing was surprisingly good. The server was okay taking things off our bill that never showed up... But still not good that we had that much trouble just to get what we ordered. If friends were going Id go again rather than miss out, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way for this place.",Jessica P.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,3,2011/6/13,"I was very excited to learn yesterday, that we would be dining at The Pearl for dinner. This has been one of my top places to visit in Columbus and for it to be a surprise was just wonderful!We arrived, handed our keys to the valet and headed inside. The decor is beautiful and the floor is SLIPPERY. Please be careful* It was quite loud, but that may have just been the party of people I was with. I wish I could apologize to the table beside us, for the type of things said at our table last night *oh the embarrassment*.Anyways- We sat down and ordered the oysters. We did the flight of oysters, that I don't even think was on the menu. It was four dozen oysters, two of the Chesapeake oysters, one each of two different types that I can no longer remember. The oysters were raw, so sliminess is to be expected. What I didn't expect were the huge chunks of shell with my raw, slimy oysters. I seriously almost chipped a tooth on two different occasions! We also had the raw clams, which in my opinion, were better tasting than the oysters, but still had shell in them. Maybe if they would take a little more time to shuck them, less shell would be digested.. but I digress.We had the baked oysters and baked clams. They were both very good (I tend to prefer my shellfish cooked), the oysters are spicy- be aware of that. The sauce the clams were baked with was easily the best thing I tasted all night. We all sopped up the sauce in the bread that came with the clams.While the boys all ate boil and peel shrimp, I had the colossal crab (due to a very unfortunate and sad shrimp allergy). It was very good, sweet, creamy, and huge beautiful pieces of crab claw. Maybe this was my favorite thing all night. The boys all drank a little too much by the end, (after three G&T doubles, a shot of tequila and an Irish car bomb each) I am surprised our waiter didn't throw them all out! (do you see where the embarrassment is coming from now?)For five people, we spent over $400 with tip. I left hungry, because honestly, a few raw oysters and couple bites of crab does not equate to a full meal, and with a huge hole in my pocket. Maybe we will be back on someone else's dime next time.",Christie H.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,3,2005/8/14,"Ate here just last Night and ordered the Nawlins oysters and was very disappointed.  $11 for 3 small not so tasty oysters  just because they are spicy doesn't make them Cajun or Nawlins style.    Today I'm in NOLA and am enjoying half dozen of tasty oyster quadruple the size for the same price!! Overall I give this place 3 stars because drinks were ok. The Cod and quinoa was pretty tasty and Id visit again for a light bite or lunch.",MOJO J.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,3/26/15,The brunch took a while but was definitely worth waiting for.

The Pearl,578,4,5,10/31/13,"While visiting Columbus on business, a local friend took us to the Pearl. The food was excellent! I had the Atlantic Char which was cooked to perfection and had a delicious cauliflower side and sauce. I also could not resist trying the oysters. The Pearl has a great selection of oysters. They were fresh and tasty. Nice surprise in the midwest! The Pearl also makes an awesome Manhattan. I had to have two.My dining partner had the fried chicken and said it was the best he'd ever had outside of the south. And it was a huge portion.The atmosphere was lively. We were seated in the back and the noise level was fine. I look forward to going back. The seafood tower is calling to me!",Allison H.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,7/25/15,"Holy cow!  This place is incredible!  I came on resturant week and got their deal for $30. I got the cornbread, short rib and the banana cream pie. Hands down, the best on all three I've ever had. The short rib was so tender I couldn't even keep it on the fork!!!!!  Cornbread had the perfect texture with just the flavor of jalapeÌ±o and sweet butter and honey. To top it off the banana cream pie was perfect!  Killer vibe, incredible food, drinks, and amazing service on a busy Saturday. It's a bit pricy, but man worth every penny!",Chris B.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,2,9/25/14,"We sat on the bar, we just had a very light dinner and only drank a glass of the cheapest white wine each and we ended up paying 80 bucks. The food was good but not great, just average. I have eaten a lot better on cheaper places. It is not worth the wait and even less the price. Go here if you do not care at all about your finance and if nothing else on Short North is available. Enough said.",Corina P.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,4/21/13,"Just another CMR restaurant. The food/drinks/service is great as always. Oyster bar? They don't have an oyster bar for claiming to be an oyster bar. They have about 5 different oysters to choose from but they are priced at $10 for 3 (raw). Oyster bars are all about one thing (its in the name). They rest of the menu offers gastropub food including:The hanger steak with kimchi fried rice (highly suggested but the hanger steak being the cheapest cut of beef shouldn't cost $26)Devils on horseback (probably the best thing on the menu, dates wrapped in bacon)Good selection of craft beers on tap! St. Bernardus apt 12!",Roab P.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,3/17/13,"I have never in my life written an angry review, but then again I have never had a restaurant actually make me angry.  It's not the staff or the serviceable food but the complete disdain for design and comfort and aesthetics that is infuriating about Pearl.  Even if half the tables were removed, Pearl would still be an overstuffed, ugly, unappealing, rectangular Walmart of a restaurant, whose too obvious goal is to sell as much food as possible to as many people as possible -- to make money.  There is NO regard for beauty, charm, visual appeal, or design. Other than the comfy mini-oasis in the waiting area by the front window, I challenge customers to find a spot anywhere in the restaurant with an enjoyable feel and a pleasing view. The real grief about this place is that a prime location in the Short North is condemned to mediocrity for years to come.",Robert K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2003/1/15,What isn't there to love? The atmosphere is on point. The food is good and the service is awesome. I've had clam chowder before but nothing beats The Pearl's clam chowder. One sip of their soup and you will be hooked.,Tyi J.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,4,2/22/13,"I almost gave The Pearl 5 stars, but I guess I'll wait for my next visit to bump it up a notch.First, there's nothing like it in Columbus. Upon entering, it felt like a smaller version of Chicago's Paris Club, minus the Frenchy bits and add in American coastal preppy bits. Dark woods, casual, some industrial touches. The waitstaff is in casual-cool uniforms: think gingham and plaid shirts, wool vests, and the hostesses all in black with matching cool-luxe scarves. One of the restaurant areas features a cool marble bar-- I think this was the ""oyster"" area but I didn't inspect closely. On a large industrial cart with a butcher's block top was some kind of station that almost looks like a performance area. It seemed to be the finish/garnish stop for the plates before they come out. Food is definitely on parade here. I had as much fun looking at what was coming out as I did eating my dishes. It looks like a lot of thought goes into the presentation of the food.The menu is mostly American comfort food, with Eastern Seaboard themes and a few West Coast trends. We ordered oysters and deviled eggs to start. The deviled eggs came out on this adorable egg-weighing device like you might see at a small farm. And oh man-- they were freaking delicious. A deviled egg at a restaurant is a bit of a canary-in-the-mine test. If a restaurant can make a deviled egg worth ordering, it's a good sign. These were worth ordering, both because of preparation and presentation.We shared two entrees for our mains: the fried chicken (based largely on Bryant M's recommendation) and the hanger steak with fried egg, fried rice, and kimchi (I've said it  before, Korean is the new Japanese). Of the two, the chicken was the clear winner. When the plate was first set on the table, I thought the chicken was overdone, but the crispy skin looks dark more from the spice blend than from the fryer, methinks. It was phenomenal. The collard greens were phenomenal (I like a vinegary bite). The sweet roll on the side was PHENOMENAL. I'm not really a fan of sweet pastries, but the conversation stopped dead in its tracks while I had my special moment with this sweet roll. I was kind of pissed I had to share. The hanger steak was good. Not as good as the chicken, but good. The meat was cooked perfectly, but the kimchi/fried rice needs a better balance. It was too salty, maybe. Needed more veg in the rice (I spied a few mushrooms). The egg could have been runnier-- if it were runnier it might have chilled out the saltiness a bit.I agree with Stephanie K. that some items are a little over priced. The oysters were 3 for $8, which is definitely on the high end. I'd be interested to see if they start having a weekly special on oysters because if so, I'm there. Some of the menu items (like the Cuban) looked overpriced as well-- you can get a good Cuban for much less. Just use your noodle and read the ingredients list on the menu-- some things are priced fairly, but be smart about what you're really paying for. We also got our drank on. I ordered the gin fizz and the Moscow mule. The gin fizz was made with Watershed gin, and it was more light and refreshing than any other cocktail I've ever had. Sometimes I'm wary of Watershed's strong signature aftertaste when I'm drinking it with any kind of food, but the bartender somehow mellowed out that finish with the egg white or whatever. The Moscow mule was also bright and refreshing, but it had so much shaved ice in it that I had trouble getting to the last quarter of that precious liquid. My table mate's apple bourbon punch was neither too apple-y nor too bourbon-y. I want to order a bowl of it for the table when I can get back to The Pearl with a large group. The timing of our drinks was horrible, though. It took a long time to get the first round. Even though we ordered the drinks first, we were through our apps before we got our drinks. Our waiter did explain that it took so long because the bartender needed to remake mine, which I appreciated, but still. Then, our second round came after we were finished with the meal despite ordering it much earlier, so that second round became dessert. The bill comes in an old book, where patrons sign in the end papers. Super cute idea. Kinda adds to the Hampton-y prep vibe, like these books were left in someone's family summer home for decades. Anyway, I had a lovely evening at The Pearl. Not only do I want to come back again and again, but I'm inspired to work through (most) of the menu. I felt like I was on vacation.",Catherine J.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2004/6/16,"Might be the best brunch in Columbus - house smoked salmon and a bloody mary. The food is definitely a treat, you'll see for dinner the menu isn't cheap. But it's SO good and the inside decor is amazing. Brunch is reasonably priced and perfect for a couple or group. We're going here to celebration a graduation in May - that's saying a lot! Cameron Mitchel does it again.",Morgan D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,12/31/14,"I've been to Pearl a few times. I think the food is great, though the service neither bad nor particularly great. Last time I went we got fried curds, deviled eggs, and the spoon cornbread for appetizers. The curds were ridiculously addictive and I also got some new orleans baked oysters that were flavorful too. My entree was the shrimp and grits - super savory and intense, but I was so full from everything I ate before. I got a complimentary dessert for my birthday - Apple blackberry cobbler which, I must say, was incredible reheated a couple hours later when my stomach could accommodate it...I must say Pearl is pretty good.",Anna T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2/25/13,"I'm sorry Cap City, I think the Pearl might just have unseated you for my favorite CM restaurant. I still love you, I swear. I just think maybe it is time we see other people or you get the brie grilled cheese. All the great things you expect from a Cameron Mitchell restaurant: attention to detail, excellent and friendly service, innovative foods, a solid menu, clever theme, beautiful decor... I couldn't have been more pleased with my visit, considering I wasn't the one paying. Very impressive considering the growing pains most restaurants experience their first few months.My cohort and I started with the pot o pickles, the oven baked oysters and the spoon bread. All very good, loved the pickles that are made in house- but have to say my spoon bread is a little better... I will even give you the recipe if you want. Not complaining though. For dinner, I had the brie grilled cheese, which I saved up calories for all week and which cannot be described adequately in words though I will try. On brioche, with brie, pear preserves and a little pesto. Paired wonderfully with an arugula salad. It was quite possibly the tastiest grilled cheese I have ever experienced and I will do it again. Had a glass of wine, which was expensive but a heavy pour. The bill was actually surprisingly reasonable- the grilled cheese is only $12.00. They have punch bowls to share booze if you have 4 or so people.  Must go back to try.Great idea, very laid back- city meets southern charm. Love it, love it, love it. Make reservations.",Kate H.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,12/20/13,"The Pearl was spot-on from opening week and has been ever since. I've been in here a handful of times and each time has been easy, delicious, and consistently great.The interior of the restaurant gets major props. It's so comfy and inviting while still being hip and well thought out for its decor. The waitstaff has been super friendly and helpful, there when you need something but not hovering or in the way.I've never had a bad meal here. Some are better than others, but all the meals would be at least a 4 star. For appetizers you can't go wrong with the crispy fried curds, japaleno cornbread, or devils on horseback. I'm not an oyster fan so I can't give an opinion on half of their namesake. As far as dinner goes the Southern Fried Chicken is awesome (and the sticky bun that comes with it is really the grand prize of this meal). Ricotta dumplings are tasty, as is the brie and pear grilled cheese. A friend had the Pork Trio and said it was good but not amazing and that is the biggest complaint I've heard about this restaurant.The cocktails and drinks are great. When I came with friends we split the punch and it came in a little crystal bowl with little crystal cups. OMG just like when you had tea time with your stuffed toys only as an adult... with real people... and sweet sweet booze. In the fall I had something cider themed and it was amazeballs as well. This is a perfect date spot - delicious food in an upscale atmosphere without trying to hard or being too trendy. Definitely recommend.",Tara B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,2003/7/16,"I have to admit when the Pearl opened up 3 yrs ago, their food/menu was on point; however, 3 yrs later, and the menu, legit, has NOT changed whatsoever. I mean, of course, I expect there to be a lot of dishes that stay on the menu over the years at good restaurants, aka-the crowd pleasers/signature dishes, BUT they honestly haven't changed anything which leads to a boring, lackluster, mediocre dining experience. This seems to be a big syndrome of Cameron Mitchell restaurants as of late...a pattern, if you will...of really not trying all too hard to continue to develop and pursue a continuously changing and revolving menu. I believe most CM restaurants suffer from this problem, and the Pearl is just one of many. I desperately hope that they contemplate changing it up!!! Also, the last time I dined there, our dining experience suffered greatly from a poor management of the front of the house...there was a busboy that was sorting silverware in the front so loudly and for so long our entire table couldn't literally not hear our conversation. Our waiter only offered to us ONCE for a drink for the entirety of our meal and we were there for 2 hrs. Overall, disappointing. Thumbs down!!",bethany p.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2009/9/13,"I'd been wanting to try this place for weeks before I finally went a few days ago.I wasn't disappointed. A few tips, though:- DON'T get the oysters. I'm not sure why this place advertises itself as an oyster room when the oysters are pretty mediocre at best. Admittedly, I'm not sure where you'd find good oysters in Ohio.- Get the grapefruit punch! It is excellent.- My favorite part of dinner was the hanger steak. It is REALLY good combined with kimchee fried rice.- Was also able to grab a bite of a friend's ricotta dumplings, which were also decent.",Audrey H.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2002/6/13,"This place is great! Seriously. We went there last night for the opening. We've been before to the CM's restaurants but I wouldn't say we liked them a lot. I'm just more into a little bit different style of eating, food etc. But oyster bar always sounds good to me, so we made a reservation 2 weeks in advance.The place was completely full and it was very nice crown of people. Pople who know why and what for they are there, people who know the definition  for every item on the menu.The interior is beautiful, waiting area is nice makes you feel relaxed while sipping a glass of wine/ cocktail and waiting for the table to be ready. Stuff is amazing. Everybody seems to be very professional and friendly. Even on the opening night you don't feel like there is a distance, something might have been forgotten or anything like this. We had to wait a little (extra 10-15 min) but we didn't really feel it, 'cause the cocktails were so good and it gave us time to look around.The bar.To start with we are not the people who get easily surprised by drinks or food. We tried enough and made enough, so when it comes to this field we kind of know what it is really supposed to be. I tried Bourbon Apple Punch, while my husband had Scofflaw. Both were really good. Beyond ours expectations (we are used only to having good quality drinks at Mouton so it was nice to have it else where).  Punch was soft and nice, while Scofflaw had more complex taste. You can tell that there was an effort put into making these guys. The portions are pretty big by the way. Later we  tried Moscow Mule and Manhattan. Manhattan is a barrel aged and thus is softer than the normal Manhattan. It comes with the best from all the cherries Luxardo cherries. Moscow Mule comes in the copper mug and tastes as good as it looks.The food.I haven't really noticed people around eating. I saw a few french fries baskets and it was pretty much it.The only item I really wanted to try was a Shellfish Tower (Dozen oysters and Clams on the Half Shell, Half Pound Peel & Eat Gulf Shrimp, Louie Dressed Colossal Crab, Cocktail Sauce, Horseradish Mignonette) which costs $90. But there is definitely no reason to try to it because it you can easily get the same set at the North Market or Whole Foods for a better price and also, there is no way to judge the ""food"" and quality and cooking by ordering raw seafood.So  we skipped all the starters, cause they didn't look any appealing. Appetizers looked better, but two items we ordered were probably the only two items I'd like to try anyways:Charcuterie board (Foie Gras Terrine, Hard Salami, Chicken Liver Parfait, Country Ham, House Made Pickles) and House Smoked Salmon with Poached Egg, Brioche, Scallion Tartar Sauce.Charcuterie board surprises with the size. Two of us were not able to finish it. Chicen pate had too much of a butter flavour to me ( I like the taste of liver, not the butter), pickles were very good and all the rest were pretty good two. Salmon, again, was a good entree size. It was very tender, had light smoky flavour and silky taste. Probably my favorite from all. Poached egg is my favorite type of cooked egg, but it wasn't runny at all, so I didn't like it. Tartar was extremely good though!We also had oysters. One of each from the East Coast. Well, oysters are just oysters. They turn into OYSTERS when you are on the coast only. So..but horseradish mignonette and a cocktail sauce were delicious (normally I eat oysters with just a lemon a juice).All the entree items sounded a little bit to heavy to my taste, but I assume they all are very good.The place is really good. I dont think We will be back for oysters (cause it was the less impressive part of our dinner), but we will definitely stop by sometime in the summer when the windows will be open to try other cocktails and share an appetizer.",Daria F.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2002/6/13,"Four of us headed out to the Pearl for their opening night.  It was bustling!  Totally full and the staff really hustling around.  The ladies weren't done admiring the decor before we were seated.Mark was our server and did an outstanding. He knew the menu, didn't oversell, but provided helpful insights. There are a lot of items on the menu we will want to go back and try.  Last night, we had theClam Chowder - really good, maybe outstandingDevil's on horseback - bacon wrapped dates - loved them, savoryShort ribs - terrificHangar steak - perfectly cooked and in a really great saucGrilled cheese - I didn't try it, but the word is very good.Burger - expensive at $15, but maybe the best in town.We didn't even get to The seafood and shellfish.  This will be a destination dining experience in Columbus.",Ralph B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,2008/6/13,"My group of five met there on Wednesday the 31st of July.  The atmosphere was great.  We had a table next to the big open windows.   To start, we had the rollmops, devils on horseback and the crispy fried curds.  The rollmops were good.  Pickled herring was good.  The curds didn't' taste like cheese curds to me or anyone at the table and they went largely uneaten.  The devils on horseback were not exciting and could have used a spicy sauce to balance the sweetness.The burger was over cooked  and the fish 'n chips wasn't liked much.  Both were served with luke warm fries.  I don't understand why the simple things can't simply be done.  The ricotta dumplings were good as was the beet salad.  We might go back, but there are certainly a lot more options to consider for considering a return to this establishment.",Andrew A.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2002/10/13,"The Pearl is great, and welcome change to the food scene in the short north. The food is top notch, but appreciate the laid back atmosphere of the Pearl. The menus has numerous options of fun, classic, feel good food in addition to the obvious oysters on the menu.Our table started with oysters that were fresh, delicious cornbread, devils on horseback, and the fried cheese curd. All were fantastic. For the main mean I had the hangar steak which was cooked to perfection and had a great Korean vibe with the kimchi rice. I also tasted the fried chicken (fantastic) and fish and chips were absolutely huge.As for the atmophere the Pearl was packed, but to be expected the first week. The space isn't the largest or the most quiet. So if you're looking for quiet and intimate you may want to look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a fun, unique restaurant in Columbus the Pearl will leave you happy.The service is great, the staff was very nice and knowledge on all the food including nuances between oysters and the dishes.Overall I loved the Pearl and will be heading back soon. So many items on the menu looked great and service was top notch.",Jeremy J.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,3/17/13,"Wanted to see what all the buzz was about so made a reservation for 8PM on a Saturday night...FOOD: inspired menu, nice presentation, great quality and quite tastySERVICE: they try, but they're still a bit of a mess, 30 minutes to get to our table even with a reservation. drinks and food are equally slow to arrive on a busy nightSCENE: definitely hip, picking up on the gastropub theme, with a speakeasy vibe, but a bit over the top... (your bill arrives in an vintage hardcover book. read on for more excruciating detail)The Pearl has a great theme and is a good compliment to the Cameron Mitchell fleet and will likely pop up in other locations quickly. There's just a few things that irk me:The scene is so contrived that it just get's silly after a while. Everything is done with a purpose, but that same purpose seems kind of transparent. Examples range from water served in mason jars (interesting at first, annoying after a few sips) to yellow-hued exposed lighting (yay, I'm dining in a sepia photograph, fantastic), to the bill that arrives in a hardcover book (even the bartender seemed a little annoyed with this bit of theater...wasn't a very good read either). I couldn't help thinking by the end of the night, that I was in 2013's answer to 1993's TGI Friday's...The food is really quite good and way more authentic than the decor. The menu has a lot of variety. The menu  mashup between an oyster house and steak tavern doesn't quite make sense, but everything is prepared really well with uniqueness, based on simple dishes that have been around forever. Example:  The hanger steak is a modern twist on bibimbap. If you enjoy staring uncomfortably at other guests, ask for the corner table in the back room. You'll feel like like Jim Lehrer moderating the presidential debate.I'd probably go back....",Andrew M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,7/28/14,Still a big fan after visiting and partaking in the gluten-free menu. Even the bar staff is knowledgeable and made sure that the AMAZING cioppino special was safe for me to eat. Spending a Saturday night at the bar was quite the amusing experience. Lots of good people watching and fun folks!,Allison C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,6/18/13,"This is one of those times I wish we had half stars, because this place sits more at a 3.5 for me. In full disclosure, I've only been once (this past weekend).Two initial thoughts:- I'd tried coming here once before with a group of friends. My friend called on Monday for a Friday reservation and they were fully booked. When she asked if we could swing by, the hostess told her not to because they didn't leave any tables for walk-ins. Um, what?- The atmosphere is fun, and this place is deceptively big. That being said, it's pretty dim once you move further back into the restaurant.Food + service:I came here with my boyfriend and his parents for Sunday brunch. We loved the New Orleans baked oysters (that broth, yum!). We ordered a slew of dishes - including the grilled cheese, tavern benny, fried chicken, and huevos rancheros. I will say that my huevos rancheros, while not absurdly small, was about 1/3 of the side of the other plates and I couldn't find the chorizo at all in my dish.The service was great, and our waitress was attentive and friendly. I do think this place tries really hard to be in Brooklyn. From every waitperson wearing flannel shirts to the mason jar water glasses, you might get a hipster vibe. If that's not off-putting to you (it's not for me!), I'd suggest giving it a shot. My taste of the fried chicken was satisfying enough that I'd go back and order that again. I'm also curious to try out the (raw) oysters next time; the selection does seem a little paltry (and the prices a little steep) for a place that touts itself as an oyster bar, but that's just my opinion.",Jess G.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2/19/13,"Another Cameron Mitchell staple! The Pearl just opened on High Street and it is top notch! My friends and I went the 2nd weekend it was opened... How? I randomly went on Open Table and found at 7:45 perfect timing reservation! Someone must have canceled as I had checked all week and it was booked solid. We were alittle weary of going as we weren't too impressed and excited about their menu-- the menu items seemed interesting and we didn't know if we would be able to find something we would like. Well... we were wrong.So, the experience! We got in slightly before our reservation and had to wait about 20 minutes so we went up to the bar. The upfront waiting area is nice; nice big couches; however, it was crowded. I take this as a good sign- I mean, it should be crowded...it just opened! We went to the bar and each got a drink- Moscow Mule, Citrus Punch and Ramos Gin Fuzz. All the drinks were great! They also had a great variety of drinks on the menu, that it was hard to decide what to get. For $10 a drink, it needs to be great, and they were! When we got to the table, we believed we had prime seating! Tucked away between both rooms in a spacious booth, right under the mouth-watering dessert board. The waiter was very nice and detailed out the menu for us. We ended up ordering the recommended Devils on Horseback (bacon-wrapped dates)- they were so delicious, but small, made you want more! It was a slight tease... but a good one! We then ordered some grilled cheeses and the hanger steak.  I know we should have ordered oysters, and we will next time... As we were enjoying ourselves, waiting for the food, we didn't even realize that it had taken slightly a little long until the manager came up to apologize. He said that since the chef is a ""perfectionist"" he wasn't pleased with how our food came out and wanted to remake them. In the meantime, he brought us another round of drinks for free! When our food finally arrived, everything was top notch delicious! Another manager stopped by to see how it was, and even brought us a free basket of fries- which is the key to my heart!  Everyone was super nice, making it an unexpected delightful, fun experience! Dessert- we got crack...pie! And boy was it crack! Topped with some Jeni's ice cream, it was delicious! Again, we were impressed more and more as the night went on.When we felt that the restaurant couldn't get any better... the bills came and they were in these old, worn out books. They also invited you to sign the inside of the books.  I thought this was so extremely creative and unique- I have never been to a place that did that! It was very cool. Overall, we went here not knowing what to expect as the menu items looked a little odd and we have never heard of/nor been to a GastroPub... but we didn't expect the greatness that we experienced. We are so happy and excited that this place came to the Short North and we are looking forward to going again and again! This will be one of our staple weekend restaurants!",Taylor S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2/13/13,"Another great place by Cameron Mitchell! I love the upscale food with a cool casual atmosphere. Water glasses are the cutest small mason jar looking cups and the Moscow Mule was delicious. My friend and I tried the Old Fashioned Deviled Eggs, 6 oysters on the half shell, the Chicken Wing Confit and the Pub Burger. The oysters were everything we were expecting and the deviled eggs were creamy and tasty. The burger and chicken wings were the real stand outs. We didn't expect anything outstanding from chicken wings but these ones were the best, fall of the bone, flavorful wings I've ever even imagined of tasting. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium warm pink center but the Cambozola cheese and tomato jam were what made the burger a stand out from any other burger I've tasted. I'm excited to try out their brunch that is starting in a few weeks!!",Sabrina T.,,,,,,

The oysters are the best I have had in Columbus.  The brunch is REALLY good.  I got the chicken and waffles and the hubs got the poutine and washed them down with great bloody marys (they come with sidecars of high life).  One hint: get the spoonbread, you won't regret it.  When we went for dinner I got shrimp and grits and the hubs got the pub burger they were both delicious and cooked perfectly.  Lastly, the service...it is fantastic.  The servers are knowledgeable, friendly, and quick.  Now I am day dreaming about a bloody mary.  MMM...",Katie B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2002/9/13,"I'll give it 5-stars for the spot-on opening.  Visited for Happy Hour on Friday.  They opend at 4PM, I got there at about 4:15, by 4:45, the place was packed!  Service was excellent.  Appetizers were served quickly.  The beers were great. The Rollmops were very good... they're pickled herring but better than others I've had before.  The chicken wings were also excellent and as advertised, extremely tender. The hot sauce served with them had good flavor and the blue cheese dip also was tasty, My only (minor) issue with the wings were they seemed just a tad too salty.  The space is exceptional.  They did a great job building this place out. So we now have another great spot to hit in the Short North thanks to Cameron and Company!  Great Job!",Augie W.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,2004/5/16,"I have dined with friends many times and loved the Pearl, the atmosphere, the servers, the food everything was wonderful.   My last visit was horrible, I reserved a table for four but it was set for three.   The waiter didn't notice it until we asked for a 4th place setting.  The food was horrible and we were rushed to eat and felt we were being pushed out of the door.   That was my last visit; there are plenty of great Columbus restaurants that appreciate their customers.",Rebecca L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,4/14/13,"So this is the new place everyone has been talking about. The new addition to the Cameron Mitchell list has been on the top of my Must Try list since I heard about it. If you're familiar with my reviews, you know I don't go out to fancy expensive places often, but my boyfriend and I decided this was the spot to try for his birthday dinner. We made a reservation for 8:15 pm last night, a Saturday. We actually got there a little early and were seated right away(that might have something to do with the fact that I called to confirm my reservation, so they knew I was serious). We did have to wait 5 minutes, but understandable as we were early. We overheard the host telling these 2 girls that walked in without a reservation that a table wouldn't be available until about 10:30...so MAKE A RESERVATION. We sat down at our table and right away...I started to notice some similarities between this joint and my favorite new Columbus restaurant, 101 Beer Kitchen. For example, the mason jars, the jug of water on the table, the simple cloth napkins, the old books(101 uses old books for their drink menus, here your checks come in one), the thick butcher block tables, and the overall decor was so similar. In fact, that's the reason I'm knocking off a star. I LOVE 101 Beer Kitchen and it feels like this place is kind of ripping it off. And that made me a little mad. As far as the food goes, you can't really go wrong. We started with the Rollmops, which I had never heard of before. A rollmop is a filet of pickled herring wrapped around a dill pickle with sour cream, onions, celery, and parsley. I loved it. I was worried it would be super fishy, but it had a great balance of fish flavor, salty, sweet, and sour. Then, we each had some oysters. I went with the Nawlins Style baked oysters. They were spicy and cheesy and came with a great chunk of crusty bread to soak up all the juice. My boyfriend just had the oysters on the half shell. It came with 3 and fresh horseradish. I thought the oysters were a little overpriced. But our entrees were incredible. I had the hanger steak. It was a pineapple marinated steak served with kimchi fried rice and a fried egg. I loved Korean food and this was perfect. My boyfriend had the Pork Trio, which he said contained the best pork chop he's ever had. The bite I tried was awesome. In all, I loved the food here, but I probably won't be back until the fuss of the new restaurant is all over.",Emily L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2/15/13,"Really cool atmosphere, good food, great service.  REALLY loud & bustly - obviously - because it's the cool new kid on the block.We went on opening weekend, and it was SLAM crowded.  Like I was at a rave.  We had 9:00 reservations and didn't get sat until a little after 10.  Not a huge deal - obviously no one wanted to get up so they weren't turning over tables, and the people there were so nice and accommodating and gave us a free app.  We also didn't really care because we were just happy to be there hanging out.  Great dirty martini.  Really good burger.I have been back since a few times - once for Brunch (AWESOME), another few times for early-evening cocktails (perfect for this, and for people watching), etc.  Cocktails are always great.  BEST APP ON THE MENU is the Smoked Salmon.  Healthy Portion for not a lot of coin, and it's absolutely freaking delicious.Also reviewed it here: http://covetliving.com/gus/holiday-staycation/",Stephanie B.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,4,2007/10/13,"Visiting from out of town, we celebrated my dad's retirement here during their brunch. Walking in, I was quite impressed with the decor and the atmosphere. We had a great table in the back and it wasn't too busy which was nice. Our waiter was great and made excellent  recommendations. I was feeling rich, so I got the $18 fried chicken. I've had better on the south side of Chicago but still good. The greens were amazing though! I had none leftover and kind of wished I kept them to myself instead of letting my family try.Get the pie! We got two slices to go and they were excellent. I forget what they called if, but it's a take off of crack pie. I was so inspired from it, I made one later that afternoon!Also the checks come in a book. So cute! You can write in it which is nice if you're celebrating something like our group was. Really great place and I'll be sure to return next time I'm in Ohio.",Lauren T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,5/28/13,"I have made a few trips to the Pearl and each time I have been delighted. First, reservations are a must! Their cocktails are delicious, and reasonably priced. The service is absolutely top notch. On one visit my cake was late according to the waiter (I didn't notice) so he didn't charge me for it. I was more than content with his apology (because I didn't notice) but he insisted. The staff is pleasant and attentive. I highly recommend the pork trio. My mouth is watering simply thinking about it! The atmosphere is causal but classy. Great place to take a date.",Jesse L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,5/31/13,"Incredible! Amazing ambiance, terrific food, and an overall fantastic dining experience. Service was helpful and friendly.Be sure to try the Devils on Horseback-- they're bacon-wrapped dates. Unreal.",Kevin B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,2005/7/15,I decided to bring my guests from out of town to give the place another shot But was very disappointed with food and the 2 drinks I ordered. The first one was an old fashion that was watery and tasted very weird and not even close to any old fashion so I drank a quarter of my glass and thought to order something else. I got the other drink which was a Mexican mule that I had to return because it was tasteless and the server excuse was that this is how we make it and every place makes it different. Food was nothing impressive at all after my tongue was on fire due to the tremendous amount of hot spices that they put in my shrimps and grits. I will never come back again.,Critic M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2007/3/15,"We have been to the Pearl four times now and if they had a back room, I'd sleep there.  We are oyster geeks but if you have deviled eggs and love deviled eggs, just order them, sit back, and enjoy.  Add to that the beet salad and I just wanted to lick the bowl and to be gracious to the other diners, I did not.  We were there during a time when a bus boy spilled a pitcher of water on my lap.  I could've made a scene, threw things at the wall, but the manager gave us free drinks and again, graciously I didn't stand up because everyone would have thought I wet myself.  To the food.  Fried chicken, fried chicken, fried chicken.  It was incredible and with sticky buns and amazing greens, I would leap over KFC buckets to get some more. My husband knew I couldn't finish the chicken so he ordered the bangers and mash for his meal.  Attention Schmidts, there's a new sausage restaurant in town.  Wow and with mashed potatoes, well, I could've kissed the chef on the lips.  Run, don't walk, to this place! This is our favorite restaurant and if you happened to see a girl who looked like she wet herself, just laugh because she got her drinks on the house!",Annie W.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,2002/11/16,"Great food and atmosphere. The service was a lot slower than a typical Cameron Mitchell restaurant. Plus they messed up our check and when I sent it back to pay the manager came back and didn't run my credit card and failed to run the gift card I bought. Just trying to pay and leave took 30 minutes. This is our second time and we love the HH specials and the specialty cocktails are awesome. But, this experience left a lot to be desired and this was my fiancÌ©e and my Valentine's Day dinner since she will be out of town on Sunday. Not the best experience and not a typical Cameron Mitchell experience!",Craig F.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,9/26/14,"The Pearl has super expensive, but delicious food and drinks if you are into that thing. For the price, you would expect some level of competence from the serving staff at an establishment such as this. My first and only time going to The Pearl was decent overall but shrouded by some unpleasantness. Our server hardly paid us any mind the entire night, no one's water glass was never refilled, and he took my girlfriends leftovers faster than she could speak and threw them away even though she was planning on saving them. She is very kind and didn't want to make a scene but the dude threw away 1/3 of a $15 burger and a bunch of fries.My two cents: there are too many other restaurants with great food in Columbus for WAY less than The Pearl and probably better service too.",Brett S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2003/8/16,"I love Cameron Mitchell restaurants. This is a great one, especially on a busy Friday short north evening. The drink I had was the scofflaw and it introduced me to a fabulous drink!  I love the oysters and the seafood tower or terrine. Not sure of name. Waitstaff is fun too.",Nancy M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,4/27/13,"I went here for my wife's birthday and we couldn't have been more excited.  At first glance, I don't really get the oyster bar theme.  Yes, they have oysters, but it isn't a seafood restaurant.  It actually more of a diner.   Starting off, the drinks were a fortune.  $50 including a normal tip for 4 drinks.  The Mule and the punch was all ice.   The Scofflow (sp?) was pretty good.  The bar was packed and it was hard to move.  We were seated and immediately were brought champagne for the birthday.  Very nice.  The seating was a bit cramped and their really doesn't seem to be any ""ideal"" tables.  We were in between two couples and you can't help but be involved in their conversations.   We ordered the dates and the devised eggs, but they never came.  Other couples were receiving their entrees as we were asking about our apps.   The server only brought one of them and comped us even though he said ""you never ordered apps""?   He spent the rest of the meal trying to over please which was annoying. I had the chicken and cinnamon role.  Despite what I had heard, the roll was very average.  The chicken was cooked well but it was three thighs and one dummy.  The greens were bland.  My wife had the salmon which was the special.  She was happy.   Dinner was only $60 with 2 drinks, champagne, and a cake even though the bar drinks were outrageous.  Overall an average experience.  If you light heavy food, this is a must.  If you want seafood, don't bother. We live in the burbs.  We will probably try everything else downtown before ever coming back.",Craig O.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2003/2/15,Best oysters I've ever had! Great drinks and service. The pub burger was fantastic. The tomato jam that comes with it is phenomenal!!,Eric I.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2010/6/13,"This place was good.  That's it.We got the jalepeno cornbread and it was kind of dry.  OK, nothing amazing.  We ordered many kinds of oysters and they were OK.  As usual for a Cameron Mitchell restaurant, the service was great.One thing that was amazing was the Moscow Mule cocktail.  Mmmmmm.",Brigid N.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2/24/15,"You can't really go wrong with a Cameron Mitchell restaurant.  Seriously, I have almost been to all of them.The Pearl is by my apartment and I have been here several times.  Probably one of the only places I may actually order oysters (I'm from the east coast, so seafood in the midwest seriously frightens me).  Hands down, the best Moscow Mule in town too.In general, I think the menus at most Cameron Mitchell restaurants are all over the place.  They try to please too many people that they lack any distinct direction.  Besides a few signature items, if you've been to one, you've been to them all.  That said, the food is always great, which keeps me coming back.What you do get with the different C. Mitchell restaurants is the varying ambiance that each of them has.  The Pearl has a great American bistro feel, that makes me feel like I'm back in NYC.  I've had the shrimp and grits, both the steaks, chicken, and lamb shank.  Never been disappointed.I do have one quam... And this is a mute point because I have a gluten allergy and can't even eat this... But who pairs a cinnamon sticky bun with fried chicken?  Don't get me wrong, I see where it's coming from.  Back in the day, when I could eat it, I loved fried chicken and waffles...  But the idea of a sticky bun just kind of grosses me out.  I won't judge though.",Tim H.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,6/25/14,"I was intrigued by The Pearl from the moment I saw a story on the local news. After trying twice to go there for lunch ( they open at 4), some friends and I had dinner there recently and it was as enjoyable as I hoped. When we arrived, there weren't many people there. The hostess sat five of us at a high table right near the bar.  We asked to be moved to a booth and I'm glad we did. Within a short time, the place was packed and we would have been smack in the middle of a high traffic area, a definite deterrent for me. Our server was personable and his recommendations seemed genuine. He was attentive and enjoyable to interact with. The appetizers tempted me to pass on dinner. Our party of five each ordered one and we shared. I've never been to a restaurant that serves deviled eggs-a personal favorite. The jalapeÌ±o corn bread and honey butter upgraded another traditional favorite. We washed them down with Moscow Mules served iced in a pewter mug. The clean flavor balanced the somewhat dense appetizers. The shrimp and grits entree was also a twist on a traditional dish. Chorizo and poblano peppers added a slight kick to the mild shrimp and grits. What initially looked like a small serving turned out to be the perfect size. We shared dessert as we did the appetizers. It was unanimous that the apple berry pie ala mode was the favorite. A very close second was the brown sugar pie. I never tasted the Boston Cream or Snickers pie. I was too busy grabbing forkfuls of the others. The Pearl is worth a visit on a hungry day. Our group is already planning our next visit.",Deb C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,6/22/14,"I was able to use Open Table to get a reservation 15 minutes before we arrived during gallery hop. Still amazed by that. The vibe of the restaurant is really laid back while still feeling formal. The oysters were delicious, and absolute top quality, it was like they had just come from the ocean which was refreshing for an ocean sick east coaster. The wine list was a little lacking while being over priced. The staff was friendly and welcoming. I would certainly go again.",Yo T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,2012/3/14,"We went here because our friends raved about it. I wasn't very impress, it's very crowded. And the food was not worth the money. I got Louisiana chicken and oysters. Oysters were very poorly presented for the amount we paid. Was not very fresh.",Tracy N.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,3/14/13,"I went to The Pearl last night for a Birthday dinner. We had a table of 5 and sat down for our reservation at 6:30. Drinks: It took over 25 minutes to get our bottle of wine and two martinis. The waitress did come back after about 10 minutes to tell us that the bar was really backed up. I'm grateful she did so, so we had a clue what was going on, but it's still no excuse. This isn't Cameron Mitchell's first restaurant, and I'm sure all of the waiters/waitresses are experienced. What was the deal with that?Appetizers: Our appetizers came well before our drinks. We got the Seafood Tower, Devils on Horseback and the Jalapeno Corn Bread. When ordering the Seafood Tower, the waitress was kind enough to tell us that most people leave behind the Clams and asked if we wanted to double-up on the Oysters instead of receiving the Clams. We followed her suggestion and the men at the table gobbled all two-dozen Oysters right up, along with the crab and peel-and-eat Shrimp. The Devils on Horseback were DELISH, and I don't think I've ever eaten a date. Jalapeno Corn Bread was delicious, and the butter that came on the side had freshly-poured honey on top. Yum!Main Course: My parents had the Arctic Char and loved the dish. I had the Steak, but substituted the sides that came with is with the sides that came with the Short Ribs. I enjoyed the Steak, but with the $40 price tag, you're better off going down to Hyde Park. All of the Entrees looked delicious. I liked the design of the restaurant and all of the small details, like the ""plates"" that the steaks and short ribs were served in. I will definitely be back, but might let them work out some of their service kinks. 25 minutes for drinks (let alone waiting 20+ minute after ordering a second round) is ridiculous",Chelsea C.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,3/19/13,"Affordable for the average foodie in all of us. This restaurant is a cute concept and seems that others agree because it gets BUSY! Make a reservation if you can or go at off peak times. If you can overlook the hipster appeal you might fall in love. All the servers have beards and wear vests and everything about this restaurant seems to scream trendy, which can be intimidating. Service is good. The waiters (I am assuming they hire women waitresses too but didn't see any) are very knowledgeable about every detail of the food and drink list, which is great but can be annoying at times when they go on an on. I think they want to educate people and be helpful but it was a bit much. The beet salad was yummy and the fried chicken was delicious. Pies were good but not to die for, not even the crack pie. There is a common theme, they care about quality. This restaurant is affordable upscale and fun if you like trying new things.",Melissa S.,,,,,,

We were able to sit at the windows in the overstuffed leather chairs and enjoy a light breeze and good conversation.  As for the food, the Devils On Horseback were fantastic especially when washed down with the North High Brewing Oyster Stout.  The flavors of these two items complemented one another quite well.  We also sampled the deviled eggs and the jalapeno spoon bread which were good, but not as great as the devils on horseback.Our server, Hannah, was attentive but not intrusive which allowed our group to further enjoy the evening.This place is a must for those in the area.

He completely made up for the fact that we had to wait for him... waiting for Mark was the best decision of my life. So then we asked to speak to the manager, we got Cliff who ended up being the most amazing human being on the planet. The fact that the entire staff took extra time to make sure we were completely satisfied with our experience was so amazing and so refreshing.

The first Moscow mules were watery, but they immediately replaced them. The replacement was better.  The hanger steak and rice plate was amazing and my husband thought the fried chicken with the sticky bun was delicious.The 2person toppers are close which lend the people to talk to each other.

The Pearl,578,4,2,5/28/14,"I normally don't review, however when things are not just right I have say something. High end tavern type atmosphere. Very comfortable. However when a dozen oysters cost almost $40.00 and the least expensive bottle of red wine is close to the same amount and a very small salad is $9.00 and a very small Skye vodka is $10.00 its time to say hey...this is not NY city and we do not have waiters walking around in black ties....this is a Tavern. Food was very tasty, but portions were small. I am not a buffet type person...but when a short rib costs $27 and there is hardly anything to share on a ala cart I sometimes wonder. Last but not least from the hostess who was in a hurry to seat us, when we were talking to a friend in the lobby to the waiter who kept saying are you ready, are you done, can I get your check...we were there approx. 1.15 hours. and spent $200.00 not including tip and only 5 drinks for 4 people.Maybe we should of stuck with burgers and beer...",Terry K.,,,,,,

The place was very busy and we had a 45 minute wait, but it was worth it. Everybody was very friendly and courteous. We ordered the clam chowder which unfortunately was a little cold. We also ordered oysters which were half off today and fresh!! They tasted great. Another small appetizer that was good was the dressed blue shell crab. The dressing was a little sweet and creamy. The crab was Pre shelled and arrived in a very small bowl and was also very good. We decided to share the steak dinner which was a ribeye steak. They split it for us which was very nice. They also gave us each an individual baked potato instead of splitting One between us.Everyone in the restaurant was very friendly and accommodating.

The Pearl,578,4,1,5/18/14,"All show, no substance. Place looks great, but the drinks and food were off. Manhattans were small and mostly sweet vermouth, which is a crime to this eater from KY. Bacon wrapped dates would've been better left alone instead of topped with a cilantro relish and drowned in oil. Ramen was weird - spices didnt seem to fit, there was hardly any ""pork tenderloin"" in it, and the more we tried it the more we were convinced of its failure. Are they trying little moments of asian ingredients in these dishes? I would suggest sticking to what they know. Service was impatient and a lityle pushy, like we were at lunch at applebees and he was trying to max out the bill (which was way too high for such a mediocre experience) and turn the table over asap.

The Pearl,578,4,4,1/24/15,"Very good oysters, presentation, reasonably priced, and great desserts. Best Moscow mule and Bloody Mary I've had in awhile too. Only downside is that the server said dessert was on him for my birthday but it ended up on a plate, not him. Kidding, sorta. Great restaurant, highly recommend it!",Jordan B.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,4,9/22/13,"My dinner was great. I feel like the menu was a little limited so you need to have a specific craving for what they serve. The service was great. I even ordered a specialty drink and the waiter brought me a different one because I didn't like it. Free of charge. It is a little crowded and noisy, but the short north doesn't have a lot of space to begin with . I recommend getting a reservation. We went on an off night and it was packed. We would have had to wait forever to get a table.",Adelle R.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,11/15/14,"The Pearl was recommended to us last year but we had to wait an entire year before we could make a return trip to Columbus. Well, it was certainly worth he wait!!  The service was excellent. Our server was very knowledgable on the menu and she made some excellent suggestions. First, the Moscow Mules are the best we had ever had. Then for a starter we tried  the Devils on Horseback which were fabulous!  For the main course the hanger steak and the short ribs did not disappoint. For dessert...it was some more Moscow Mules!! Overall it was a great meal and wonderful evening. You will enjoy The Pearl!!",Todd K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2001/7/16,"So very good.  Columbus does not have great wings in my opinion, and wings are far from what you expect at an upscale oyster bistro, but they are great.  Slowly cooked in duck fat and not overly sauced, they are very tasty.  Kale salad gets a solid B+ and the burger was amazing.  Good add to the Short North.",JC R.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,9/17/13,AWESOME!  The Cesar salad was the absolute best ever!!!!  It literally seemed like the lettuce was infused with air (sounds crazy I know).  So light and fluffy!  The Cuban was amazing as well!  Great ambiance!!,Stacy S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2001/6/15,"My experience at the Pearl was generally excellent. We were shown quickly to a nice table, our staff was attentive and appropriate. And the food was very nice. I've knocked off a star for two reasons: first, my date's scallops were slightly overcooked (no hate here; they're brutally hard to get exactly right) and second, their cooling system for their draft beer was broken. I understand that these things happen but one reasonably expects the chance to have a good draft beer at a nice restaurant. My dinner would have been a better experience if I weren't drinking out of a bottle.Parties at surrounding tables were pleasant and well-behaved, the noise level was engaged but still made conversation possible, and the prices, while a touch high for Columbus, were representative of the restaurant's location and were justified by the overall food quality. I will add that they make excellent cocktails and nobody attempted to oversell us on any food or desserts.",Don S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2011/7/15,"After using Yelp for reviews for years my dinner(s) at the Pearl warranted my first review. My colleagues and I were visiting for a conference and were so blown away by the food we came back again before leaving. The table favorite on both occasions was the smoked salmon. Seriously, order it and prepare to be amazed. The chicken wings were cooked to perfection, perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The ricotta dumplings were also a standout but honestly every single thing was amazing. I'm a foodie & eat at hundreds of restaurants a year and The Pearl is among the top 10.",Heather W.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,7/18/14,"Mark C. is the best waiter, ever. He took care of us from the moment we sat down. The food was delicious and the drinks were phenomenal. We will be coming back to the Pearl every chance we get.",Hai T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,5/23/13,"Finally made our first trip to The Pearl last night.Despite being later on a Wednesday night, it was very busy, so reservations are definitely a must. We had a cozy booth away from the kitchen, which made me feel like we'd lucked out. I think it definitely would have been annoying to have sat at some of the tables out in the main thoroughfare near a busy and bustling kitchen.They seem to have their timing down already, as our server was attentive and the food/drinks came out quickly.We enjoyed the jalapeno spoon corn bread to start, along with some oysters. Both were great. The shrimp was good, as was the fried chicken. The food was solid and of good quality, but the pricing seems a tad high overall.A big highlight was the lemon meringue pie that came in its own individual tart. It seems that the pastry chef here is a big strength.Overall, we enjoyed the first visit and would probably be back, but definitely by booking reservations first. This doesn't seem like a place that will ever be easy to walk in to for a table!Side note: valet is available for $6 and was well-staffed.",Mary N.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,7/21/14,"Everything you cant want in a restaurant. The food, excellent. The service, outstanding. The alcohol selection, superb. This place is perfect for diner before heading out to enjoy the rest of short north or it can be the destination itself. If you want to go all out and really treat yourself you can but the menu is set up so you don't have to spend a fortune to enjoy top notch dining if you don't want to. Even with the excellent seafood, entrees and appetizers the item to get is the beet salad. Out of this world. This place is a Columbus must try!",Andrew G.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,2010/6/14,"Decided to try yesterday afternoon (10/5/14). It wasnt one of mine better choices.  We were greet with "" How can we help you?"" We should have turn and walked out at this question,  but sadly we stayed and were seated in the back of the restaurant.  For a sunday afterNoon,  this place was slow, slow enough that out drinks shouldn't have been as long as a wait that they were. Then trying to order our starters was like pulling teeth.  And the choice  to leave was made for us when one started came out a good 8 minutes before the other. We had planned to order a late lunch but, didnt want to wait for the dinner rush to come AND go before we got to even order. How long does it take to fry up an order of the cheese curds?. Its seems longer than to cook the bacon on the devil on horseback. The service for a Cameron Mitchell place should have been  light years better than it was. I felt that it was  a bother  for them that we walked in to start with. The server disappeared every chance she got, the host with the better than thou attitude was visiting with the last remains of a larger group that left before us walked in.  This same host also had to be dragged way from visiting to print out our bill. We left before the server came back from the dark hole she had been hiding in.  And to not our surprise,  No one of the staff members we had to pass to leave said a word to us. I guess they were to much into chatting among themselves to notice us leaving like the building was on fire. For the price  and service,  I  would recommend any other place than The Pearl.",Heather B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,2010/3/15,Very disappointed.  The fried chicken was so undercooked your could see blood.  The dumplings were average.  Only high point was the corn bread.  Don't plan to return.,Michael T.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,8/18/14,"Amazingly friendly staff, awesomely delicious food. They make a wicked Arnold Palmer too...non alcoholic drinks are my thing.

With avocado and egg, unusual but tasty.",Pam C.,,,,,,

I highly recommend you not make the same mistake as I did. Thank you for the birthday treat!",Amy K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,7/14/15,"The atmosphere is great, I love this place! We ordered the jalapeÌ±o cornbread which is amazing, along with - tots, lamb meatballs, spinach salad and oysters! The food was phenomenal and I love how they use old books for checks!",V A.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,4,2011/8/14,The Pearl is a gem--was there on a busting Friday night for Happy Hour and was it a happy hour.  Service was good and even though busy it was actually possible to have a conversation.  My first taste of the delicious Moscow Mule will not be the last--especially with that touch of ginger to spice it up a bit and served in a copper mug.  The bourbon apple punch and margaritas ordered by my friends were well received.  The fries were tasty so much so that we ordered a second batch; the oysters briny and fresh; the chicken confit (wings) good but not spectacular.  The pork belly taco stole the show--as my friends and I opined--great for the carnivores amongst us.  Hanger steak for dinner excellent!  As the Guide Michelin says:  Ì¤a vaut un dÌ©tour--it's worth a detour!,Diane B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,8/15/13,"We were in town visiting from Cincinnati, and we try to hit the restaurants the locals love. We were led to The Pearl, and were very pleased with our experience. We came in around 10pm on a Wednesday night, so it was not busy. We had exceptionally knowledgable service and had plenty of time to get to know our waiter, and get great answers to our questions about the menu.Our drinks were amazing. Bloody Mary was excellent and the Moscow Mule was perfect according to my wife. They have great beer choices and our server gave us tastes of different drafts to help us decide.We had oysters different ways, and tried a few different oysters from different places. They were amazing and super fresh. The devils on horseback were a great appetizer as well.The fish was farm raised the night we were there which was disappointing. Would have loved some wild caught. They could use a couple of vegan options.Overall, excellent atmosphere, drinks and food. Highly recommend for a night out or celebrating a special occasion. Very expensive, but worth it for the memories.",Sarah C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2001/12/14,"First off, make sure you have a reservation especially on the weekends or you'll end up waiting quite some time for a table. Fantastic atmosphere and very cool patrons. We had a reservation so were day about 10 minutes after arriving. First off, they have a pretty decent drink menu, but I always go for the Moscow Mule, but their house porter on draft is great too. The jalapeÌ±o spoon bread is a great appetizer. I ordered the pub burger and my friend got the roasted half chicken, both delicious choices. The service was absolutely fantastic and made the experience what it was. I think it's a bit overpriced for what it is, but overall, great experience.",Kristen M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2/15/15,"We ate at The Pearl Restaurant on a Sunday evening recently. We tend to dine a little early to avoid a big crowd, but this place was packed by 6pm. My husband started with a Manhattan that lived up to the waiter's description of ""best in town."" (Now he's making them at home!) We tried the jalapeÌ±o corn spoon bread as an appetizer. Very nice presentation with a mini cast iron skillet on a custom wood board. On the side was a generous dollop of whipped butter, drizzled with honey. Fantastic concept, and the flavors were delicious. The only thing that could have been better would have been salted, rather than unsalted butter. The unsalted butter with the honey was a little too sweet, and the salt would have balanced it out and added depth. For our meals, my husband ordered the fish and chips. The fish was fried Lake Erie perch. It was fried just right, and served with plenty of french fries. I got the shrimp and grits, served with short rib kielbasa. The gouda cheese grits were creamy and just the right texture, and the homemade kielbasa was heavenly. There were plenty of shrimp in the nicely sized portion, and the sauce added a smoky note that was just right. We shared a piece of coconut cream pie for dessert. The crust was clearly homemade, very thin and flaky, and expertly roped around the edge. The pie had a perfect, creamy texture and plenty of toasted coconut sprinkled on top. It would have achieved ""best ever"" status with the tiniest change - a little salt in the pie filling. I hate to harp on the salt thing again, because I know it can be a personal preference. But in my opinion, the right amount of salt can make good food GREAT food, without raising one's blood pressure. All in all, this was a very good meal in a restaurant with fantastic decor and atmosphere. We will go back.",Lisa C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2/20/14,"I went to The Pearl for a Sunday brunch. The N'walin Oyster was really good, I especially liked the soupy buttery sauce on it, kinda wished I could have more than 3 small pieces though. The clam chowder was great but not exceptional, but I appreciate that they put real clams in it. The deep fried cheese curds were fun and pleasing. The Benny's Tavern was really good too. I especially liked the ambiance of the place and the speedy customer service. I really wanted to try the Chicken and Waffle because of the good review others were giving, but they were out of it.. may be next time...",Pauline I.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2009/3/13,"I sincerely felt like I wrote a review for the Pearl the first month it opened but that must have been a dream or a plan on my part that never became reality.I've been going to The Pearl since opening night. I've been back time after time.What keeps me coming back?1. The service. Everyone is incredibly friendly. My server from my first time 7 months ago still remembers us and says hello.2. The location. It's gorgeous inside. Just freaking beautiful. The atmosphere alone is worth 4 stars.3. The food. I'll be honest - I've had a few dishes that I was very ""meh"" over. I hunted around and tried a few different dishes but as soon as I had the fried chicken - it was all over. It's surprisingly good. I'm a southern boy who grew up eating fried chicken on a regular basis (even today it's a favorite request of mine to my mom!). This is just about the best I've had in Columbus and even outside my mom's kitchen. I mean - it comes with a cinnamon bun - AS A SIDE! drool....4. The drinks - they are always delish. I mean, one of them comes in a glass punch bowl.5. Brunch - my newest discovery! I love brunch at The Pearl! The bellinis are yummy. My personal favorite for brunch is to get all sides - sausage, potatoes, and a cinnamon bun! If that doesn't sound good - get the fried chicken!So there you have it - why I love the Pearl and still give it 5 stars after 7 months.",Keith M.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,2009/5/14,"I have eaten at many restaurants in many cities and none match what I tasted tonight. We had the oysters raw and baked and they were delicious.  I had the chefs special of ""dinosaur ribs"" (beef long ribs).  OMG what mix of flavors!!!  Service was great but as they got really full there was a slow down as you would suspect but it was excellent.  I recommend this restaurant as a great place for dates, romantic dinners or just hanging out with friends",George K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,4/15/13,"Went there Saturday night at 7pm, our party got seated immediately. First thing we noticed is how nice it was to have a conversation without yelling like Marcella. Pretty good food, our party ordered Hanger Steaks, Grilled Cheese, Artic Char. Plus the clams, cornbread and Devils on a horseback was excellent appetizers. The service was good too, but I think our waiter J. has ADHD. Our favorite is still the Ocean Club for a CM restaurant, nonetheless we'll be going back again.",R M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,6/16/13,"I like short, succinct reviews, but after dinner at The Pearl with friends last night, short just won't do.  This place is a mess.   I will avoid it like the plague in the future and suggest you do also. Here's why:Atmosphere  - I do not know who told the powers that be at Cameron Mitchell headquarters that loud is good. They must think it means cool.  It doesn't.  I thought Marcella's was loud, with its allegedly piped-in noise.  That is sublime next to The Pearl.  Could not hear the waiter (more on him later).  Could not hear ourselves, even across an incredibly small table for four.  This is not fun. It makes an evening out with friends horribly difficult.  Some people actually like to converse with their meals.  Not here.  Oh, did I mention dark?  It is dark.  Ridiculously so.   Tables are small and very close together.   The people next  to you would become your new best friends, if you could only hear them.Waitstaff/Service - Our waiter was hopelessly overmatched by the demands of the job.  He was well-trained in reciting the ""very special to me"" parts of the menu and the drink menu.   After that, it was so bad it would have been funny if we had not been paying for it.  He botched the order.  He got the oysters right.  Of the three beet salads ordered only one came, along with my fried chicken.  One of our companions had asked about the fish.  After having it explained to him, he declined to order it and instead ordered a beet salad to start and said he would order an entrÌ©e later.   The fish arrived anyway, along with one beet salad and my chicken, which I had asked to be held until the others ordered their entrees.  Our companion complained about not ordering the fish but it looked good so he let it go, cancelling his beet salad. My wife sat there with nothing in front of her.   The three of us ate our dishes at her insistence. The waiter explained that the pantry was backed up and he was sorry.  Twenty minutes later and still no salad.  We asked to see the manager. He explained that the salad included a hard-boiled egg and someone hadn't cooked enough during prep. He said my wife's salad would be complementary, as would any dessert we wanted.   In another five minutes, out came not one, but two salads, the waiter having forgotten to cancel the other one.  At this point we were fed up with the whole mess and decided to leave.  Along with this, we couldn't get forks. Every time a plate was cleared, along with the forks, no new forks appeared.  Ever.   The level of service and coordination was equivalent to a first-time restaurant opening night.  If that.Food - The food was good. Not great. Good.  My chicken was moist and the breading nicely done. The beet salads were deemed good.  The fish was rated OK.  The Boston Cream Pie was good.  Value - When you are serving good food it should be at good food prices.  Fried chicken like I had would be great at a chicken shack for $8-$10.  Not for $18.  The fish was $27.  Short ribs were $27. Short Ribs!! The oysters were 3 for $8!!! The wines suffered from a 300% markup.  These prices are in the extraordinary dining experience range. The ambiance and food quality are in the OK range.  I can easily spend that amount at G. Michael's, The Refectory, or other top notch tables and walk away content that I have received excellent value for my money. For good food I can go to Black Creek Bistro or Skillet or other purveyors of much-better-than-it-needs-to-be-for-the-price eateries and also walk away content.  The Pearl offers OK food and mind-numbing noise at grand luxe prices.  There is absolutely no value to be found here.  To add insult to injury, they charge $6 for valet parking.  They put a restaurant in a parking-difficult area of town, ask you to drive there to eat, then gouge you for parking.  Shame on them.Overall - As H.L. Mencken said, ""No one has ever gone broke underestimating the taste of the American people"".   I do not know why this place is popular.  I do not know why people think so little of their hard-earned dollars to spend wayyyy too many of them on something that delivers such poor value. It is like  paying for an Audi 6 and letting them give you a Ford  Focus.   And smiling about it.  I guess the CM people have it down pat in knowing just how far they can push people with disposable income with their ""concepts"".  This one is horrible.  Never again.Final Note:  I am not a young man. I have eaten out often around the world.  I am an ex-chef.  Without a shadow of a doubt I have never left any other restaurant anywhere at any time feeling so cheated about what I received in return for my cash.  I am still mad.",N S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,6/17/13,"I want to love The Pearl SO hard. But I just... can't.I blame it all on the hype amongst Cbus foodies. I think this place was built up to be something truly amazing because we had not seen the likes of a new gastro-pub in awhile, so everyone accepted it as phenomenal when really, it's just another option to Short North dining.First off: make a reservation. I've read some reviews stating that, even with a res, you would have to wait 30 minutes for your table. Thankfully, we had a res but walked right in and were seated immediately.ATMOSPHEREOne is given the illusion from the street looking in that this is an open, well-lit, bustling place to dine with plenty of seating in full view of High Street via open windows. Not so. Most of the seating is in the back. In the dark. Under very strong AC vents that had me shivering through most of our meal.SERVICEMaybe it was just our server, but it was pretty bad. We weren't welcomed, asked if we had been here before, introduced to the menu, told what the catch of the day was. WTH?DRINKSI had the Moscow Mule. It was delectable and strong. My one complaint was the plethora of floaters. Not sure if they were mint or lime or some other herb... but there was definitely too much of it and I had to keep picking it out of my teeth/lips.FOODLet's break this down by what we ordered:- Devils on Horseback (bacon-wrapped dates). Ordered these because everyone we talked to had raved about them. Flavoring is good, and I enjoyed the relish on top, but they don't even compare to the holy grail of dates that Third & Hollywood serves.- Sausage Sampler. This was amazing. Served with kale and sauerkraut and this delicious whole-grain mustard. YUM.- New Orleans Baked Oysters. Flavoring was impeccable, but these were served lukewarm, which detracted from the overall deliciousness. I was especially bummed because this was my boyfriend's first time trying oysters... and he was subjected to sub-par-ness. - Braised Short Rib (he got it). Meat was very tender, but could have used a bit more salt. Portion size was nice. Some would call it ""small"" but I believe we live in a world where oversized portions run rampant.- Arctic Char. The cauliflower puree was surprisingly savory. It paired well with the fish (seared to perfection!) and accompanying veggies (cauliflower, capers, pickles and peppers).Overall, it wasn't a horrible experience. It's just that, I expected more after hearing all of the rave reviews. I'll give it another chance, but not if there's more than a 20 minute wait.",Carolyn K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2005/10/15,"Not incredibly impressed. I enjoyed the atmosphere but the service was terrible.  I get that it was Mother's Day but there were tables seated after Us that were finished eating before our 3 meals came out.  The grilled cheese was good but honestly there was more food on my child's kids meal than on my plate.  A little overpriced for the sandwich and 3 bites or arugula.    No one asked how our meal was, or if we could use anything else.  Deliver the food and take off not to be seen for 25 minutes.   Check please !",S G.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,2001/6/14,"Simply delicious. Pot O Pickles are the bomb!! Everyone at our table got something different, so we nibbled off of each other's plate. I didn't have a single complaint about anything. I really dig the mason jars they serve drinks in.",Joe D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,4/17/16,"First of all, we arrived right when the restaurant opened. We asked to sit at a high top table in the bar. The unfriendly and rude hostess informed us that ""those tables are for people who have reservations."" I have worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years and this is a first! I have never been to a place that reserves ALL bar tables for only those people with reservations. When we arrived, 3 tables were open. The duration of our meal, 2 tables remained open. Absolutely absurd that some tables are not allowed to be utilized by guests without a reservation!! Second, the meal was WAY over priced. I ordered chicken and waffles. At least use a smaller plate to present the food! The meal took up less than half of the huge plate. You are only given 1/2 of a waffle for $14. I have ordered chicken and waffles all over the country in much more expensive cities (Seattle most recently) and everyone serves a full waffle and definitely more chicken. We're not talking about oysters (or something  similarly expensive). We're talking fried chicken and a waffle! None of this is expensive. For $14, you should at least expect a full waffle. I was no where near full and had to eat again once I got home. Should have gone elsewhere for brunch!",G G.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,8/21/13,"Every time I walked past The Pearl since it opened, the same thought came to mind:  ""I really need to try this place.""  From the outside it looked clean, fun, and well-lit.  Water in Mason jars!  Checks delivered inside books!  Servers wearing jeans and vests!  VESTS!  Well-played, Mr. Mitchell.A few weeks ago I (finally) had the opportunity to experience The Pearl with a few friends.  We waited only a few minutes for our reserved table.  Seeing the bright interior and happy, smiling patrons seated at tables upped my Excitement Index considerably.  This was going to be a meal to remember.This is the part of the review where ominous music begins to play in the background.Upon being shown our seats, I learned something about the layout of the restaurant.  That happy, bright, fun area everyone sees from the outside?  That represents perhaps one-third (maybe a little more) of the total seating.  The rest of the seating is found in The Back.  It pains me to say this, but The Back is a low blow to anyone who has expectations of a clean, fun, well-lit dining experience.  The numerous fruit flies surrounding our table were, simply put, disgusting; our conversation was punctuated by random claps as we tried killing the things.  Perhaps we would have been more successful if the owners had sprung for decent lighting in the area.  There's a distinct difference between ""mood lighting"" and ""dingy"".  On the bright (ha!) side, the darkness kept us from seeing dining guests at other tables.  This was a bonus considering how tightly the tables were packed in the space.I felt like I was being punished.  I quickly had to find a positive to the situation.  A drink!  Alcohol makes everything better!  Five or so minutes later I had a Manhattan in front of me.  It was ... fine.  Honestly, I've had better.  Honestly, I've made better at home.  With a $10 price tag, I'd expect a great drink.  This was ... fine.  The Pearl was sinking fast.  Looking at the menu, I wanted something simple.  Throw'em a softball so they had no choice but to succeed.  I chose the pub burger.  Meat is ground daily?  I'll have that medium, thank you.  It turns out $15 does not buy a burger cooked medium.  It was easily medium-well and on the verge of being well-done.  Perhaps that's what happens when a burger is flattened on the grill so it will fill the bun rather than leaving it thicker and juicier and simply using smaller buns.  But what do I know, I'm just a consumer -- and the cooks in the kitchen know what they're doing, right?  Oh, and the fries were warm.  Apparently $15 does not buy hot fries, either.  After eating my overcooked burger with my warm-ish fries in the dark surrounded by flies and sitting a foot away from complete strangers, I was understandably a bit bummed.  I had already spent $25 on a poor experience, so let's round out the evening with dessert!  I do have to say, the Oreo pie was wonderful.  It was easily the highlight of the meal.  Had I know the delight that was the Oreo pie, I would have ordered three of those for dinner and called it a night.It was finally time to leave The Back.  As my eyes adjusted to the light in the bright, cheery, sunny front of the restaurant, I was a bit shell-shocked.  I thought back to my feelings when I first arrived.  Mason jars for water?  Eh.  The book in which my check was delivered?  Ho-hum.  The vests?  Yeah, the vests were ok.  I guess.  Clearly, the Excitement Index had plunged into negative territory, the icy depths from which it was unlikely to surface.Meh.  I've experienced better.  Two stars it is.  Sorry, The Pearl, I won't be back.",Brian S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,7/16/14,"This is definitely Mitchell's best restaurant and possibly one of the best in Columbus. I recommend it to everyone. A little pricey, but worth it. Try the devils on horseback and a Moscow Mule.",Michael R.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,11/19/13,"I had the pleasure of dining at The Peal last night. I have to say, I was not expecting a lot from Columbus, but this place set the bar high! The offer valet, nice, considering parking in this area is limited. The service and the food was excellent! They did not have my choice of beer, but our server suggested something similar and it was great! We started with the Gulf shrimp, and it was better than I've ever had, even at restaurants on the Gulf! For my entree, I had the strip steak, again, fabulous! A great cut of meat, cooked to a perfect mid rare. We even had dessert, the oreo pie, and it was great. Highly recommended, a little pricey (200 + tip for 3 meals, 2 apps, 6 beers and desserts, not terrible, but on the high end), but well worth it.1",Amy S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2007/11/13,"Went for Father's Day brunch at the Pearl and felt like I was back living in NYC for the day. I could easily see this place in Soho (a la Balthazar). Food was good, lots of selections for brunch, with a quirky drink menu (bloody mary comes with a side mini Miller High Life bottle!) The noise level was high and the tables were close, but like I say, NYC style. You either love or hate it. What I especially liked were the details that made this place stand out from other wannabe hip watering holes. Like quaint, kitchen towel-esque cloth napkins and mason jar water glasses. I think it might be a nightmare trying to get a drink here on a Friday night, but for brunch it's the bees knees.",Toni K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,1/15/14,Everyone in our group of 5 really enjoyed their meal. While the filter shows expensive it has some reasonable prices items as well. Only bad thing was that it has a limited menu. But the offerings are quality items.,Matt F.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2010/7/13,"My husband and I had our second dinning experience at The Pearl this past weekend. We had a 8:15 dinner reservation on a Gallery Hop Saturday and were seated as soon as we arrived. Every table was filled, some people we watching the OSU game at the bar and the atmosphere was great.The food was fantastic, as were the cocktails. We shared the deviled eggs (the best I've ever had), parmesan clams and fries while we sipped our moscow mules. For our entrees we had the hanger steak and pork trio, both we so good we were hesitant to let the other sample. Decided to skip dessert this time in favor of a trip to Jeni's down the street, but I still dream about the brown sugar pie.The only downfall was the lack of a Gluten Free menu. He husband and I don't have celiac's disease, but we certainly feel better when we avoid gluten, especially bread, and pasta. There are PLENTY of dishes that don't include those items, but most Cameron Mitchell restaurants have a GF bread/pasta/batter option. Again, not a big deal, I just figured that they would have a few more offerings like Cap City and Marchella's.",Megan D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2002/10/13,"The Pearl is fabulous!  What an grand opening...we dined there Saturday, February 9, the first week it was open.  Everything was running very smoothly, but then that's not a surprise considering this is Cameron Mitchell's restaurant!  We had a reservation at 5:30 p.m.  We were seated within 3 minutes of when we arrived, but first a cocktail server took my drink order!!!  She had to bring it to the table because we were seated so fast.  Do try the barrel aged Margarita.  They are superb!  Best I've ever tasted!!  Jesse was our server.  Love the jeans, checked shirt, vest uniforms!  He suggested two appetizers we tried.  Devils on horseback, cheese stuffed dates, with a savory twist.  The deviled eggs are better than I can make, and I'm good...but more than that, the reason to order them is the presentation.  You won't believe it the way they are served to you!  The four of us tried the beet salad and we loved it.  Roasted golden and purple beets and sliced apple, with avocado, egg and toasted pistachios with a yummy buttermilk dressing.  Not a leaf of lettuce and you don't  won't miss it!  For entrees we tried:  fried chicken, braised short rib and oysters from the raw bar.  Everything was delicious!  The cinnamon sticky bun served with the fried chicken is to die for!  At the end, Jesse told us we simply must try a piece of one of the fresh baked pie selection.  We chose their ""Crack Pie"" which is called that because it is addictive...brown sugar, butter and oats and fabulous whipped cream!  Even at 5:30 p.m. it was completely full of people, a little loud, but not enough to overcome chatting at our table. There seems to be a lot of space for people in the bar to stand.  But if you want to eat there, you probably should make a reservation.  The Pearl is going to be the hot place for quite awhile from the looks of it last night.  We can't wait to try it again.  There are many other things on the menu we can't wait to try.Definitely don't forget to order the deviled eggs!",Margaret B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,9/26/13,"Went there recently to celebrate a birthday. Very crowded on a Tuesday night, reservations are a MUST. The cocktails were delicious, the rum punch was very refreshing but not very strong. The service was fantastic, very kind and thoughtful. Gave us dessert on the house as we were celebrating. Husband had the hanger steak with fried egg and kimchee fried rice. Very flavorful but pretty spicy, beware. The arctic char was good but the best part of the dish was the roasted veggies. Will definitely come back when the dining room isn't packed full.",Katy S.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,6/14/15,"This was one of the best brunches we have ever had.  My husband had the stuffed French toast which was sinfully good! I opted for the short ribs entree which was equally amazing. The service was outstanding.  Everyone had a smile and were very welcoming.  Our waiter, Nick, did a great job.  If you are in downtown Columbus, you have to try this restaurant!",Stacey A.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,4/29/13,"Super excited to get a gift card to be able to try this place and not hold back! We started out with both of the barrel-aged cocktails, which are delicious, but pricey. Worth the try for sure. Of course we had to get some oysters, and the blue point oysters were the only ones left for the evening. It was my first experience eating them, so I'm not sure I can describe the quality of preparation, but I enjoyed them. For my meal I chose the ricotta dumplings, and I'm so glad I did.  Not only were the dumplings themselves perfect, moist, and flavorful, but the potatoes, mushrooms, and crispy kale added great texture and it all went together perfectly. For dessert we went with the butterscotch pie. The chocolate crust was good, but it overpowered the butterscotch. Still pretty good though. Our server was very enthusiastic and ready to answer all of our questions about the menu. They put the check in an old book, which was a cute touch, too.",Liza V.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,6/13/13,"TOTALLY OVERATED.  This place is OK.  As i have heard elsewhere, it seems to be trying to find its identity.  If you are looking for a place to be seen, high noise level and matching high prices, then this is the place for you!  In no way is the food the priority here.  I ordered the fish and chips and my friend ordered the Atlantic char, bothe were mediocre tasting.   We had the Devils on Horseback, which were good, but there were only 5 of them!!! Honestly, you can go to the Hollywood casino for the seafood buffet and have a better meal for a much better price.  Also, it won't take you that long to get seated.  The service is good, if you consider constant interruption during your meal with questions like ""how is it"".  Furthermore, the attention seemed insincere.  Yes, you will need reservations, probably because the Pearl is the current ""it"" spot.  We both agreed, we would not be coming back any time soon!",Pat E.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,5/24/13,"Great food.  Jalapeno corn bread with honey and butter was ridiculous.  And although I was sad to pay $18 for fried chicken (isn't that like a family meal at KFC?), it was so good it was almost worth it.  Lots of flavor and super moist chicken.  As a salt lover, I was impressed how salty the greens were.  And the cinnamon roll, it was how I would imagine eating a fistful of warm frosting -- in a good way.  Arctic char wasn't bad.  I would skip the oysters, those tiny suckers are expensive.  I guess that's what happens when you're landlocked.  Excellent service.  Make a reservation.",Peter L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,1/26/14,"Have been anxious to try, had been looking forward to going. The interior is really cool hipster trendy, restroom narrow and smelled like urine.

The Pearl,578,4,2,7/21/13,"The ambience is cool, oysters were very good. Outside of that, go elsewhere. Cameron Mitchell restaurants have been slipping in quality for years now in my opinion, and this is just one more to add to the list. Service was terrible, despite the fact that we were there at 5pm when the restaurant was otherwise quite empty.  Apparently due to the location, it draws quite the Convention Center crowd...the clientele surely does not match the brand they're trying to establish. We went only bc we had a $150 gift card, so luckily there was no direct impact to my wallet with this visit. Put it this way: I'll never go back.",Stephanie C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2/16/14,"Had the oysters, fried chicken, others in my party had the wings and short ribs, white clam chowder, all really good, there is some talent in the kitchen.  Server was good.But, arrived ten minutes before our reservation, waited thirty minutes to then be offered a high top in the bar.  There were clean and unbussed tables in our view. Several later arriving parties were seated in the small high tops while we waited.  We were a party of four.  Had to refuse the small table and insist on a real table, made me feel uncomfortable refusing that table and sending the seater back to the hostess, who seemed clueless as to what was happening behind her.  It was Sunday evening, maybe the manager was off?And, while waiting the thirty minutes at the bar the mother of a kitchen employee was enjoying a few plates of Belon oysters, nice treat, when we ordered them at the table, they were out, oh so unfortunate, no connection to the table, but under the circumstances turned me off to the place.I'll pass on the future, a shame because its a really nice meal!",Marc P.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,2010/4/14,"First of all I came in with a world renowned wine maker, should have had VIP service but was treated like garbage. Spent $300 in 30 min but had horrible service.

The Pearl,578,4,5,3/19/13,"First of all, I must say that I loved the Burgundy Room, the restaurant that was previously where the Pearl is now. There isn't much that could make me feel better about the Burgundy Room closing, except maybe the Pearl opening. My boyfriend and I went to the Pearl for my birthday last week, and everything was wonderful. We had reservations at 8:30, and we were sat promptly. I ordered a margarita, which was a little small, but then I switched to wine, which was lovely. Our server was very attentive in the best way; he was around, but not too much. He suggested the Devil's on Horseback, and they were delicious. My entree was the Great Lakes Fish and Chips, but the fish was perch. Perch! I grew up on Lake Erie eating fresh perch all the time, and this is the first place I've found perch in my 13(!) years in Columbus. Order the Great Lakes Fish and Chips. My boyfriend got the fried chicken entree, which was good, but mine was better. When we asked our server to take our picture because it was my birthday, he did, and then he asked if he could bring out some free pie. Of course! Who says no to any pie, let alone free pie? The Crack Pie was also very good. Overall, it was a great evening. The service was fabulous, and I heard the price was reasonable.",Brieanna H.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,4/19/13,"What a great new spot for the Short North.  I came here opening weekend and so did the rest of Columbus.

The Pearl,578,4,3,2008/9/13,"It's a cool design.  Love the subway tile and mason jar. The drinks are better than good.  The service is great.  But then it's a little down hill and unfortunately, the thing that's most important - the food - is just average.  I'm torn on Cameron Mitchell joints in general.  They tend to be more style than substance.  A box version of a popular concept.  That's exactly what this place is.  Really average food with fancy names pretending to be fine dining in a very manufactured setting.  It's just doesn't feel right.  It's worth a visit or two.",Richard B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2001/12/14,"Service, food, and drinks couldn't have been any better.  It might be some of the most amazing brunch I have ever eaten.  The chicken and waffles were out of this world delicious.  Can't wait to come back for dinner!",Jodi L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2002/10/13,"Four of us went to the new kid in town, The Pearl, to check it out. We all eat out a lot and need to know the newest great place to go! It was busy and the atmosphere is fun. We started with the ""Devils on Horseback"" cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. They were good, not the very best stuffed dates, but very good..another place in town does a similiar date appetizer I like a bit more. But they were very tasty. We also had the pork bao buns. The pork was very tasty, the bun was a bit odd. I didn't love them. We also ordered half a dozen Chesapeake oysters. No complaints on the oysters. Yum! Only wish I could have had a true mignonette sauce with them vs. the horseradish one. The horseradish way overpowered what is so wonderful about a mignonette. And I love horseradish. For entrees, two out four of us ordered the chicken. They both loved it. I tried their cinnamon sticky bun. It was totally awesome...but; from a purely marketing standpoint I am a bit confused why they serve a big sweet bun at dinner. It seems to kill the idea of anyone ordering that entree will ever order a dessert. I can see that as a great brunch idea, when most don't order dessert anyway. (Maybe a big southern biscuit or cornbread on the savory side would leave them wanting a sweet after dinner?) I ordered the Cuban entree...and, as it turned out is a sandwich. I had no idea. It doesn't say anywhere. So, it was a bit surprising. I had read it as a pork confit, (often served in a small dish or on top of the other items.). It also had a slice of some other type of meat on it, which, I didn't like too much. The black bean stew was good that was a side. Our last entree that was ordered was the braised short rib. He didn't say much, but kept eating. I take that as a good sign. We didn't order any dessert. All-in all, it was good, Not blown away. The menu seemed a bit more meat-oriented than I expected, but hey, we're in the midwest. I am really excited to have an oyster bar to come sit at and watch them shuck oysters as quickly as I eat them. After living in Boston for twenty years then moving back, I've missed that sort of thing.Go, enjoy. It's good.",Kira K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2010/6/13,The seafood tower is amazing but it is also around $90 if you're looking to do some spending!

The food was phenomenal we both had oysters and the braised short rib with a few glasses of wine. The service however was awful. 30 minutes passed by without our oysters for our appetizers. We finally managed to flag down the server and she told us they are shucking the oysters now. We think she forgot to put the order in since two tables sat down and ordered after us and they all got their oysters before us. About 10 minutes later we finally received our oysters, it should not take 40 minutes for oysters. After that our service went more smoothly. Overall I would defiantly go back again but would pray to not get the same server. She was just struggling the whole time we were there with three tables",Erin D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,7/16/13,Apps are hearty and rich. I love deviled eggs.  Great  drinks and draft selection. Oysters are pretty darn good for Columbus. Entrees are hit or miss. Desserts are over the top...prices are in line with other spots in town.,Jon B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,11/16/13,The best oyster bar in Ohio that I know of. Great oyster selection to choose from. Had 7 different types the other night so I ordered two of each.

The Pearl,578,4,3,2002/9/13,"We had reservations the third night (a Thursday) after opening, the place was packed.  We were sat at a hi- top table near the bar and were able to order drinks and snacks quickly but we eventually had to initiate the order for our dinner (maybe our server thought we were just having drinks and snacks?) . There were 3 of us and we ordered the Crispy Fried Curds, old Fashioned Deviled Eggs, Pot-o-Pickles as snacks then Southern Fried Chicken, Grilled Cheese and the Cuban.  I tried a little of everything... we all liked the snacks.  I wasn't a big fan of the sweetness from the ""Pearl Jam"" in the Grilled Cheese, the Cuban was ok, the pork was stringy/ pulled and made the bread soggy on the inside which we didn't like, the Fried Chicken was good but we wished it came with the JalapeÌ±o Corn Spoon Bread rather than the Cinnamon Sticky Bun...the Sticky Bun it's own was amazing, we just didn't like it with the Chicken.

The Pearl,578,4,2,7/23/14,"Went to The Pearl a few days ago for restaurant week.  We made 8:30 reservations, and when we showed up, our table was not ready, and they handed up a buzzer.  We ended up waiting 40 minutes for our table that we RESERVED.  They apologized, saying they had other big parties.  But isn't that the point of reservations?  It gives the restaurant a chance to manage large tables, knowing that other parties are going to arrive at certain times.  The food was good, but unfortunately botching reservations is a line in the sand.  I will not be back.  Understandably, as I dine with clients often, I would never risk making reservations here again, the service is simply too unreliable.",Liz A.,,,,,,

Heard the punch was good but was disappointed.atmosphere, service and oysters are worth it. it is expensive so might not be your best bet if you're not looking to enjoy oysters.

The Pearl,578,4,4,4/15/13,"We had a great dinner here over the weekend celebrating my husband's birthday. We had a great table in the front right by the windows. I can't remember our servers name but he was excellent. It took him a little while to come over initially but he did stop by and say he would be a couple minutes so that was okay. We ordered drinks and the deviled eggs, parmesan baked clams, and devil on horseback, all were fantastic but the eggs did have a lot of onions in them so if you aren't a fan I would steer clear of those. For dinner we ordered the grilled cheese, two of us picked the fried chicken (sticky bun was awesome), and my husband ordered the short ribs. We all really enjoyed our meals but the short rib was I think the winner although I didn't love the horseradish mashed potatoes personally.  The portions were ample although the grilled cheese was kind of small, I would maybe order a side of the chowder or fries as they look delicious.I thought maybe they would recognize that it was my husband's birthday but they didn't, not a huge deal.  We did order the ""crack pie"" which they are apparently not allowed to call it anymore so its the brown sugar pie.  It was really good but not the best pie I have ever eaten.  It was a good dessert to split though after the dinner.  I would definitely make reservations, I think I had to go 2-3 weeks out.  Once thing to note there was a little drama at the Oyster bar, apparently the seats may or may not be first come first serve so I would check with the hostess just to be sure.  We couldn't get the whole story but there was some controversy over who should have gotten the open seats so best to check.  The staff seemed to handle it well so kudos to them.

Extra points for the fun presentation of butter and honey.I went on a Sunday for brunch with a friend. We both went with the huevos rancheros. They don't look or taste at all like what you expect, but they are really good and I actually enjoyed the novelty of a new approach to a classic.

The Pearl,578,4,5,5/27/13,"This place is packed for a reason. If there aren't any tables, try a spot by the oyster bar. It's a cool spot to sit, plus you get up close and personal to the kitchen action. The jalopeno cornbread is a must to try. I had the fried chicken dinner which came with a side of greens. They were yummy, albeit a little on the salty side. If they tone down the salt, they'd be perfect. The dish also comes with a huge cinnamon roll--a play on the chicken and waffles bit that's so famous--and just as delicious. I also tried the beet salad which had an awesome flavor profile. Will definitely be back again and again.",Dee C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2008/8/13,"This new restaurant is the best spot for oysters in Columbus. Additionally they have legit Moscow Mules which set the place apart from the competiion. The decor is cool, the location is great, and the wait staff is nice/knowledgable. Pricing is out of line on some items (such as baked oysters - $11 for 3 - Cmon should be 6) and of course it is always crowded because of the Short North location (but that comes with the territory).

The twist they put on each one to make it their own dish is spot on!!  Now for the not so good....We made reservations more than a month in advance for my birthday celebration. Twelve people on a Saturday night.  Even with the reservations made out so far in advance we had to wait for almost an hour past our reso time for our table. Then the table they offered only had seating for ten people. We then had to wait another ten minutes for the only table large enough to accommodate a party of twelve.  My suggestion...go with a party of two/four people. Expect time at the bar before dinner to enjoy their great drink menu and then have a great meal.  This is a rare combination of trendy with well above average food.",Jeffrey S.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,5,2007/10/13,"This is one of my top five favorite restaurants in town. We've been here multiple times, largely because of the selection of oysters. They typically have 5-6 options to choose from, all fresher tasting than any other place in town I've tried. They come with a terrific cocktail sauce and horseradish. We almost always get the smoked salmon as well, it's always good and the tartar sauce they provide with it is the perfect compliment. Most of the cocktails are good, but the margarita here is fantastic. Really good beer selection.Other standout items include the burger, which is perhaps the best in town, and the clam chowder. The atmosphere is inviting and the service has always been phenomenal.",Kris S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2007/7/15,"I had brunch here on 7/6/15 with my wife, my dad, my sister and her honey.  This was the first time that my wife and I had eaten here, since we were from out of town visiting.  We had the jalapeno cornbread that was so good that they could have put it on the dessert menu.  My wife ordered the beet salad and she said that she would definitely have it again.  My sister and I both had the Waffles and Chicken.  It came with a warm blueberry sauce and an Ohio honey maple syrup.  We both loved them.  If I could have squeezed it in, I would have had another.  My sister's honey had the Huevos Rancheros and enjoyed them immensely.  Unfortunately, this is where things went a little south.  He ordered another beverage and it took almost 10 minutes to get it.  Then he ordered some more tortillas for his dish and they were not delivered until he was completely done with the dish.  I would have probably given the experience an ""A"" except for the services snafus.",Tom C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,7/26/14,"Had an absolutely wonderful experience there. We arrived for dinner early so we could get appetizers and drinks off of their happy hour menu. This is probably the best happy hour menu I have ever seen. I wanted to try oysters for the first time and they were only 2 for $3 on the happy hour menu as opposed to 3 for $8. Nearly every drink is half-price and a majority of their amazing appetizers are on the happy hour menu at a reduced price. It's a great way to sample lots of great tastes for little $$. The service was top-notch as well. The waiter was very  informative when we asked for suggestions. The waiter made a point to swing by to take one last drink order before happy hour ended.   The specialty cocktails and punches were all delicious.  The entrees were delicious too, and to top it all off, the waiter gave us a free dessert. I wish I lived closer to Columbus so I could go there more often.",Michael C.,,,,,,

I had the Cuban sandwich (which I split with another person), it had amazing flavor & was big enough that I felt full with only eating half of it!  Other members of our party order the steak, & pork trio.  The food was devoured and everyone raved about what they had. This will most definitely become a regular spot for me!",Victoria C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,4/23/15,"I want to begin with stating that I love Cameron Mitchell for all that he does and it pains me to write a poor review of any of his restaurants but the service here is lacking and there is a definite need for more vegetarian options.  I do not know what percentage of the Short North is vegetarian or vegan but I imagine it is substantial.  When I asked the server if certain items could be served without meat, she told me to go down the street to other restaurants where there are more vegetarian options because this was just not a place where many options could be found.  As a former server and bartender and as someone who has worked for Cameron Mitchell, I found this completely unacceptable.  With that stated, after picking meat out of the food I ordered, I must say it was good.  But really?  ""Go somewhere else"" rather than accommodating the customer?  There is no reason for this.  She acted as if she had never heard of a vegetarian diet before.",Elle D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,2001/10/14,"My husband and I had a fantastic dinner here.  We had reservations, but because of the weather, we were running a bit late.  When we arrived, the hostess said that they were also running a little behind.  I didn't wait more than 2-3 min before being escorted back to our table.  Everything was amazing, the server was polite, friendly and checked on us just enough, but not too much.  I had the beet salad.  I LOVE beets, so when this arrived to my table, I was pleasantly surprised because it was not your typical beet salad.  The addition of avocados and a creamy dressing made it ""melt in your mouth"" good.  For entrees, we had the artic char and braised short rib.  There was not a bite left on the artic char plate.  It was so good, and I'll definitely look forward to the next time I can have it.  My husband enjoyed his short ribs.  Overall, the ambiance of the place is very nice, and it's just a great place to have a date.  We can't wait to go back!",Sarah A.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,1,10/29/13,"I wish it was all I had dreamed it would be.  There were some cool things like the check being brought in an old book but that did not make up for the poor service and I mean practically non existent, gritty oysters, greasy food and $5.00 can of beer...beer, in a can for $5.00.  We love the Ocean Club and were hoping for a casual laid back version...not to be realized.",Mystery Diner P.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,3/17/14,"Went on Friday night, very busy...only reason not 5 star was due to confusion at the front with getting us seated. After reminding them we had missed seating us, they apologized and followed up with 2 complimentary appetizers. Devils on horseback and house smoked salmon were great! So was cornbread... Short ribs and half chicken were both wonderful. Beer menu was nice, good variety... Service was prompt and helpful. Wife and I are definitely coming back.",Aaron B.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,2005/4/14,We sat at the Oyster Bar just after the Derby finished - a great way to get a seat when you don't have reservations. Appetizers (Smoked Salmon Deviled Eggs and Devils on Horseback) were truly delicious. Good selections of beer + wine. We took our time enjoying each appetizer separately. Our server was absolutely wonderful! I'll plan to return for dinner next trip to Columbus!,Moira L.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,2003/9/14,"While the menu and concept are great, the food just never seems to be all that good. Went to brunch on a Saturday and had a great table and a really nice server. We ordered vegetarian huevos rancheros & the eggs Benny. The huevos were so strongly BBQ flavored they they sadly weren't worth eating. Tortillas came on the side & the consistency of the dish was all kind of mushy.  The eggs Benny was ok, but not much flavor and it again was all kind of underwhelming. This was my last time trying to again be disappointed at the pearl.",Nina M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,4/14/13,It was medium.  Had an early dinner with friends two weeks ago--our first visit.  Everything about it was average.  Cannot figure out what all the fuss is about.,Monica H.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,1/23/14,Was missing San Fran and had dinner here during the holidays. Great ambiance! Awesome drinks and the short ribs were to die for! Food was seasoned so well!definitely had a food orgasm and great service!,L S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,3,2/25/13,"Easily got reservations for a Tuesday night about a week in advance to have dinner with some girl friends. There's been enough on the ambiance so I don't think I need to go over that. At 6:15 the place was full around the bar area but mostly empty everywhere else. Well by 7pm this place was packed, shoulder to shoulder, people eating and drinking standing up. A little insane. Drink wise I went with the Moscow mule, which I've loved ever since I had one for the first time at the Jury Room. Here they serve it in fancy rustic cooper mug thingamig. Goes with the mason jar, DIY, Pinterest wedding, rustic, theme they have going on here circa 2010 (yeah, that was a bit of a backhanded compliment, but it's Ohio. We're a little behind here). I didn't care  much for the crushed ice - better suited for the summer time, BUT the crushed ice did seem to keep the drink really cold and from getting super watery. I also didn't care for the lime pulp I kept having to pull out of my teeth every time I took a drink. YUCK! Thankfully I was just dining with my friends. Ordered some oysters - we got 3 of 4 kinds they were offering so we each got to try 1 of each. $8 for 3 oysters seems kinda pricey but the rent for this location ain't gonna pay for itself. Also, we're in freaking Ohio not a coastal city so no $1 oysters here. I like whichever one they placed in the middle of my plate. No idea which region that one was from. As for my entree, I went with the fried chicken. Lots and lots of chicken but is fried chicken really worth $18? Again paying for the cool atmosphere and rent location. Didn't care for the collard greens side. I prefer my collards in juice form. Cinnamon roll was awesome. Tried the coleslaw from my friend's fish and chips - yum! Will probably stick to snack and starters next time, and maybe a glass of wine or margarita instead.",Laura C.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,4,11/17/13,"I've been in to The Pearl a few times now and have always had a consistently yummy meal. I recently went for brunch and had the stuffed french toast with banana rum spice filling - it was absolutely delicious! The decor is nice, although it does seem like they're trying a little too hard to be hipster.",Krissy K.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,6/22/13,"How a place can open at 4 yet have no valet or any other type parking available until 5:30 is beyond me. Luckily the staff was very helpful in preventing a tow by the hovering tow trucks from what would eventually become the valet lot. Crazy!!! Otherwise the food and service were  great but I'm afraid the parking situation will keep us away, especially on the weekends. If but for the parking fiasco it would at least get a 4 as do all Cameron Mitchell restaurants.",Wayne S.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,5,8/15/13,This place is excellent. It's a southern      gastro-pub with oysters. The crack pie is a must have.,Jonathan M.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,8/21/13,"Visited for the first time today, had the Tower.  The quality is definitely good....but not great.  The shrimp, lobster and oysters were great, the clams were just average.  The horseradish and cocktail sauce were boring and bland.  The Lagunista IPA was exceptional.  Greg, our server, was knowledgable, friendly and attentive.  The price for the Tower ($90)  ended up not being worth it.  Seemed more like a $70 presentation.  The interior of The Pearl is awesome...great low lighting and ambience.  The bartender did not use the beertap glass cleaner for the right amount of time; only 2-3 seconds.  Definitely a great place but the Tower is a disappointment.  I was torn between 2 or 3 stars, went with 2.",Red D.,,,,,,
The Pearl,578,4,2,7/28/13,"Been here a few times, now, and, on the first visit, absolutely loved it!  Had the oysters and some shimp and both were really fresh and delicious!  On my second and third visits, however, the food was disappointing.  Tried the cheese curds and french fries along with the oysters and shrimp and, although the seafood was good, the cheese curds were underwhelming and the french fries were soggy and had an ""old"" flavor to them.  Service, on all three occasions, was not the greatest.  Sat at the bar and, although there were several bartenders behind a fairly small, 12 or so seat bar, service was very slow and the bartenders definitely had a bit of an ""attitude"".  Not to say I wouldn't give it another shot, but it is not on my list of places to go in the near future.",Abby D.,,,,,,

The Pearl,578,4,3,12/13/13,My family had been wanting to eat at The Pearl for a really long time and when a girl I work with that has the pickiest pallet I know liked it I was in. We made a reservation weeks in advance for my birthday and received an email that was forwarded to all guests to let them know the time of our dinner. Our reservation was for 6 people at 8:00 pm. We arrived to the restaurant at 7:55 and I was pleased with the charming decor. The hostess told us it would be a little bit of a wait and did not apologize so I thought it would be maybe 10 minutes. At around 8:25 my brother asked her when we would be seated. She gave him a snarky attitude and said she cannot predict when the people at our table would get up. We were finally seated at 8:42 and did not receive a single apology from either of the two people at the hostess stand even though we had reservations at 8:00. Even with a bitter start I went into the food with an open mind. Overall everything was decent. The one thing that I found particularly delicious was a taste of my brother in law's burger. The oysters were very fresh but I did not find anything else to be above and beyond. The staff was enough to make me not go back.,Brooke S.,,,,,,
